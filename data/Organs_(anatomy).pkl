V the thyroid gland or simply the thyroid \u02c8\u03b8a\u026ar\u0254\u026ad is one of the largest endocrine glands in the body and consists of two connected lobes it is found in the anterior neck below the laryngeal prominence adams apple the thyroid gland controls rate of use of energy sources protein synthesis and controls the bodys sensitivity to other hormones it participates in these processes by producing thyroid hormones the principal ones being thyroxine t4 and triiodothyronine t3 which is more active these hormones regulate the growth and rate of function of many other systems in the body t3 and t4 are synthesized from iodine and tyrosine the thyroid also produces calcitonin which plays a role in calcium homeostasis hormonal output from the thyroid is regulated by thyroidstimulating hormone tsh produced by the anterior pituitary which itself is regulated by thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh produced by the hypothalamus  the thyroid may be affected by some frequent thyroid diseases hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones the most common cause being graves diseasean autoimmune disorder in contrast hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient thyroid hormone production worldwide the most common cause is iodine deficiency thyroid hormones are important for development and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability  in iodinesufficient regions the most common cause of hypothyroidism is hashimotos thyroiditisalso an autoimmune disease in addition the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer   the thyroid gland is a butterflyshaped organ and is composed of two conelike lobes or wings lobus dexter right lobe and lobus sinister left lobe connected via the isthmus each lobe is about 5cm long 3cm wide and 2cm thick the organ is situated on the anterior side of the neck lying against and around the larynx and trachea reaching posteriorly the oesophagus and carotid sheath it starts cranially at the oblique line on the thyroid cartilage just below the laryngeal prominence or adams apple and extends inferiorly to approximately the fifth or sixth tracheal ring  it is difficult to demarcate the glands upper and lower border with vertebral levels because it moves position in relation to these during swallowing there is occasionally 2855 of population mean 443  a third lobe present called the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland it is of conical shape and extends from the upper part of the isthmus up across the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone the pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the fetal thyroid stalk or thyroglossal duct  it is occasionally quite detached or may be divided into two or more parts the pyramidal lobe is also known as lalouettes pyramid  the thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous sheath the capsula glandulae thyreoideae composed of an internal and external layer the external layer is anteriorly continuous with the pretracheal fascia and posteriorolaterally continuous with the carotid sheath the gland is covered anteriorly with infrahyoid muscles and laterally with the sternocleidomastoid muscle also known as sternomastoid muscle on the posterior side the gland is fixed to the cricoid and tracheal cartilage and cricopharyngeus muscle by a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as berrys ligament   the thyroid glands firm attachment to the underlying trachea is the reason behind its movement with swallowing  in variable extent the pyramidal lobe is present at the most anterior side of the lobe in this region the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in the ligament and tubercle between the two layers of the capsule and on the posterior side of the lobes there are on each side two parathyroid glands the thyroid isthmus is variable in presence and size can change shape and size and can encompass the pyramidal lobe lobus or processus pyramidalis  the thyroid is one of the larger endocrine glands weighing 23grams in neonates and 1860grams in adults and is increased in pregnancy in a healthy person the gland is not visible yet can be palpated as a soft mass examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size  the thyroid is supplied with arterial blood from the superior thyroid artery a branch of the external carotid artery and the inferior thyroid artery a branch of the thyrocervical trunk and sometimes by the thyroid ima artery branching directly from the subclavian artery the venous blood is drained via superior thyroid veins draining in the internal jugular vein and via inferior thyroid veins draining via the plexus thyreoideus impar in the left brachiocephalic vein lymphatic drainage passes frequently the lateral deep cervical lymph nodes and the pre and paratracheal lymph nodes the gland is supplied by parasympathetic nerve input from the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the embryo at 34 weeks of gestation the thyroid gland appears as an epithelial proliferation in the floor of the pharynx at the base of the tongue between the tuberculum impar and the copula linguae at a point later indicated by the foramen cecum the thyroid then descends in front of the pharyngeal gut as a bilobed diverticulum through the thyroglossal duct over the next few weeks it migrates to the base of the neck passing anterior to the hyoid bone during migration the thyroid remains connected to the tongue by a narrow canal the thyroglossal duct thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh and thyroidstimulating hormone tsh start being secreted from the fetal hypothalamus and pituitary at 1820 weeks of gestation and fetal production of thyroxine t4 reach a clinically significant level at 1820 weeks  fetal triiodothyronine t3 remains low less than 15ngdl until 30 weeks of gestation and increases to 50ngdl at term  fetal selfsufficiency of thyroid hormones protects the fetus against eg brain development abnormalities caused by maternal hypothyroidism  however preterm births can suffer neurodevelopmental disorders due to lack of maternal thyroid hormones due their own thyroid being insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs  the portion of the thyroid containing the parafollicular cells also known as c cells responsible for the production of calcitonin are derived from neural crest this is first seen as the ultimobranchial body which begins in the ventral fourth pharyngeal pouch and joins the primordial thyroid gland during its descent to its final location in the anterior neck aberrations in prenatal development can cause various forms of thyroid dysgenesis at the microscopic level there are three primary features of the thyroid first discovered by geoffary websterson in 1664  the thyroid is composed of spherical follicles that selectively absorb iodine as iodide ions i  from the blood for production of thyroid hormones and also for storage of iodine in thyroglobulin twentyfive percent of the bodys iodide ions are in the thyroid gland inside the follicles in a region called the follicular lumen colloid serves as a reservoir of materials for thyroid hormone production and to a lesser extent acts as a reservoir for the hormones themselves colloid is rich in a protein called thyroglobulin the follicles are surrounded by a single layer of follicular cells which secrete t3 and t4 when the gland is not secreting t3 and t4 inactive the epithelial cells range from low columnar to cuboidal cells when active the epithelial cells become tall columnar cells scattered among follicular cells and in spaces between the spherical follicles are another type of thyroid cell parafollicular cells also called c cells which secrete calcitonin the primary function of the thyroid is production of the hormones t3 t4 and calcitonin up to 80 of the t4 is converted to t3 by organs such as the liver kidney and spleen t3 is several times more powerful than t4 which is largely a prohormone perhaps four  or even ten times more active  iodidethe ionized form of iodineis essential for proper thyroid function iodide is taken up by follicular cells through the sodiumiodide symporter nis present on the basolateral membrane which transports two sodium cations and one iodide ion into the cell it works against the iodide concentration gradient and uses energy of sodium gradient maintained by the sodiumpotassium pump and therefore acts by secondary active transport thus nis help to maintain a 20 to 40fold difference in iodide concentration across the membrane  this iodide is transported to the follicular space through the apical membrane of the follicular cell with the help of the iodidechloride antiporter pendrin this iodide is then oxidized to iodine and attached to thyroglobulin by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase to form the precursors of thyroid hormones  thyroxine t4 is synthesised by the follicular cells from the tyrosine residues of the protein called thyroglobulin tg it has 123 tyrosine residues but only 46 are active iodine is captured with the iodine trap by the hydrogen peroxide generated by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase tpo  and linked to the 3 and 5 sites of the benzene ring of the tyrosine residues on tg sequentially on tyrosine residue forming monoiodotyrosine mit and then diiodotyrosine dit iodination two dit can couple coupling to form t4 hormone attached to thyroglobulin releasing one alanine upon stimulation by the thyroidstimulating hormone tsh the follicular cells reabsorb tg and cleave the iodinated tyrosines from tg in lysosomes forming free t4 dit mit t3 and traces of rt3 in t3 and rt3 has three iodine atom while t4 has four and releasing t3 and t4 into the blood deiodinase releases the sequestred iodine from mit and dit deiodinase enzymes convert t4 to t3 and rt3   which is a major source of both rt3 95 and t3 87 in peripheral tissues thyroid hormone secreted from the gland is about 8090 t4 and about 1020 t3   cells of the developing brain are a major target for the thyroid hormones t3 and t4 thyroid hormones play a particularly crucial role in brain maturation during fetal development  a transport protein that seems to be important for t4 transport across the bloodbrain barrier oatp1c1 has been identified  a second transport protein mct8 is important for t3 transport across brain cell membranes  nongenomic actions of t4 are those that are not initiated by liganding of the hormone to intranuclear thyroid receptor these may begin at the plasma membrane or within cytoplasm plasma membraneinitiated actions begin at a receptor on the integrin alphav beta3 that activates erk12 this binding culminates in local membrane actions on ion transport systems such as the na h  exchanger or complex cellular events including cell proliferation these integrins are concentrated on cells of the vasculature and on some types of tumor cells which in part explains the proangiogenic effects of iodothyronines and proliferative actions of thyroid hormone on some cancers including gliomas t4 also acts on the mitochondrial genome via imported isoforms of nuclear thyroid receptors to affect several mitochondrial transcription factors regulation of actin polymerization by t4 is critical to cell migration in neurons and glial cells and is important to brain development t3 can activate phosphatidylinositol 3kinase by a mechanism that may be cytoplasmic in origin or may begin at integrin alpha v beta3 in the blood t4 and t3 are partially bound to thyroxinebinding globulin tbg transthyretin and albumin only a very small fraction of the circulating hormone is free unbound  t4 003 and t3 03 only the free fraction has hormonal activity as with the steroid hormones and retinoic acid thyroid hormones cross the cell membrane and bind to intracellular receptors \u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b21 and \u03b22 which act alone in pairs or together with the retinoid xreceptor as transcription factors to modulate dna transcription  the production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroidstimulating hormone tsh released by the anterior pituitary the thyroid and thyrotropes in the anterior pituitary form a negative feedback loop tsh production is suppressed when the free t4 levels are high the negative feedback occurs on both the hypothalamus and the pituitary but it is of particular importance at the level of the pituitary  the tsh production itself is modulated by thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh which is produced by the hypothalamus this is secreted at an increased rate in situations such as cold exposure to stimulate thermogenesis which is prominent in case of infants tsh production is blunted by dopamine and somatostatin srih which act as local regulators at the level of the pituitary in response to rising levels of glucocorticoids and sex hormones estrogen and testosterone and excessively high blood iodide concentration an additional hormone produced by the thyroid contributes to the regulation of blood calcium levels parafollicular cells produce calcitonin in response to hypercalcemia calcitonin stimulates movement of calcium into bone in opposition to the effects of parathyroid hormone pth however calcitonin seems far less essential than pth as calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid thyroidectomy but not the parathyroids t3 of particular physiological importance produced mainly in tissue after deiodination it has calorigenic cardiovascular neural and other metabolic actions it increases oxygen consumption of all tissues except brain uterus testis though it is important for normal fertility lymph node spleen and its source anterior pituitary mainly by its action on sodium potassium pump and fat metabolism it is helps in conversion of carotene into vitamin a in hepatic cells therefore hypothyroidism may lead to high levels of carotene in the blood resulting in yellowish tint of only skin and not the mucous membrane like sclera it increases growth and results in positive nitrogen usage protein anabolism but high levels result in protein catabolism produced potassium due to catabolism appears in urine decreased level of thyroid hormone result in retention of hyaluronic acid and chronditin sufluric acid in the skin which results in water retention due to polyolic nature and myxedema it also has significance in proper mentation increased levels results in irritability decreased levels results in poor mentation and increased protein level in csf it has significance in proper development of cochlea and hypothyroidism may lead to low iq and deaf mutism many cardiovascular effects are reported increased peripheral resistance increased rate and force of heart beat occurs by effects of circulatory t3  it increases carbohydrate absorption it is also reported to decrease cholesterol levels thyroid disorders include all these disorders may give rise to a goiter that is an enlarged thyroid hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid is defined as an overproduction of the thyroid hormones t3 and t4 this condition is most commonly caused by the development of graves disease an autoimmune disease in which anomalous antibodies stimulate the thyroid to secrete excessive quantities of thyroid hormones  the disease can progress to the formation of a toxic goiter as a result of thyroid growth in response to a lack of negative feedback mechanisms it presents with symptoms such as a thyroid goiter protruding eyes exopthalmos palpitations excess sweating diarrhea weight loss muscle weakness and unusual sensitivity to heat the appetite is often increased beta blockers are used to decrease symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as increased heart rate tremors anxiety and heart palpitations and antithyroid drugs are used to decrease the production of thyroid hormones in particular in the case of graves disease these medications take several months to take full effect and have sideeffects such as skin rash or a drop in white blood cell count which decreases the ability of the body to fight off infections these drugs involve frequent dosing often one pill every 8 hours and often require frequent doctor visits and blood tests to monitor the treatment and may sometimes lose effectiveness over time due to the sideeffects  and inconvenience of such drug regimens some patients choose to undergo radioactive iodine131 treatment radioactive iodine is administered in order to destroy a portion of or the entire thyroid gland since the radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the gland and gradually destroys the cells of the gland alternatively the gland may be partially or entirely removed surgically though iodine treatment is usually preferred since the surgery is invasive and carries a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands or the nerves controlling the vocal cords if the entire thyroid gland is removed hypothyroidism results  hypothyroidism is the underproduction of the thyroid hormones t3 and t4 hypothyroid disorders may occur as a result of typical symptoms are abnormal weight gain tiredness baldness cold intolerance and bradycardia hypothyroidism is treated with hormone replacement therapy such as levothyroxine which is typically required for the rest of the patients life thyroid hormone treatment is given under the care of a physician and may take a few weeks to become effective  negative feedback mechanisms result in growth of the thyroid gland when thyroid hormones are being produced in sufficiently low quantities as a means of increasing the thyroid output however where hypothyroidism is caused by iodine insufficiency the thyroid is unable to produce t3 and t4 and as a result the thyroid may continue to grow to form a nontoxic goiter it is termed nontoxic as it does not produce toxic quantities of thyroid hormones despite its size there are two types of thyroiditis where initially hyperthyroidism presents which is followed by a period of hypothyroidism the overproduction of t3 and t4 followed by the underproduction of t3 and t4 these are hashimotos thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis hashimotos thyroiditis or hashimotos disease is an autoimmune disorder whereby the bodys own immune system reacts with the thyroid tissues in an attempt to destroy it at the beginning the gland may be overactive and then becomes underactive as the gland is damaged resulting in too little thyroid hormone production or hypothyroidism some patients may experience swings in hormone levels that can progress rapidly from hypertohypothyroid sometimes mistaken as severe moodswings or even being bipolar before the proper clinical diagnosis is made some patients may experience these swings over a longer period of time over days or weeks or even months hashimotos is more common in females than males usually appearing after the age of 30 and tends to run in families meaning it can be seen as a genetic disease also more common in individuals with hashimotos thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes and celiac disease  postpartum thyroiditis occurs in some females following the birth of a child after delivery the gland becomes inflamed and the condition initially presents with overactivity of the gland followed by underactivity in some cases the gland may recover with time and resume its functions in others it may not the etiology is not always known but can sometimes be attributed to autoimmunity such as hashimotos thyroiditis or graves disease there are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid and these include subacute thyroiditis acute thyroiditis silent thyroiditis and riedels thyroiditis  in most cases thyroid cancer presents as a painless mass in the neck it is very unusual for thyroid cancers to present with symptoms unless they have been neglected one may be able to feel a hard nodule in the neck diagnosis is made using a needle biopsy and various radiological studies  many individuals may find the presence of thyroid nodules on the gland the majority of these thyroid nodules are benign non cancerous and their presence does not necessarily indicate disease most thyroid nodules do not cause any symptoms and most are discovered on an incidental examination often there can be many nodules which is termed a multinodular goiter doctors usually perform a needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid to determine the status of the nodules if the nodule is found to be noncancerous no other treatment is required if the nodule is suspicious then surgery is recommended a persistent thyroglossal duct or cyst is the most common clinically significant congenital anomaly of the thyroid gland a persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland parts of this tube may be obliterated leaving small segments to form cysts these occur at any age and might not become evident until adult life mucinous clear secretions may collect within these cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter these are present in the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foreamen cecum the anomalies that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium characteristically next to the lining epithelium there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities and rarely give rise to cancers  another anomaly is that of thyroid dysgenesis which can result in various presentations of one or more accessory thyroid glands these can be asymptomatic as of early 2015 in the united states new guidelines for tsh levels have been implemented as endorsed by the american association of clinical endocrinologists the new range is a tsh of 045 to 412  listed below are some of the effects of drugs on thyroid function  reduced serum concentration  increased serum concentration  non change tsh thyroidstimulating hormone t3 total triiodothyronine t4 total thyroxine ft4 free thyroxine ft3 free triiodothyronine rt3 reverse triiodothyronine in areas of the world where iodine is lacking in the diet the thyroid gland can become considerably enlarged a condition called endemic goiter pregnant women on a diet that is severely deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency congenital hypothyroidism manifesting in problems of physical growth and development as well as brain development a condition referred to as endemic cretinism in many developed countries newborns are routinely tested for congenital hypothyroidism as part of newborn screening children with congenital hypothyroidism are treated supplementally with levothyroxine which facilitates normal growth and development thyroxine is critical to the regulation of metabolism and growth throughout the animal kingdom among amphibians for example administering a thyroidblocking agent such as propylthiouracil ptu can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs in contrast administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis in amphibian metamorphosis thyroxine and iodine also exert a wellstudied experimental model of apoptosis on the cells of gills tail and fins of tadpoles iodine via iodolipids has favored the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely played a crucial role in the evolution of the human brain iodine and t4 trigger the amphibian metamorphosis that transforms the vegetarian aquatic tadpole into a carnivorous terrestrial adult frog with better neurological visuospatial olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting as seen in other predatory animals a similar phenomenon happens in the neotenic amphibian salamanders which without introducing iodine dont transform into terrestrial adults and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic axolotl   because the thyroid concentrates iodine it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission in the event of large accidental releases of such material into the environment the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can in theory be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of nonradioactive iodine taken in the form of potassium iodide tablets one consequence of the chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident  the use of iodised salt is an efficient way to add iodine to the diet it has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries and some governments have made the iodination of flour cooking oil and salt mandatory potassium iodide and sodium iodide are typically used forms of supplemental iodine as with most substances either too much or too little can cause problems recent studies on some populations are showing that excess iodine intake could cause an increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease resulting in permanent hypothyroidism  historical references to what we now know as the thyroid gland arise early in medical history in ayurvedic system of medicinethe book susrut samhita written about 1500 bc mentions the disease goitre as galaganda along with its treatment in 1600 bc the chinese were using burnt sponge and seaweed for the treatment of goitres enlarged thyroid glands celsus first described a bronchoceole a tumour of the neck in 15 ad around this time pliny referred to epidemics of goitre in the alps and also mentioned the use of burnt seaweed in their treatment in the same way as the chinese had done 1600 years earlier in 150 ad galen an instrumental figure in the transition from ancient to modern medicine referred to spongia usta burnt sponge for the treatment of goitre he also suggested incorrectly as it turns out that the role of the thyroid was to lubricate the larynx there are several findings that evidence a great interest for thyroid disorders just in the medieval medical school of salerno 12th century rogerius salernitanus the salernitan surgeon and author of post mundi fabricam around 1180 was considered at that time the surgical text par excellence all over europe in the chapter de bocio of his magnum opus he describes several pharmacological and surgical cures some of which nowadays are reappraised as scientifically effective  it was not until 1475 that wang hei anatomically described the thyroid gland and recommended that the treatment of goitre should be dried thyroid paracelsus some fifty years later attributed goitre to mineral impurities in the water in modern times the thyroid was first identified in 1656 by the anatomist thomas wharton whose name is also eponymised in whartons duct of the submandibular gland  in 1656 thomas wharton named the gland the thyroid meaning shield as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in ancient greece in 1909 theodor kocher from switzerland won the nobel prize in medicine for his work on the physiology pathology and surgery of the thyroid gland  the thyroid gland is found in all vertebrates in fish it is usually located below the gills and is not always divided into distinct lobes however in some teleosts patches of thyroid tissue are found elsewhere in the body associated with the kidneys spleen heart or eyes  in tetrapods the thyroid is always found somewhere in the neck region in most tetrapod species there are two paired thyroid glands  that is the right and left lobes are not joined together however there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most mammals and the shape found in humans is common to many other species  in larval lampreys the thyroid originates as an exocrine gland secreting its hormones into the gut and associated with the larvas filterfeeding apparatus in the adult lamprey the gland separates from the gut and becomes endocrine but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid for instance the closest living relatives of vertebrates the tunicates and amphioxus have a structure very similar to that of larval lampreys the endostyle and this also secretes iodinecontaining compounds albeit not thyroxine  the english name thyroid gland  is derived from latin glandula thyreoidea  glandula means gland in latin  and thyreoidea can be traced back to the ancient greek word \u03b8\u03c5\u03c1\u03b5\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c2 meaning shieldlikeshieldshaped  thyroid and parathyroid clearly visible pyramidal

V the aftonbladetisrael controversy refers to the controversy that followed the publication of a 17 august 2009 article in the swedish tabloid aftonbladet alleging that israeli troops harvested organs from palestinians that died in their custody the article sparked a fierce debate in sweden and abroad and created a rift between the swedish and israeli governments   israeli officials denounced the report at the time labeling it antisemitic the article was written by swedish freelance  photojournalist donald boström and was entitled våra söner plundras på sina organ our sons are being plundered for their organs it presented allegations that in the late 1980s and early 1990s many young men from the west bank and gaza strip had been seized by israeli forces and their bodies returned to their families with organs missing the israeli government and several us congresspersons   condemned the article as baseless and incendiary while noting the history of antisemitism and blood libels against jews and asked the swedish government to denounce it stockholm refused citing freedom of the press and the countrys constitution swedish ambassador to israel elisabet borsiin bonnier condemned the article as shocking and appalling stating that freedom of the press carries responsibility but the swedish government distanced itself from her remarks  the swedish newspaper publishers association and reporters without borders supported swedens refusal to condemn it the former warned of venturing onto a slope with government officials damning occurrences in swedish media something that may curb warranted debate and restrain freedom of expression through selfcensorship  italy made a stillborn attempt to defuse the diplomatic situation through a european resolution condemning antisemitism  the palestinian authority announced it would establish a commission to investigate the articles claims   a survey among the cultural editors of the other major swedish newspapers found that all would have refused the article as it at that time was based on outmoded hearsay and rumors  in december 2009 a 2000 interview with the chief pathologist at the l greenberg national institute of forensic medicine yehuda hiss was released in which he had admitted taking organs from the corpses of israeli soldiers israeli citizens palestinians and foreign workers without the families permission israeli health officials confirmed hiss confession but stated that such incidents had ended in the 1990s and noted that hiss had been removed from his post    the palestinian press claimed the report appeared to confirm palestinians allegations that israel returned their relatives bodies with their chests sewn up having harvested their organs  several news agencies reported that the aftonbladet article had claimed that israel killed palestinians to harvest their organs  although the author the culture editor for aftonbladet and nancy scheperhughes denied that it had made this claim    in august 2009 aftonbladet ran an article by freelance writer donald boström in its culture section the article opened by mentioning the arrests related to a suspected money laundering and organ trafficking operation involving rabbis politicians and civil servants in new jersey and new york briefly introducing the problem of the illegal organ trade worldwide boström then related things he heard and saw during his stay in the palestinian territories in 1992 during the first intifada  a photograph accompanying the article depicted a cadaver with a line of stitches on the torso identified as that of bilal ghanem 19 years old when he was killed by idf soldiers on 13 may 1992  the ghanem family was not interviewed for his article but boström described his impressions of ghanems burial which he attended together with the sharp noises from the shovels we could hear occasional laughter from the soldiers who as they waited to go home exchanged some jokes as bilal was put in the grave his chest was uncovered and suddenly it became clear to the few people present just what kind of abuse he had been exposed to bilal was not by far the first to be buried with a slit from his abdomen up to his chin and speculations on the intent started  the next paragraph of the article quotes other palestinian families and reads as follows the affected palestinian families in the west bank and gaza were sure of what happened to their sons our sons are used as involuntary organ donors relatives of khaled from nablus told me as did the mother of raed from jenin and the uncles of machmod and nafes from gaza who had all disappeared for a number of days only to return at night dead and autopsied boström also writes that unnamed un staff members told him that organ theft definitely occurred but that they were prevented from doing anything about it  he also reports the response of the idf spokesperson as being that the allegations of organ theft were lies and that all palestinian victims are subjected to autopsy on a routine basis boström notes that according to palestinian statistics for 1992 bilal ghanem was one of 133 palestinians killed and one of 69 who went through postmortem examination he concludes the article with his opinion that the questions surrounding what is happening remain unanswered and should be investigated  meanwhile family members of bilal ghanem the palestinian at the center of the articles allegations stated that they had never told boström that ghanems organs had been removed however even though they never spoke to boström and lacked any proof to confirm the allegations they thought bilal had been deprived of some organs   in a followup editorial aftonbladet editor jan helin wrote that he approved the article for publication because it raises a few questions while acknowledging that the paper at that time had no evidence for its claims  in august 2009 boström said he did not know whether the claims were true or not but that he wanted them investigated  he made similar remarks again at a november conference in israel  aftonbladet published an update noting the recent conviction of yehuda hiss chief pathologist at israels abu kabir institute and two of his colleagues for improperly taking body tissue from a dead israeli soldier in 2001 the paper acknowledged that the event did not prove the truth of the original allegations    the claim in the article sparked an angry reaction by israeli foreign ministry official yigal palmor who associated the article with medieval and 19th century blood libels  on 23 august the israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu called for the swedish government to condemn the article an israeli official quoted him as saying were not asking the swedish government for an apology were asking for their condemnation the israeli finance minister yuval steinitz said that a continued swedish refusal to condemn the article might lead israel to cancel a visit scheduled for september by the swedish foreign minister carl bildt steinitz told the israel army radio that whoever doesnt distance himself from this kind of blood libel might not be a welcome guest in israel at this time until the swedish government understands differently the state of israel the state of the jews cannot ignore antisemitic expressions and modern recycling of medieval antisemitism the israeli government press office which accredits foreign journalists visiting the country said it was delaying its approval for an aftonbladet correspondent and photographer who are seeking permission to enter the gaza strip by the maximum ninety days allowed by regulations  netanyahu said that history was replete with blood libel against jews that have led to murder and that these matters cannot be taken lightly we are not asking from the swedes anything that we did not ask of ourselves he reminded his ministers that in february 2009 after a satirical skit on the israeli channel 10 which poked fun at the christian belief that jesus walked on water and mary was a virgin had angered the vatican thenprime minister ehud olmert expressed regret and sorrow for it netanyahu commented i dont recall that olmerts condemnation damaged press freedom in israel the israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman told army radio that what angers us is that the swedish government didnt condemn it but hastened to reprimand the ambassador who did find it right to condemn the story which lieberman compared to historic antisemitic tracts  he accused sweden of hypocrisy saying that the affair has an odor of antisemitism  lieberman noted the swedish condemnation of the muhammed cartoons affair in 2005 as well as swedens shutting down of an internet site in the country that posted the caricatures and the swedish foreign ministers letter of apology to the president of yemen for this he criticized sweden for its silence earlier in 2009 when the city of malmö decided not to allow spectators to a davis cup match between sweden and israel  the israeli interior minister eli yishai said that he would act to prevent aftonbladets reporters from receiving work permits in israel and the welfare and social services minister isaac herzog said that israel should take legal steps against the paper when asked why israel did not investigate the articles claims israels envoy to sweden benny dagan said why dont we investigate why the mossad and the jews were behind the bombing of the twin towers why wont we investigate why jews are spreading aids in the arab countries why wont we investigate why jews killed christian children and took their blood and organs to bake matzot on pessah  on 23 december 2009 after israeli government officials admitted that organ harvesting had taken place in the 1990s parliamentary hearings into the issue began in israels knesset health officials testified that israeli authorities harvested organs from the dead bodies of israelis and palestinians in the 1990s for transplant purposes and said the practice had since been ended ahmed tibi an arab citizen of israel and member of the knesset testified that he had evidence indicating that organ theft continued citing the case of fadul ordul shaheen a palestinian from gaza who died of diabetes in 2009 tibi related that after shaheens body was returned to his family with bleeding from the eyes and a deep cut through the body the family said that both the corneas and kidneys were taken from his corpse tibi asked that the complaint be investigated and also asked that the government probe whether organs were being harvested from palestinian prisoners in israel yaacov litzman the deputy health minister responded that he would investigate the case with all seriousness  gideon levy writing in haaretz criticized the article and the israeli response saying that the article damaged the fight against the occupation levy criticized boström for not engaging in documentation investigation and the presentation of proof he noted that there were cases in which the organs of palestinians who had been killed were harvested without permission something the abu kabir institute of forensic medicine has done to others in israel for research purposes but its a long way from that to suspicion of trafficking in organs based only on the fact that in 1992 a dead palestinian was found whose organs had been removed and his body sewn back up and 17 years later a few jews were arrested on suspicion of trafficking in human organs thats not professional journalism thats cheap and harmful journalism however he called liebermans response ludicrous and stated that it had done diplomatic damage to israel  the editorial line of haaretz was much harsher saying that donald bostrom a veteran swedish journalist wrote a despicable utterly baseless article  it stated however that avigdor liebermans reaction was no less outrageous or inciting than bostroms article commenting that liebermans impassioned and demagogic reaction has damaged israel it cheapened the holocaust blew the article out of proportion and caused an international uproar pushing sweden  which currently holds the presidency of the european union  into an unnecessary confrontation with israel  maariv published an article reporting that much of boströms story came from his book inshallah 2001 which it states was financed in part by the swedish foreign ministry   yoram peri head of the chaim herzog institute for media politics and society at tel aviv university said the report touched a raw nerve among israelis  who harbor deep distrust towards europe believing the continents newspapers have a propalestinian tilt while agreeing on the lack of merit in the article he suggests politicians blew the controversy out of proportion for political purposes lieberman expressed the feeling of many israelis who do not understand the european narrative and they think that any criticism comes from total misunderstanding of the middle east or because europe is totally antisemitic and propalestinian very few politicians unfortunately are sophisticated enough to distinguish between legitimate criticism and attacks by those with other motives  former diplomat colette avital said that sweden should know that there is a difference between freedom of the press and freedom of opinion stating that freedom of expression is not unlimited even in that beautiful northern country she also criticized israeli official and media reactions as blown out of all reasonable proportion she criticized the israeli foreign minister for voicing ridiculous and ultimately harmful threats that the swedish ministers visit might be canceled or that swedish journalists will be refused entry into the country  a support meeting of families of israeli and palestinian organ and tissue donors on 26 aug at sourasky medical center in tel aviv discussed the newspaper report participants stressed a message that organ donation is saving lives without any conditions and called the report black propaganda against israel  elisabet borsiin bonnier the swedish ambassador to israel strongly condemned the article stating the article in the swedish newspaper is shocking and terrifying for us swedes as it influences the israeli citizens the embassy can not emphasize more its disgust  the swedish foreign ministry and the swedish foreign minister carl bildt distanced themselves from the ambassadors statement and underlined that sweden is a democracy with freedom of press and that state representatives should not comment on individual articles in newspapers  mårten schultz senior lecturer in jurisprudence thought that the appeals to freedom of speech were attempts to use the rhetorically convincing status of the freedom of expression and press legislation in order to pursue a political agenda and exhorted politicians and journalists to bring out and read the freedom of the press act before they say what the government is not entitled to do  the office of the chancellor of justice said that although the government can not criticize the decision to publish it might go further in its criticism of the article without violating the constitution although that might be inappropriate the literal words by the chancellor of justice göran lambertz were according to the swedish news agency tidningarnas telegrambyrå it is not completely clear where the limits are there is rather a lot one may do according to the constitution even if it were to be regarded as politically and legally inappropriate  on 6 september 2009 swedish foreign minister carl bildt announced the cancellation of a trip he planned to make to israel 11 september there was some speculation in israel and elsewhere that this was related to the aftonbladet controversy  however swedish officials denied this  the swedish chancellor of justice the sole attorney in enforcing violations to the conventions regarding freedom of the press and freedom of expression and the ombudsman on supervising government action have received two written requests asking for investigation into the matter  the first asked the chancellor to judge whether the article really would include anything that brings it beyond what the freedom of press allows  for example constitute hate speech the second asked him to open an errand of supervision regarding the swedish ambassadors statements and on a principal level explain what an ambassador officially can express on behalf of the high office and the country  aftonbladet was acquitted of all charges  nils funcke a swedish journalist and author focusing on the swedish constitution predicted that the swedish ambassador to israel would be criticized for her initiative the question he said is how sharp the criticism will be and how the government reacts despite his deep concerns regarding the quality of journalism in the article he called it unthinkable that the chancellors office would take legal action regarding its contents  the author of the article donald boström spoke to israel radio on 19 august 2009 and said he was worried by the allegations he reported it concerns me to the extent that i want it to be investigated thats true but whether its true or not  i have no idea i have no clue  boström told cnn that the purpose of his article was to call for an investigation into the claims about stealing organs in the early 1990s  in an interview to the arab media site menassat boström said there was no conclusive evidence that organ harvesting was a systematic idf practice but that there is a collection of allegations and suspicious circumstances he was quoted as saying the point is that we know there is organ trafficking in israel and we also know that there are families claiming that their childrens organs have been harvested these two facts together point to the need for further investigation aftonbladets editor jan helin said in response to the accusations im not a nazi im not antisemitic and described himself as a responsible editor who gave the green light to an article because it raises a few questions but noted however that aftonbladet had no evidence that israel practiced organ harvesting aftonbladet published a followup to boströms article which defended his report and said that the organharvesting allegation should be investigated either to stop the relentless palestinian rumors or if the rumors prove to be true stop the trade in body parts it called bonniers condemnation of the original article a disgrace  boström told israeli newspaper yediot aharonot i am not an antisemite and thats what saddens me most in this whole story ive been a journalist for 25 years and ive always written against racism and segregation he said that he had not meant to imply that idf soldiers were killing palestinians for their organs and that even the palestinians dont say that what they said is that when the israeli army returned the bodies 62 of them had been autopsied and 20 palestinian families i spoke to were certain that their sons organs had been harvested he acknowledged he had not personally seen evidence of organ harvesting since the bodies that were returned to the families were never examined to determine whether organs had been taken as far as i know no one examined the bodies all im saying is that this needs to be investigated he also said that sweden supports israel as a country and a people and i am a part of this there are many people i among them who condemn the israeli governments policy of occupation and violation of international law israel needs to withdraw to its borders and evacuate the settlements if israel does this support for you will reappear  the swedish rival newspaper sydsvenskan sharply criticized aftonbladet for publishing what it called an antisemitic conspiracy theory  henrik bredberg in sydsvenskan said donald boström publicised a variant of an antisemitic classic the jew who abducts children and steals their blood the regrettable aspects just seem to grow and grow the israeli government rages and speaks of an article which shames swedish democracy and the entire swedish press hardly freedom of expression and freedom of the press are part of democracy dare to believe in freedom of the press and open debate even when individual editors make stupid and tasteless decisions  a editorial in göteborgsposten the foreign ministry has made it clear that swedish freedom of the press applies good aftonbladet should not be given the unwarranted glory of martyrdom publication seems to represent an obvious lack of judgment unfortunately the lack of judgment did not stop there the swedish ambassador in tel aviv attacked the article and thereby created the impression that having views about or intervening in individual publications should be a task for the government and its representatives  several political commentators pointed out that sweden holds the presidency of the council of the european union at the time of this dispute from an israeli point of view they say discrediting sweden as antisemitic may be a way to prevent european criticism of israels middle east policies    lena posnerkörösi a leader of swedens jewish community criticized israels official response to boströms article stating in an interview with the israeli army radio that the israeli reaction and media outrage had provided the claims with much more exposure than they would have had otherwise and blown the story out of proportion  she noted how initial widespread condemnations of aftonbladet and its article in the swedish media quickly turned into united defence for freedom of the press when israel requested that the government should condemn it too posnerkörösi explained that freedom of expression is sacred to swedes and that no one understands how israel dares to interfere   posnerkörösi was nevertheless critical of aftonbladet stating in her letter to editor jan helin that the jewish central council in sweden insists that the description is akin to classic antisemitism  jews who kidnap children to slaughter them and steal their blood we are confounded how a swedish newspaper once again permits its pages to include such hate speech and expect that you as editor and publisher to reject antisemitic statements  anders carlberg the outgoing chairman of the jewish community in gothenburg sweden called israels response unhelpful he said israel should have responded by publishing a rebuttal the stance of the community in general is that its strange that this has become a government issue at all carlberg said it falls along the lines of voltaire i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to death your right to say it  on 3 sep 2009 the palestinian authority pa announced the formation of an interministerial panel to investigate allegations that the israeli military stole organs from palestinian detainees the secretary general of the pa council of ministers dr hassan abu libdeh said that if true the alleged events would constitute violations of human rights the pas ministers of health interior and foreign affairs and senior officials from each ministry would he said sit on the commission  according to the jerusalem post jalal ghanem the brother of bilal ghanem whose photograph accompanied boströms article could not confirm the allegations made by the aftonbladet jalal said that bilal was evacuated by the idf in a helicopter after being shot his corpse was delivered to the family a few days later and that there were stitches on bilals body that ran from the chest down to the bottom of the abdomen and that his teeth were missing jalal also said the only time the family saw the swedish photographer was at bilals funeral when he photographed the event  in subsequent interview with aljazeera he added that he thought bilal was among those who had their organs stolen  their mother denied having told any foreign journalist that her sons organs had been stolen the jerusalem post reported in its article although she does not rule out the possibility that israel was harvesting organs of palestinians another relative of the family ibrahim ghanem said the family never told the swedish photographer that israel had stolen organs from bilals body and speculated that maybe the journalist reached that conclusion on the basis of the stitches he saw on the body he also said that the family doesnt have any evidence on whether the organs were removed because they never had their own autopsy conducted  in an interview with aftonbladet made one week after the original article jalal ghanem and bilals mother saadega ghanem still stood by their allegations and also claimed that bilal was still alive when he was taken away they also claimed that idf soldiers tried to prevent journalists from taking pictures of the body  palestinian journalist khalid amayreh reported in an article in alahram that prior accusations of organ harvesting had been made by representatives of the palestinian authority including by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat amayreh noted that no genuine investigation had ever been carried out into the palestinian allegations of unauthorized organ harvesting even though these allegations date back to before the 1990s  jonathan cook a british journalist covering the israelpalestine conflict noted that many western journalists had heard such rumors but none before boström had written about them according to cook  the families making the claims were not given a hearing in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the first intifada when most of the reports occurred and are still being denied the right to voice their concerns today israels sensitivity to the allegation of organ theft  appears to trump the genuine concerns of families about possible abuse of their loved ones  in an article for the scottish daily record british member of parliament george galloway asserted that israel was playing minimengele on palestinian prisoners in israeli jails a reference to the nazi physician josef mengele known as the angel of death  in september 2009 hundreds of palestinians attended a conference marking the national day for the return of the bodies of martyrs in nablus palestinian organizations say israel is holding the bodies of 275 palestinians and refusing to return them to their families following the conference mohammad barakeh a palestinian member of israels knesset made a connection between the missing bodies and the article in aftonbladet saying israel has maintained its reputation and alerted the entire world to the swedish article they claim that what was published there could not be true  the burden of proof falls on israel and as long as it refuses to say what the status of the bodies is or return them it is hiding something awful  the iranian state newspaper kayhan quoted arab reporter kusar aslam who claims to have been stationed in gaza and the west bank for 22 years as saying since the early 1970s the israelis have snatched thousands of palestinian bodies from hospitals in the territories and transferred them to the abu kabir forensic institute and that my personal experience verifies the report published by donald boström she said that the idf kidnapped living palestinians i personally witnessed israeli soldiers and army vehicles snatching palestinian bodies from emergency rooms in other instances i saw soldiers follow palestinians to cemeteries with the intent of stealing bodies before they were buried this became so widespread that many people began to bury those murdered by idf forces near their homes  in the yard or under a tree  syrian president bashar assads spokeswoman bouthaina shaaban praised boströms article in asharq alawsat and said israel should be put on trial for its criminal acts she claimed there was a connection between the violation of palestinian corpses claimed by boström and the accused israeliamerican organtrafficking ring whose members were indicted in new jersey and new york in july 2009  yossi levy the israeli foreign ministrys spokesman said shaabans praise for the article should be a warning light for the swedish government which unfortunately has still not fully and courageously condemned the article  in a letter to the swedish prime minister congressmen robert wexler dfl and elton gallegly rca members on the united states house foreign affairs subcommittee on europe wrote given the farreaching implications for this article which raises the unfortunate specter of similar blood libels and spurious charges that have been directed at jews throughout the centuries it is critical that your government unequivocally repudiate and reject the heinous allegations expressed in this article it is essential that this vitriolic article not be used by antisemites antiisrael advocates and extremists as an excuse to commit acts of violence and terrorism against the jewish community in sweden or internationally the letter stated   senator ben cardin dmd chairman of us helsinki commission released a press release that urged european foreign ministers to denounce the aftonbladet article he said we at the us helsinki commission are dedicated to upholding human rights particularly freedom of the press but with freedom of the press comes responsibility and when major press outlets fail to meet their responsibility and instead raise the specter of racism or antisemitism then public officials are duty bound to speak out and condemn such blatant falsehoods i commend swedens ambassador to israel for fulfilling this duty and i call on the swedish government which currently holds the european union presidency to support italian and other eu efforts to denounce this harmful reporting  cochairman of us helsinki commission us senator alcee hastings dfl said this incendiary article draws on age old antisemitic imagery and attempts to place it in a modern context of worrisome hostility in europe towards both jews and israel government leaders must demand the press act with journalistic integrity and report responsibly particularly when it can incite the violent potential of antisemitism and other forms of hatred  abraham h foxman the national director of the antidefamation league of bnai brith said the adl lodged a complaint with the swedish embassy in washington such unfounded rumors  of jews poisoning the wells and carrying out acts of ritual murderhave been in the playbook of antisemites through the centuries and continue to be believed in parts of the arab world and elsewhere to this day what could mr boström and the editors who ushered this article into print have been thinking the letter stated this article represents nothing less than a base recycling of the medieval blood libel in which jews were charged with killing christian children for their alleged ritual use   in a video  on their website time magazine quoted the 2009 swedish aftonbladets unbacked variant of the classic antisemitic blood libel accusation as fact and retracted   the allegations that israeli soldiers had harvested and sold palestinian organs in 2009 within hours on august 24 2014 after a denouncing report from honest reporting came out  the reporters without borders expressed regret that israel had gone after the swedish government for a condemnation regardless of the articles content and although we understand the public outcry it has triggered in israel the israeli authorities must refrain from asking their swedish counterparts to intervene they said aftonbladet alone is responsible for the articles it publishes the swedish government is not responsible  in an interview with haarez on 31 august the italian foreign minister franco frattini said that he had recently met with bildt and that the two of them agreed that at a meeting of european union foreign ministers later the following week they would work to pass a resolution making it clear that the eu under the swedish presidency strongly condemns antisemitism and will take action against any manifestation of it in europe frattini said he was intending to demand that the meetings summary statement explicitly condemn the article  later that day the swedish news agency tt quoted carl bildt as denying the frattinis conclusion and reported that the head of communications at the swedish foreign ministry cecilia julin denied that bildt and frattini even had discussed the dispute or a possible resolution at the council of ministers julin said from the swedish side we have no plans to handle this question through the informal foreign ministers meeting in stockholm according to her bildt suggested that frattinis comment must have arisen through an italian misunderstanding reinfeldt also insisted that the swedish government could not take a stand because of swedens freedom of the press at a press conference in stockholm he said we cannot be asked by anyone to contravene the swedish constitution and this is something we will also not do within the european union  the israeli prime ministers office did not comment on frattinis initiative however palmor said every initiative against antisemitism is welcome but if the declaration is general and does not specifically relate to the article in aftonbladet it will not resolve anything he added that we did not ask for an apology or for measures against the newspaper or the journalist all we asked of sweden and the swedes is that they reject and decry the content of the report and our position has not changed  in december 2009 nancy scheperhughes an anthropology professor at the university of california at berkeley and founder of a newsletter called organs watch released the tape of an interview she had conducted in 2000 with yehuda hiss then director of israels l greenberg institute of forensic medicine known colloquially as the abu kabir forensic institute in the interview which appeared on israels channel 2 television hiss stated that he had harvested organs in the 1990s we started to harvest corneas  whatever was done was highly informal no permission was asked from the family  hiss was fired from his position as director of the forensic institute in 2004 for repeated bodypart scandals  hiss was later reinstated and still retains the directors position  israeli officials acknowledged that incidents like that had taken place but stated that the vast majority of cases involved israeli citizens that no such incidents had occurred for a long time and that hiss had been removed from his position  scheperhughes stated that palestinians were not the only ones affected by a long shot but that she felt the interview must be made public now because the symbolism you know of taking skin of the population considered to be the enemy is something just in terms of its symbolic weight that has to be reconsidered  in an interview with al jazeera scheperhughes said the organ harvesting took place with the sanction and approval of the military establishment and that the body parts were used by hospitals for transplant purposes  cornea transplants they were sent to public hospitals for use on citizens and the skin went to a special skin bank founded by the military for their uses such as for burns victims

V a parietal eye also known as a third eye or pineal eye is a part of the epithalamus present in some animal species the eye is photoreceptive and is associated with the pineal gland regulating circadian rhythmicity and hormone production for thermoregulation    the lizardlike reptile tuatara has a welldeveloped parietal eye with small lens and retina   parietal eyes are also found in lizards frogs and lampreys as well as some species of fish such as tuna and pelagic sharks where it is visible as a lightsensitive spot on top of their head a poorly developed version often called the parapineal gland occurs in salamanders and in fish such as zebrafish in extant birds and mammals the parietal organ but not the pineal gland is absent the parietal eye is a part of the epithalamus which can be divided into two major parts the epiphysis the pineal organ or pineal gland if mostly endocrine and the parietal organ often called the parietal eye or third eye if it is photoreceptive it arises as an anterior evagination of the pineal organ or as a separate outgrowth of the roof of the diencephalon in some species it protrudes through the skull  the parietal eye uses a different biochemical method of detecting light than rod cells or cone cells in a normal vertebrate eye  many of the oldest fossil vertebrates including ostracoderms placoderms crossopterygians and even early tetrapods had a socket in the skull that appears to have held a functional third eye this socket remains as a foramen between the parietal bones even in many living amphibians and reptiles although it has vanished in birds and mammals the third eye where present is always much smaller than the main paired eyes and in living species it is always covered by skin and is usually not readily visible externally  among fish lampreys retain two functional third eyes one developed from the parietal gland and the other from the pineal gland these are one behind the other in the centre of the upper surface of the braincase because lampreys are among the most primitive of all living vertebrates it is possible that this was the original condition among vertebrates and may have allowed bottomdwelling species to sense threats from above  as shown in the accompanying figures the parietal eye of amphibians and reptiles appears relatively far forward in the skull thus it may be surprising that the human pineal gland appears far away from this position tucked away between the corpus callosum and cerebellum also the parietal bones in humans make up a portion of the rear of the skull far from the eyes to understand this note that the parietal bones formed a part of the skull lying between the eyes in sarcopterygians and basal amphibians but have moved further back in higher vertebrates  likewise in the brain of the frog the diencephalon from which the pineal stalk arises appears relatively further forward as the cerebral hemispheres are smaller but the optic lobes are far more prominent than the human mesencephalon which is part of the brain stem  in humans the optic tract commissure and optic nerve bridge the substantial distance between eyes and diencephalon likewise the pineal stalk of petromyzon elongates very considerably during metamorphosis  crustaceans have a single eye atop of the head as a nauplius first stage larva this eye has a lens and senses direction of light but cannot see images later more sophisticated segmented eyes develop on sides of the head but the initial eye stays for some time hence it is possible to say that at some stage of development crustaceans have the third eye as well some species like artemia salina the brine shrimp retain the primary eye being threeeyed in the adult stage many arthropods have simple eyes frequently between the main eyes called ocelli

V enterochromaffinlike cells or ecl cells are a type of neuroendocrine cells found in the gastric glands of the gastric mucosa beneath the epithelium in particular in the vicinity of parietal cells that aid in the production of gastric acid via the release of histamine they are also considered a type of enteroendocrine cell    ecl cells synthesize and secrete histamine these cells are stimulated by the hormones gastrin and pituitary adenylyl cyclaseactivating peptide g cells are stimulated by vagal stimulation through the neurotransmitter gastrinreleasing peptide this causes the g cells to secrete gastrin which in turn stimulates ecl cells to release histamine note that this circuit is not activated by acetylcholine which is of particular importance because the administration of atropine will not block the vagal stimulation of the g cells as ach is not the neurotransmitter for these cells however ecl cells are activated directly by ach on m1 receptors from direct vagal innervation leading to histamine release this pathway will be inhibited by atropine  gastrin is transferred from a specific type of g cell in the gastric epithelium to the ecl cells by blood histamine and gastrin act synergistically as the most important stimulators of hydrochloric acid secretion from parietal cells and stimulators of secretion of pepsinogen from chief cells the most important inhibitor of the ecl cell is somatostatin from oxyntic d cells enterochromaffinlike cells also produce pancreastatin and probably other peptide hormones and growth factors a prolonged stimulation of these cells causes their hyperplasia this is especially important in gastrinoma the tumors in which there is an excessive secretion of gastrin as this is one of the factors contributing to zollingerellisons syndrome it was once believed that tumors of ecl origin form after a prolonged inhibition of gastric acid secretion however there is no data to support this conclusion and proton pump inhibitors are not thought to contribute to gastric cancer the name is derived from their location in the enteric system and their chromaffinlike staining pattern in histologic sections which is characterized by silver staining

V the prostate from greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 prostates literally one who stands before protector guardian  is a compound tubuloalveolar exocrine gland of the male reproductive system in most mammals   it differs considerably among species anatomically chemically and physiologically the function of the prostate is to secrete a slightly alkaline fluid milky or white in appearance that in humans usually constitutes roughly 30 of the volume of the semen along with spermatozoa and seminal vesicle fluid  semen is made alkaline overall with the secretions from the other contributing glands including at least the seminal vesicle fluid  the alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the acidity of the vaginal tract prolonging the lifespan of sperm the prostatic fluid is expelled in the first ejaculate fractions together with most of the spermatozoa in comparison with the few spermatozoa expelled together with mainly seminal vesicular fluid those expelled in prostatic fluid have better motility longer survival and better protection of the genetic material the prostate also contains some smooth muscles that help expel semen during ejaculation   a healthy human male prostate is classically said to be slightly larger than a walnut the mean weight of the normal prostate in adult males is about 11grams usually ranging between 7 and 16grams  a study stated that prostate volume among patients with negative biopsy is related significantly with weight and height body mass index so it is necessary to control for weight  the prostate surrounds the urethra just below the urinary bladder and can be felt during a rectal exam the secretory epithelium is mainly pseudostratified comprising tall columnar cells and basal cells which are supported by a fibroelastic stroma containing randomly oriented smooth muscle bundles thats continuous with the bladder the epithelium is highly variable and areas of low cuboidal or squamous epithelium are also present with transitional epithelium in the distal regions of the longer ducts  within the prostate the urethra coming from the bladder is called the prostatic urethra and merges with the two ejaculatory ducts  the prostate can be divided in two ways by zone or by lobe  it does not have a capsule rather an integral fibromuscular band surrounds it  it is sheathed in the muscles of the pelvic floor which contract during the ejaculatory process the zone classification is more often used in pathology the idea of zones was first proposed by mcneal in 1968 mcneal found that the relatively homogeneous cut surface of an adult prostate in no way resembled lobes and thus led to the description of zones  the prostate gland has four distinct glandular regions two of which arise from different segments of the prostatic urethra the lobe classification is more often used in anatomy the prostatic part of the urethra develops from the pelvic middle part of the urogenital sinus endodermal origin endodermal outgrowths arise from the prostatic part of the urethra and grow into the surrounding mesenchyme the glandular epithelium of the prostate differentiates from these endodermal cells and the associated mesenchyme differentiates into the dense stroma and the smooth muscle of the prostate  the prostate glands represent the modified wall of the proximal portion of the male urethra and arises by the 9th week of embryonic life in the development of the reproductive system condensation of mesenchyme urethra and wolffian ducts gives rise to the adult prostate gland a composite organ made up of several glandular and nonglandular components tightly fused during male ejaculation sperm is transmitted from the ductus deferens into the male urethra via the ejaculatory ducts which lie within the prostate gland it is possible for men to achieve orgasm solely through stimulation of the prostate gland such as prostate massage or receptive anal intercourse    prostatic secretions vary among species they are generally composed of simple sugars and are often slightly alkaline  in human prostatic secretions the protein content is less than 1 and includes proteolytic enzymes prostatic acid phosphatase betamicroseminoprotein and prostatespecific antigen the secretions also contain zinc with a concentration 5001000 times the concentration in blood to function properly the prostate needs male hormones androgens which are responsible for male sex characteristics the main male hormone is testosterone which is produced mainly by the testicles it is dihydrotestosterone dht a metabolite of testosterone that predominantly regulates the prostate prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland there are primarily four different forms of prostatitis each with different causes and outcomes two relatively uncommon forms acute prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis are treated with antibiotics category i and ii respectively chronic nonbacterial prostatitis or male chronic pelvic pain syndrome category iii which comprises about 95 of prostatitis diagnoses is treated by a large variety of modalities including alpha blockers phytotherapy  physical therapy  psychotherapy antihistamines anxiolytics nerve modulators surgery and more more recently a combination of trigger point and psychological therapy has proved effective for category iii prostatitis as well  category iv prostatitis relatively uncommon in the general population is a type of leukocytosis benign prostatic hyperplasia bph occurs in older men  the prostate often enlarges to the point where urination becomes difficult symptoms include needing to urinate often frequency or taking a while to get started hesitancy if the prostate grows too large it may constrict the urethra and impede the flow of urine making urination difficult and painful and in extreme cases completely impossible bph can be treated with medication a minimally invasive procedure or in extreme cases surgery that removes the prostate minimally invasive procedures include transurethral needle ablation of the prostate tuna and transurethral microwave thermotherapy tumt  these outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary prostatic stent to allow normal voluntary urination without exacerbating irritative symptoms  the surgery most often used in such cases is called transurethral resection of the prostate turp or tur in turp an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate tissue that is pressing against the upper part of the urethra and restricting the flow of urine turp results in the removal of mostly transitional zone tissue in a patient with bph older men often have corpora amylacea  amyloid dense accumulations of calcified proteinaceous material in the ducts of their prostates the corpora amylacea may obstruct the lumens of the prostatic ducts and may underlie some cases of bph urinary frequency due to bladder spasm common in older men may be confused with prostatic hyperplasia statistical observations suggest that a diet low in fat and red meat and high in protein and vegetables as well as regular alcohol consumption could protect against bph  lifestyle changes to improve the quality of urination include urinating in the sitting position  this reduces the amount of residual volume in the bladder increases the urinary flow rate and decreases the voiding time prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting older men in developed countries and a significant cause of death for elderly men estimated by some specialists at 3  despite this the american cancer societys position regarding early detection is research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment they believe that men should not be tested without learning about the risks and possible benefits of testing and treatment which should be discussed with a doctor at age 50 or at age 45 if the patient is black or has a father or brother who acquired prostate cancer before age 65  if checks are performed they can be in the form of a physical rectal exam measurement of prostate specific antigen psa level in the blood or checking for the presence of the protein engrailed2 en2 in the urine coresearchers hardev pandha and richard morgan published their findings regarding checking for en2 in urine in the 1 march 2011 issue of the journal clinical cancer research  a laboratory test currently identifies en2 in urine and a home test kit is envisioned similar to a home pregnancy test strip according to morgan we are preparing several large studies in the uk and in the us and although the en2 test is not yet available several companies have expressed interest in taking it forward  in 1983 the journal of the american medical association reported a connection between vasectomy and an increased risk of prostate cancer reported studies of 48000 and 29000 men who had vasectomies showed 66 percent and 56 percent higher rates of prostate cancer respectively the risk increased with age and the number of years since the vasectomy was performed however in march of the same year the national institute of child health and human development held a conference cosponsored by the national cancer institute and others to review the available data and information on the link between prostate cancer and vasectomies it was determined that an association between the two was very weak at best and even if having a vasectomy increased ones risk the risk was relatively small in 1997 the nci held a conference with the prostate cancer progressive review group a committee of scientists medical personnel and others their final report published in 1998 stated that evidence that vasectomies help to develop prostate cancer was weak at best  skenes gland also known as the paraurethral gland found in females is homologous to the prostate gland in males however anatomically the uterus is in the same position as the prostate gland in 2002 skenes gland was officially renamed to female prostate by the federative international committee on anatomical terminology  the female prostate like the male prostate secretes psa and levels of this antigen rise in the presence of carcinoma of the gland the gland also expels fluid like the male prostate during orgasm  the prostate is found as a male accessory gland in all placental mammals excepting edentates martens badgers and otters  the prostate glands of male marsupials are proportionally larger than those of placental mammals  the structure of the prostate varies ranging from tubuloalveolar as in humans to branched tubular the gland is particularly well developed in dogs foxes and boars though in other mammals such as bulls it can be small and inconspicuous   dogs can produce in one hour as much prostatic fluid as a human can in a day they excrete this fluid along with their urine to mark territory  in many rodents and bats the prostatic fluid contains a coagulant this mixes with and coagulates semen during copulation to form a mating plug that temporarily prevents further copulation   the prostate gland originates with tissues in the urethral wall this means the urethra a compressible tube used for urination runs through the middle of the prostate this leads to an evolutionary design fault for some mammals including human males the prostate is prone to infection and enlargement later in life constricting the urethra so urinating becomes slow and painful  skenes gland is found in both female humans and rodents historically it was thought to be a vestigial organ but recently it has been discovered that it produces the same protein markers psa and pab as the male prostate  this means skenes gland functions as a female prostate a histologic homolog to the male prostate gland   notes sources

V the esophagus american english or oesophagus british english commonly known as the foodpipe or gullet is an organ in vertebrates which consists of a fibromuscular tube through which food passes aided by peristaltic contractions from the pharynx to the stomach in humans the esophagus is usually 1825centimeters cm long during swallowing the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx the esophagus travels behind the trachea and heart passes through the diaphragm and empties into the cardia of the stomach the word esophagus derives from the greek word oisophagos which means to carry to eat  the wall of the esophagus from the lumen outwards consists of mucosa submucosa connective tissue layers of muscle fibers between layers of fibrous tissue and an outer layer of connective tissue the mucosa is a stratified squamous epithelium multiple layers of cells topped by a layer of flat cells which contrasts to the single layer of columnar cells of the stomach the transition between these two type of epithelium is visible as a zigzag line most of the muscle is smooth muscle although striated muscle predominates in its upper two thirds it has two muscular rings or sphincters in its wall one at the top and one at the bottom the lower sphincter helps to prevent reflux of acidic stomach content the esophagus has a rich blood supply and vascular drainage its smooth muscle is innervated by involuntary nerves sympathetic nerves via the sympathetic trunk and parasympathetic nerves via the vagus nerve and in addition voluntary nerves lower motor neurons are carried in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle the esophagus may be affected by gastric reflux cancer prominent dilated blood vessels called varices that can bleed heavily tears constrictions and disorders of motility clinical investigations include xrays using barium endoscopy and ct scans the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system at the mouth opening it is continuous with the back of the oral cavity passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum through the diaphragm and into the stomach in humans the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra c6 behind the cricoid cartilage enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra t10 and ends at the cardia of the stomach at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra t11  the esophagus is usually about 25cm 10in in length  many blood vessels serve the esophagus with blood supply varying along its course the cervical parts of the esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from inferior thyroid artery the parts of the esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter les receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery   the venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus the upper and lower parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins and blood from the middle part drains into the left gastric vein all these veins drain into the superior vena cava with the exception of the left gastric vein which is a branch of the portal vein  lymphatically the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodesthis is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal foregut structure which all drain into the celiac nodes  the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk  the vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function supplying the muscles of the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction two sets of nerve fibres travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles the upper striated muscle and upper esophageal sphincter are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus whereas fibres that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus  the vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis  the sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function it may enhance the function of the vagus nerve increasing peristalsis and glandular activity and causing sphincter contraction in addition sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction  sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk  the upper esophagus lies at the back of the mediastinum behind the trachea and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column the lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of thoracic aorta from the bifurcation of the trachea downwards the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery left main bronchus and left atrium at this point it passes through the diaphragm  the thoracic duct which drains the majority of the bodys lymph passes behind the esophagus curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in the lower part of the esophagus to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus the esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side the vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus  the esophagus has four points of constriction when corrosive substances are ingested or a solid object is swallowed it is most likely to lodge and damage these four points these constrictions are because of particular structures that compress on the esophagus these constrictions are  the esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter  these sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed the esophageal sphincters are functional but not anatomical sphincters meaning that they are sections of the esophageal wall that act as a sphincter but do not have distinct thickenings like other sphincters  the upper esophageal sphincter surrounds the upper part of the esophagus it consists of skeletal muscle but is not under conscious control opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallow reflex the primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeus portion of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor  the lower esophageal sphincter surrounds the lower part of the esophagus this sphincter surrounds the junction between the esophagus and the stomach  the gastroesophageal junction also known at the esophagogastic junction is the junction between the esophagus and the stomach and it is situated at the lower end of the esophagus  the pink color of the esophageal mucosa contrasts to the a deeper red of the gastric mucosa   and the mucosal transition can be seen as an irregular zigzag line which is often called the zline  similarly by direct vision of fresh specimens greypink of the esophageal mucosa contrasts with the darker gastric mucosa  but in embalmed cadavers a color contrast may not be apparent  histological examination reveals abrupt transition between the nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach  normally the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the zline  and the zline coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia however when the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in barrets esophagus the true gastroeshophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition  the functional location of les is generally situated about 3cm distal to the zline  the human esophagus has a mucosa consisting of a tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin a smooth lamina propria and a muscularis mucosa  the epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food in many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin representing a coarser diet  protection is conferred by the secretion of mucus from glands  there are two types of glands with mucussecreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa and esophageal cardiac glands similar to cardiac glands of the stomach located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ   the submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus a network of nerve cells part of the enteric nervous system  the muscularis propria of the esophagus has two types of muscle the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle and the lower third contain smooth muscle with the middle third containing a mixture of both  muscle is arranged in two layers one in which the muscle fibres run longitudinal to the esophagus and the other in which the fibres encircle the esophagus these are separated by the myenteric plexus a tangled interpolation of nerve fibres involved in the secretion of mucus and peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus the esophagus also has an adventitia but not a serosa this makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract  the esophagus develops from the embryonic gut tube an endodermal structure early in development the human embryo has three layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac during the second week of embryological development as the embryo grows it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac the enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract such as the esophagus stomach and intestines  the sac is surrounded by a network of arteries called the vitelline plexus over time these arteries consolitate into three main arteries that supply the developing gastrointestinal tract the celiac artery superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery the areas supplied by these arteries are used to define the midgut hindgut and foregut  the esophagus develops as part of the foregut tube  the innervation of the esophagus develops from the branchial arches  in humans and other animals food is ingested through the mouth during swallowing food passes from the mouth through the pharynx into the esophagus the esophagus is thus one of the first components of the human digestive system and the human gastrointestinal tract after food passes through the esophagus it enters the stomach  when food is being swallowed the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx preventing food from entering the trachea at the same time the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes allowing a bolus of food to enter rhythmic contraction of the esophageal muscle called peristalsis pushes the food down the esophagus these rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself along with the peristalsis the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes  the stomach generates strong acids including hydrochloric acid hcl and enzymes to aid in food digestion this digestive mixture is called gastric juice constriction of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters help to prevent reflux of gastric contents and juices into the esophagus protecting the esophageal mucosa in addition the acute angle of his and the lower crura of the diaphragm helps this sphincteric action   the main conditions affecting the esophagus are described here for a more complete list see esophageal disease inflammation of the esophagus is known as esophagitis reflux of gastric acids from the stomach infection substances ingested for example corrosives some medications such as bisphosphonates food allergies and can all lead to esophagitis as of 2014  the cause of some forms of esophagitis such as eosinophilic esophagitis is not known esophagitis can cause painful swallowing and is usually treated by managing the cause of the esophagitis  such as managing reflux or treating infection  cancer of the esophagus may occur in two forms if the cancer occurs in the squamous cells lining the esophagus it is called a carcinoma such a cancer is more common in china and iran if the cancer occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the esophagus then the cancer is an adenocarcinoma this is most common in western countries in those with barretts esophagus and occurs in the cuboidal cells  in its early stages esophageal cancer may not have any symptoms at all when severe esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss the progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded how many lymph nodes possess the cancer and whether there are any metastases in different parts of the body esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy chemotherapy and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus inserting a stent into the esophagus or inserting a nasogastric tube may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water as of 2014  the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment  prolonged esophagitis particularly from gastric reflux is one factor thought to play a role in the development of barretts esophagus in this condition there is metaplasia of the lining of the lower esophagus which changes from stratified squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia barretts esophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of esophageal cancer  esophageal varices refer to engorged blood vessels present within the esophageal walls these blood vessels are engorged more than normal and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the esophagus these blood vessels develop as part of a collateral circulation that occurs to drain blood from the abdomen as a result of portal hypertension usually as a result of liver diseases such as cirrhosis   this collateral circulation occurs because the lower part of the esophagus drains into the left gastric vein which is a branch of the portal vein because of the extensive venous plexus that exists between this vein and other veins if portal hypertension occurs the direction of blood drainage in this vein may reverse with blood draining from the portal venous system through the plexus veins in the plexus may engorge and lead to varices   esophageal varices often do not have symptoms until they rupture a ruptured varix is considered a medical emergency because varices can bleed a lot a bleeding varix may cause a person to throw up blood or may cause symptoms of hypovolemic shock to deal with a ruptured varix a band may be placed around the bleeding bood vessel or a small amount of a clotting agent may be injected near the bleed a surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound a person with a bleeding varice may also receive iv fluids in order to prevent hypovolemic shock from excess blood loss  several disorders affect the motility of food as it travels down the esophagus this can cause difficult swallowing called dysphagia achalasia refers to a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly and generally develops later in life this leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus and possibly eventual megaesophagus a nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful and diffuse esophageal spasm refers to spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain sclerosis of the esophagus such as with systemic sclerosis or in crest syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis  various structures may also constrict the esophagus these esophageal strictures are usually benign and typically develop after a person has had reflux for many years other malformations may include esophageal webs which can also be congenital and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy corrosive ingestion or eosinophilic esophagitis a schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastroesophageal junction strictures may also develop in chronic anemia and plummervinson syndrome  the esophagus fails to develop or there is an abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus in about 1 in 3500 births conventional classification divides such connections into five types based on whether the esophagus is a continuous tube or not and which end of the esophagus proximal distal both or neither connects to the trachea about half the time these abnormalities occurs with additional abnormalities in other parts of the body especially affecting the heart  an xray of swallowed barium may be used to reveal the size and shape of the esophagus and the presence of any masses the esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus in a procedure called an endoscopy if an endoscopy is used on the stomach the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus during an endoscopy a biopsy may be taken if cancer of the esophagus is being investigated other methods including a ct scan may also be used  the word esophagus british english oesophagus comes from greek \u03bf\u1f30\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 oisophagos from to carry oesin and to eat phagos  the greek term oesophagus from which the english term has been derived has been documented in anatomical literature since at least the time of hippocrates who noted that the oesophagus receives the greatest amount of what we consume   its existence in other animals and its relationship with the stomach was documented by the ancient roman philosopher and physician pliny the elder  and the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus have been documented since at least the time of galen  the first attempt at surgery on the esophagus focused in the neck and was firstly conducted in dogs by theodore billroth in 1871 and then in people by czerny in 1877 by 1908 an operation had been performed by voeckler to remove the esophagus and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus to control esophageal cancer had been conducted  the nissen fundoplication in which the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter in order to stimulate its function and control reflux was first conducted by rudolph nissen in 1955  in tetrapods the pharynx is much shorter and the esophagus correspondingly longer than in fish in the majority of vertebrates the esophagus is simply a connecting tube but in some birds which regurgitate components to feed their young it is extended towards the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach   in ruminants animals with four stomachs a groove called the sulcus reticuli is often found in the esophagus allowing milk to drain directly into the hind stomach the abomasum  the esophagus of snakes is remarkable for the distension it undergoes when swallowing prey  in most fish the esophagus is extremely short primarily due to the length of the pharynx which is associated with the gills however some fish including lampreys chimaeras and lungfish have no true stomach so that the esophagus effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine and is therefore somewhat longer  in many vertebrates the esophagus is lined by stratified squamous epithelia without glands in fish the esophagus is often lined with columnar epithelia  and in amphibians sharks and rays the esophageal epithelium is ciliated helping to wash food along in addition to the action of muscular peristalsis  in addition in the bat plecotus auritus fish and some amphibians glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found  the muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is striated initially but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so in the canine and ruminants however it is entirely striated to allow regurgitation to feed young canines or regurgitation to chew cud ruminants it is entirely smooth muscle in amphibians reptiles and birds  contrary to popular belief  a person would not be able to pass through the esophagus of a whale which generally measure less than 10cm in diameter although in larger baleen whales may be up to ten inches when fully distended  a structure with the same name is often found in invertebrates including molluscs and arthropods connecting the oral cavity with the stomach  in the cephalopods the brain often surrounds the esophagus  the mouth of gastropods opens into an esophagus which connects to the stomach because of torsion the esophagus usually passes around the stomach and opens into its posterior portion furthest from the mouth in species that have undergone detorsion however the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach which is therefore reversed from the usual gastropod arrangement  in tarebia granifera the brood pouch is above the esophagus  there is available an extensive rostrum on the anterior part of the esophagus in all carnivorous gastropods

V the respiratory tract antimicrobial defense system is a layered defense mechanism which relies on components of both the innate and adaptive immune systems to protect the lungs and the rest of the respiratory tract against inhaled microorganisms in the first line of defense inhaled bacteria are trapped by mucus and are swept toward the pharynx and are swallowed  bacteria which penetrate the mucous layer are dealt with a second line of defense which includes antimicrobial peptides that are secreted by the surface epithelium of the respiratory tract which kill many strains of bacteria  those bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobial peptides are killed by a variety of reactive oxygen species produced by phagocytes in a third line of defense and as a last resort persistent bacterial infections which escape the innate immune system are eliminated by the adaptive immune system   lactoferrin lf is a multifunctional protein which is an essential part of the respiratory tract antimicrobial defense system  lf proteolysis produces the small peptides lactoferricin and kaliocin1 both with antimicrobial activity  phagocytes possess a superoxideproducing nadph oxidase enzyme complex  other cells in the respiratory tract also produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide through the activity of dual oxidase 2 proteins also known as duox2   the superoxide generated by these enzymes complexes dismutates into hydrogen peroxide which in turn is used by myeloperoxidase to produce bactericidal hypochlorous acid  in addition the submucosal glands of the respiratory tract secrete myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase lpo  that catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate and detoxify hydrogen peroxide or ros to the antimicrobial hypothiocyanite   the oxygenated compounds produced by the lactoperoxidase system does not attack dna and is not mutagenic and is known to be safe  hypothiocyanite generated through this pathway displays broad spectrum bactericidal activity including potent antibacterial action on h pylori  thiocyanate secretion  in cystic fibrosis patients is decreased resulting in a reduced production of the antimicrobial hypothiocyanite and consequently contributes to the increased risk of airway infection   lactoferrin with hypothiocyanite for the treatment of cystic fibrosis has been granted orphan drug status by the emea  and the fda

V the lateral line is a system of sense organs found in aquatic vertebrates mainly fish used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water the sensory ability is achieved via modified epithelial cells known as hair cells which respond to displacement caused by motion and transduce these signals into electrical impulses via excitatory synapses lateral lines serve an important role in schooling behavior predation and orientation for example fish can use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey they are usually visible as faint lines running lengthwise down each side from the vicinity of the gill covers to the base of the tail in some species the receptive organs of the lateral line have been modified to function as electroreceptors which are organs used to detect electrical impulses and as such these systems remain closely linked most amphibian larvae and some fully aquatic adult amphibians possess mechanosensitive systems comparable to the lateral line    the lateral line system allows the detection of movement and vibrations in the water surrounding an animal providing spatial awareness and the ability to navigate in space this plays an essential role in orientation predatory behavior and social schooling in a 2001 study researchers demonstrated that the lateral line system was necessary to detect vibrations made by prey and to orient towards the source to begin predatory action  fish were able to detect movement produced either by prey or a vibrating metal sphere and orient themselves toward the source before proceeding to make a predatory strike at it this behavior persisted even in blinded fish but was greatly diminished when lateral line function was inhibited by cocl2 application this cobalt chloride treatment results in the release of cobalt ions disrupting ionic transport and preventing signal transduction in the lateral lines  further trials using either a gentamicin dip or external scraping of the lateral lines to disrupt canal and superficial receptors respectively demonstrated that these behaviors were dependent specifically on mechanoreceptors located within the canals of the lateral line  the role mechanoreception plays in schooling behavior was demonstrated in a 1976 study by pitcher et al a school of pollachius virens was established in a tank and individual fish were removed and subjected to different procedures before their ability to rejoin the school was observed fish that were experimentally blinded were able to reintegrate into the school while fish with severed lateral lines were unable to reintegrate themselves therefore reliance on functional mechanoreception not vision is essential for schooling behavior  a study in 2014 suggests that the lateral line system plays an important role in the behavior of mexican blind cave fish astyanax mexicanus  the major unit of functionality of the lateral line is the neuromast the neuromast is a mechanoreceptive organ which allows the sensing of mechanical changes in water there are two main varieties of neuromasts located in animals canal neuromasts and superficial or freestanding neuromasts superficial neuromasts are located externally on the surface of the body while canal neuromasts are located along the lateral lines in subdermal fluid filled canals each neuromast consists of receptive hair cells whose tips are covered by a flexible and jellylike cupula hair cells typically possess both glutamatergic afferent connections and efferent connections using acetylcholine  the receptive hair cells are modified epithelial cells and typically possess bundles of 4050 microvilli hairs which function as the mechanoreceptors  these bundles are organized in rough staircases of hairs of increasing length order  this use of mechanosensitive hairs is homologous to the functioning of hair cells in the auditory and vestibular systems indicating a close link between these systems  hair cells utilize a system of transduction that uses rate coding in order to transmit the directionality of a stimulus hair cells of the lateral line system produce a constant tonic rate of firing as mechanical motion is transmitted through water to the neuromast the cupula bends and is displaced varying in magnitude with the strength of the stimulus shearing movement and deflection of the hairs is produced either toward the longest hair or away from it this results in a shift in the cells ionic permeability resulting from changes to open ion channels caused by the deflection of the hairs deflection towards the longest hair results in depolarization of the hair cell increased neurotransmitter release at the excitatory afferent synapse and a higher rate of signal transduction deflection towards the shorter hair has the opposite effect hyperpolarizing the hair cell and producing a decreased rate of neurotransmitter release  these electrical impulses are then transmitted along afferent lateral neurons to the brain while both varieties of neuromasts utilize this method of transduction the specialized organization of superficial and canal neuromasts allow them different mechanoreceptive capacities located at the surface of an animals skin superficial organs are exposed more directly to the external environment though they these organs possess the standard staircase shaped hair bundles overall the organization of the bundles within the organs is seemingly haphazard incorporating various shapes and sizes of microvilli within bundles this suggests a wide range of detection potentially indicating a function of broad detection to determine the presence and magnitude of deflection caused by motion in the surrounding water  in contrast the structure of canal organs allow canal neuromasts to be organized into a network system that allows more sophisticated mechanoreception such as the detection of pressure differentials as current moves across the pores of a canal a pressure differential is created over the pores as pressure on one pore exceeds that of another pore the differential pushes down on the canal and causes flow in the canal fluid this moves the cupula of the hair cells in the canal resulting in a directional deflection of the hairs corresponding to the direction of the flow  this method allows the translation of pressure information into directional deflections which can be received and transduced by hair cells the mechanoreceptive hair cells of the lateral line structure are integrated into more complex circuits through their afferent and efferent connections the synapses that directly participate in the transduction of mechanical information are excitatory afferent connections that utilize glutamate  however a variety of different neuromast and afferent connections are possible resulting in variation in mechanoreceptive properties for instance a series of experiments on the superficial neuromasts of porichthys notatus revealed that neuromasts can exhibit a receptive specificity for particular frequencies of stimulation  using an immobilized fish to prevent extraneous stimulation a metal ball was vibrated at different frequencies utilizing single cell measurements with a microelectrode responses were recorded and used to construct tuning curves which revealed frequency preferences and two main afferent nerve types one variety is attuned to collect mechanoreceptive information about acceleration responding to stimulation frequencies between 30200hz the other type is sensitive to velocity information and is most receptive to stimulation below 30hz this suggests a more intricate model of reception than was previously considered  the efferent synapses to hair cells are inhibitory and utilize acetylcholine they are crucial participants in a corollary discharge system designed to limit selfgenerated interference  when a fish moves it creates disturbances in the water that could be detected by the lateral line system potentially interfering with the detection of other biologically relevant signals to prevent this an afferent signal is sent to the hair cell upon motor action resulting in inhibition which counteracts the excitation resulting from reception of the selfgenerated stimulation this allows the fish to retain perception of motion stimuli without interference created by its own movements after signals transduced from the hair cells are transmitted along lateral neurons they eventually reach the brain visualization methods have revealed that the area where these signals most often terminate is the medial octavolateralis nucleus mon  it is likely that the mon plays an important role in the processing and integrating mechanoreceptive information  this has been supported through other experiments such as the use of golgi staining and microscopy by new  coombs to demonstrate the presence of distinct cell layers within the mon distinct layers of basilar and nonbasilar crest cells were identified within the deep mon drawing a comparison to similar cells in the closely related etectrosensory lateral line lobe of electric fish it seems to suggest possible computational pathways of the mon the mon is likely involved in the integration of sophisticated excitatory and inhibitory parallel circuits in order to interpret mechanoreceptive information

V the testicle from latin testiculus diminutive of testis meaning witness of virility  plural testes is the male gonad in animals like the ovaries to which they are homologous testes are components of both the reproductive system and the endocrine system the primary functions of the testes are to produce sperm spermatogenesis and to produce androgens primarily testosterone both functions of the testicle are influenced by gonadotropic hormones produced by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone lh results in testosterone release the presence of both testosterone and folliclestimulating hormone fsh is needed to support spermatogenesis it has also been shown in animal studies that if testes are exposed to either too high or too low levels of estrogens such as estradiol e2 spermatogenesis can be disrupted to such an extent that the animals become infertile    almost all healthy male vertebrates have two testicles they are typically of similar size although in sharks that on the right side is usually larger and in many bird and mammal species the left may be the larger the primitive jawless fish have only a single testis located in the midline of the body although even this forms from the fusion of paired structures in the embryo  the testicles of a dromedary camel are 710cm 2839in long 45cm 18in deep and 5cm 20in in width the right testicle is often smaller than the left  the testicles of a male red fox attain their greatest weight in decemberfebruary  spermatogenesis in male golden jackals occurs 1012 days before the females enter estrus and during this time males testicles triple in weight  in mammals the testes are often contained within an extension of the abdomen called the scrotum in mammals with external testes it is most common for one testicle to hang lower than the other while the size of the testicle varies it is estimated that 219 of men have their higher testicle being their left while 273 of men have reported to have equally positioned testicles  this is due to differences in the vascular anatomical structure on the right and left sides in healthy european adult humans average testicular volume is 18cm³ per testis with normal size ranging from 12cm³ to 30cm³  the average testicle size after puberty measures up to around 2inches long 08inches in breadth and 12inches in height 5 x 2 x 3cm measurement in the living adult is done in two basic ways the volume is then calculated using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid 43 \u03c0  length2  width2  depth2 human testicles are smaller than chimpanzee testicles but larger than gorilla testicles  the size of the testicles is among the parameters of the tanner scale for the maturity of male genitals from stage i which represents a volume of less than 15 ml to stage v which represents a testicular volume of greater than 20 ml under a tough membranous shell the tunica albuginea the testis of amniotes and some teleost fish contains very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules the tubules are lined with a layer of cells germ cells that from puberty into old age develop into sperm cells also known as spermatozoa or male gametes the developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the mediastinum testis to the efferent ducts and then to the epididymis where newly created sperm cells mature see spermatogenesis the sperm move into the vas deferens and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the urethral orifice through muscular contractions amphibians and most fish do not possess seminiferous tubules instead the sperm are produced in spherical structures called sperm ampullae these are seasonal structures releasing their contents during the breeding season and then being reabsorbed by the body before the next breeding season new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen the ampullae are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates including the same range of cell types  blood supply and lymphatic drainage of the testes and scrotum are distinct many anatomical features of the adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen the layers of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior abdominal wall notably the cremasteric muscle arises from the internal oblique muscle large molecules cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the presence of tight junctions between adjacent sertoli cells the spermatogonia are in the basal compartment deep to the level of the tight junctions and the more mature forms such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids are in the adluminal compartment the function of the bloodtestis barrier red highlight in diagram above may be to prevent an autoimmune reaction mature sperm and their antigens arise long after immune tolerance is established in infancy therefore since sperm are antigenically different from self tissue a male animal can react immunologically to his own sperm in fact he is capable of making antibodies against them injection of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis autoimmune orchitis and reduced fertility thus the bloodtestis barrier may reduce the likelihood that sperm proteins will induce an immune response reducing fertility and so progeny the testes work best at temperatures slightly less than core body temperature  the spermatogenesis is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures  this is presumably why the testes are located outside the body  there are a number of mechanisms to maintain the testes at the optimum temperature the cremasteric muscle is part of the spermatic cord when this muscle contracts the cord is shortened and the testicle is moved closer up toward the body which provides slightly more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature when cooling is required the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicle is lowered away from the warm body and is able to cool it also occurs in response to stress the testicles rise up toward the body in an effort to protect them in a fight there are persistent reports that relaxation indicates approach of orgasm  there is a noticeable tendency to also retract during orgasm  the cremaster muscle can reflexively raise each testicle individually if properly triggered this phenomenon is known as the cremasteric reflex the testicles can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle which partially activates related muscles there are two phases in which the testes grow substantially namely in embryonic and pubertal age during mammalian development the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes  in humans starting at about week 4 the gonadal rudiments are present within the intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys at about week 6 sex cords develop within the forming testes these are made up of early sertoli cells that surround and nurture the germ cells that migrate into the gonads shortly before sex determination begins in males the sexspecific gene sry that is found on the ychromosome initiates sex determination by downstream regulation of sexdetermining factors such as gata4 sox9 and amh which leads to development of the male phenotype including directing development of the early bipotential gonad down the male path of development testes follow the path of descent from high in the posterior fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the inguinal canal and into the scrotum in most cases 97 fullterm 70 preterm both testes have descended by birth in most other cases only one testis fails to descend cryptorchidism and that will probably express itself within a year the testes grow in response to the start of spermatogenesis size depends on lytic function sperm production amount of spermatogenesis present in testis interstitial fluid and sertoli cell fluid production after puberty the volume of the testes can be increased by over 500 as compared to the prepubertal size  testicles are fully descended before one reaches puberty the basal condition for mammals is to have internal testes boreoeutherian land mammals however the large group of mammals that includes humans have externalized testes  their testes function best at temperatures lower than their core body temperature their testes are located outside of the body suspended by the spermatic cord within the scrotum the testes of the nonboreotherian mammals such as the monotremes armadillos sloths elephants remain within the abdomen  there are also some boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes such as the rhinoceros marine boreotherian mammals such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes as external testes would increase drag in the water they have internal testes which are kept cool by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin there are several hypotheses why most boreotherian mammals have external testes which operate best at a temperature that is slightly less than the core body temperature eg that it is stuck with enzymes evolved in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production 1 more efficient the classic hypothesis is that cooler temperature of the testes allows for more efficient fertile spermatogenesis in other words there are no possible enzymes operating at normal core body temperature that are as efficient as the ones evolved at least none appearing in our evolution so far the early mammals had lower body temperatures and thus their testes worked efficiently within their body however it is argued that boreotherian mammals have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop external testes to keep them cool it is argued that those mammals with internal testes such as the monotremes armadillos sloths elephants and rhinoceroses have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes however the question remains why birds despite having very high core body temperatures have internal testes and did not evolve external testes  it was once theorized that birds used their air sacs to cool the testes internally but later studies revealed that birds testes are able to function at core body temperature  some mammals which have seasonal breeding cycles keep their testes internal until the breeding season at which point their testes descend and increase in size and become external  2 irreversible adaptation to sperm competition it has been suggested that the ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals was a small mammal that required very large testes perhaps rather like those of a hamster for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the body  this led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis spermatogenic dna polymerase beta and recombinase activities evolving a unique temperature optimum slightly less than core body temperature when the boreoeutherian mammals then diversified into forms that were larger andor did not require intense sperm competition they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures and had to keep their testes outside the body this position is made less parsimonious by the fact that the kangaroo a nonboreoeutherian mammal has external testicles the ancestors of kangaroos might separately from boreotherian mammals have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed external testes however kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible adaptive function for external testes in large animals 3 protection from abdominal cavity pressure changes one argument for the evolution of external testes is that it protects the testes from abdominal cavity pressure changes caused by jumping and galloping  testicular size as a proportion of body weight varies widely in the mammalian kingdom there is a tendency for testicular size to correspond with multiple mates eg harems polygamy production of testicular output sperm and spermatic fluid is also larger in polygamous animals possibly a spermatogenic competition for survival the testes of the right whale are likely to be the largest of any animal each weighing around 500kg 1100lb  among the hominidae gorillas have little female promiscuity and sperm competition and the testes are small compared to body weight 003 chimpanzees have high promiscuity and large testes compared to body weight 03 human testicular size falls between these extremes 008  there is some evidence to suggest that average human testicle size and weight has been progressively shrinking in recent years among younger cohorts in western industrialized nations this has been suggested to be associated with a possible decline in sperm counts in some world regions the recent changes suggest involvement of environmental or lifestyle factors such as increasing exposure to endocrine disruptors  testis weight also varies in seasonal breeders like deer and horses  the change is related to changes in testosterone production  some prominent conditions and differential diagnoses include to some extent it is possible to change testicular size short of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions eg higher temperature than they are normally accustomed to they can be shrunk by competing against their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered steroidal hormones steroids taken for muscle enhancement especially anabolic steroids often have the undesired side effect of testicular shrinkage similarly stimulation of testicular functions via gonadotropiclike hormones may enlarge their size testes may shrink or atrophy during hormone replacement therapy or through chemical castration in all cases the loss in testes volume corresponds with a loss of spermatogenesis testicles of a male calf or other livestock are used to comprise a dish sometimes called rocky mountain oysters  in the middle ages men who wanted a boy sometimes had their left testicle removed this was because people believed that the right testicle made boy sperm and the left made girl sperm  as early as 330 bc aristotle prescribed the ligation tying off of the left testicle in men wishing to have boys  the etymology of the word is based on roman law the latin word testis witness was used in the firmly established legal principle testis unus testis nullus one witness equals no witness meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another this led to the common practice of producing two witnesses bribed to testify the same way in cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives since such witnesses always came in pairs the meaning was accordingly extended often in the diminutive testiculus testiculi  another theory says that testis is influenced by a loan translation from greek parastat\u0113s defender in law supporter that is two glands side by side  testicle testicle testicle hanging on cremaster muscle these are two healthy testicles heat causes them to descend

V the salt gland is an organ for excreting excess salts it is found in elasmobranchs sharks rays and skates seabirds and some reptiles sharks glands are found in their rectum birds and reptiles in or on the skull in the area of the eyes nostrils or mouth these glands are lobed containing many secretory tubules which radiate outward from the excretory canal at the center secretory tubules are lined with a single layer of epithelial cells the diameter and length at which these glands are vary depending on the salt uptake of the species  salt glands maintain salt balance and allow marine vertebrates to drink seawater  active transport via sodiumpotassium pump found on the basolateral membrane action moves salt from the blood into the gland where it is excreted as a concentrated solution   the avian salt gland has two main ducts which are a medial and a lateral salt gland activations occurs from increased osmolarity in the blood stimulating the hypothalamic information processing sending signal through the parasympathetic nerve activating vasodilation the release of hormones acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal peptide  acetylcholine binds to the receptor on the basolateral membrane of the gland this in turn activates calcium release in the epithelial cells opening potassium channels flowing potassium out of the cells on the basolateral membrane and chloride channels on the apical membrane to flow out of the cell ions are moved into the epithelial cells by a nakcl cotransporter also in the basolateral membrane increases in sodium opens the sodiumpotassium atpase channels removing the excess sodium back out across the basolateral membrane and allowing for potassium to come into the cell an electrical gradient is formed from the chloride ions allowing sodium to be passed through the tight junctions of the epithelial cells into the salt gland along with minimal amounts of water as well mitochondria rich cells are associated with changes in salt concentration increasing with higher amounts and decreasing with lower exposure assisting in the movement of salts these glands excrete the hypertonic sodiumchloride with few other ions by the stimulus of central and peripheral osmoreceptors and volume receptors the need for salt excretion in reptiles such as marine iguanas and sea turtles and birds such as petrels and albatrosses reflects their having much less efficient kidneys than mammals as marine mammal kidneys can deal with seawater  unlike the skin of amphibians that of reptiles and birds is impermeable to salt preventing its release  the evolution of a salt gland in early reptiles and birds allowed them to eat aquatic plants and animals with high salt concentrations this evolutionary development does not account for the gland in elasmobranchs suggesting convergent evolution some theories suggest mammalian tear ducts and sweat glands may be evolutionarily related to salt glands while human tears are high in potassium most phylogeneticists disagree with the association

V cystogastrostomy is a surgery to create an opening between a pancreatic pseudocyst and the stomach when the cyst is in a suitable position to be drained into the stomach  this conserves pancreatic juices that would otherwise be lost  this surgery is performed by a pancreatic surgeon to avoid a lifethreatening rupture of the pancreatic pseudocyst    symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts are an indication a cystogastrostomy needs to be performed pancreatic pseudocysts are chronic collections of pancreatic fluid encased by a wall of nonepithelialized granulation tissue and fibrosis they can be caused by leakage of the pancreatic duct or as a result of inflammatory pancreatitis  symptoms of this include abdominal bloating difficulty eating and digesting food and constant pain or deep ache in the abdomen a lump can be felt in the middle or left upper abdomen if a pseudocyst is present to further diagnose a pancreatic pseudocyst an abdominal ct scan mri or ultrasound can be used  emergency surgery may need to be performed if there is a rupture of the pseudocyst this can be detected from symptoms of bleeding shock fainting fever and chills rapid heartbeat or severe abdominal pain  surgical repair is carried out through an incision in the abdomen after locating the pseudocyst it is attached to the wall of the stomach and the cystogastrostomy is created this is the most expensive of the three methods  although it has a high success rate it is infrequently used because of the extensive recovery period  a relatively new and lessinvasive method involving endoscopic ultrasound eus guidance and fluoroscopy a large bore needle is used to access the identified pseudocyst creating a fistula between the cystic cavity and either the stomach or the duodenum  plastic stents may be placed to facilitate drainage from the pseudocyst  the success rate of endoscopic treatment of pseudocysts may be greater than 70  this method is the second of two less invasive surgeries used to drain pseudocysts and can be performed by a single surgeon because of the advanced tools the pseudocyst is identified and accessed using laparoscopic techniques once the pseudocyst cavity is located it is entered and aspirated and an opening is created into the stomach for drainage laparoscopic drainage may result in better cosmetic appearance and decreased pain following surgery  cystogastrostomy can lead to pancreatic abscess  and pancreatic duct leak stents can become blocked leading to infection of the pseudocyst  other complications include those normally associated with surgery and anesthesia including bleeding jedlicka first described the procedure

V the islands of calleja  ic isc or iclj are a group of neural granule cells located within the ventral striatum in the brains of most animals this region of the brain is part of the limbic system where it aids in the reinforcing effects of rewardlike activities within most species the islands are specifically located within the olfactory tubercle however in primates these islands are located within the nucleus accumbens the reward center of the brain since the olfactory tubercle has practically disappeared in the brains of primates  both of these structures have been implicated in the processing of incentives as well as addictions to drugs  projections to and from the islands supplement this knowledge with their involvement in the reward pathways for both cocaine and amphetamines    the islands of calleja are specifically located within the ventral and medial lining of the ventral striatum in the brain meaning that they lie towards the front and middle of this region within the temporal lobe the insula magna or the major island of these complexes is located in the medial border of the nucleus accumbens the ventral group of the islands lies along the pial border of the basal forebrain a region of the frontal lobe that lies adjacent to the temporal lobe  due to high concentrations of nitric oxide synthase an enzyme that makes nitric oxide and includes another enzyme known as nadphdiaphorase the islands can be visualized via nadphdiaphorase staining using this method the islands have been suggested to be a single heterogeneous cell complex the exact grouping of these structures is unique across species however the shaping of the structures is not the same across the hemispheres of the brain  the islands of calleja are named after julián calleja y sánchez the spanish anatomist who studied the structure prior to publishing a paper in 1893 entitled la región olfatoria del cerebro the olfactory region of the brain although the structure was named after him calleja was not the first to study it sigbert ganser a german psychiatrist published a paper in 1882 that discussed the region  furthermore the current accepted definition of the islands of calleja is not the same as the region calleja himself studied he was examining the thick portions of the cell layer of the olfactory tubercle rather than the granule cells that bear his name today  originating from the lateral ganglionic eminence one of the three embryonic structures that eventually become specific parts of the brain the subventricular zone svz is a group of cells that develop along the surface of the ventricular layer of the brain following the creation of the cortical plate in embryos the cells generated from this region migrate either radially along or tangentially to radial glia the cells that help guide neurons to their targeted destination these progenitors from the svz are best known for their migration down the rostral migratory stream to differentiate into the different cells of the olfactory bulb however a separate mass of cells referred to as the ventral migratory mass migrates from the svz to the basal forebrain where it develops into the islands of calleja  the fox family is a group of genes encoding certain transcription factors that all begin with the same group of nucleotides that attach to a specific promoter on a dna strand most members of the fox proteins are typically involved in the formation of certain structures of an embryo where mutations in these genes are evident through the human developmental disorders that result of these genes the foxp2 variant was the first to be connected to inherited language and speech disorders within the islands of calleja foxp2 gene expression has been observed in the developing basal forebrain of monkeys as well as rodents furthermore this gene expression has been viewed alongside the expression of two other transcription factors pbx3 and meis2 developing neurons that express these genes originate from the subventricular zone for this reason the involvement of all three of these genes is thought to be responsible for determining the final destination of the neurons in the islands of calleja  in rodents the islands of calleja are composed of seven distinct clusters within the olfactory tubercle with the major island creating a border between the septum the nucleus accumbens and the diagonal band some of the islands contain a core of neuropil or unmyelinated axons and dendrites filled with a large cell in some cases projections to and from the islands connect the structures to the piriform cortex which is responsible for processing smell as well as areas of the basal forebrain a region responsible for determining an animals level of wakefulness the projections with the piriform cortex align with the rest of the olfactory system the path beginning in the sensory cells of the nose and then proceeding through the olfactory bulb to regions such as the piriform cortex olfactory tubercle and amygdala however the projections to the basal forebrain structures actually originate from the smaller outer cells of the island clusters as opposed to the large cells within the core the islands of calleja receive inputs from the back of the amygdala which processes emotional memory  as well as the septum nucleus accumbens and piriform cortex  the islands also receive information in the form of dopamine from the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area located in the midbrain of the brainstem information traveling from these midbrain structures is triggered in response to rewarding activities or feelings the islands project to the back of the thalamus a region with many responsibilities such as sensory information processing regulation of wakefulness and relaying information to the cerebral cortex  as is the case with many structures of the brain many of the functions of the islands of calleja have yet to be confirmed and remain suggestions the islands regulate the amount of blood supplied to the ventral pallidum and other surrounding areas by adjusting the degree of dilation of the blood vessels that pass through the islands and the ventral pallidum this vasodilation is adjusted by the action of nitric oxide injection of glutamate into the islands results in decreases in arterial pressure and heart rate suggesting that the islands are involved to some degree in the regulation of arterial pressure and heart rate the islands also inhibit the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the cardiovascular system by responding to changes in pressure  changes in behavior due to schizophrenia have been traced back to the high level of d3 dopamine receptors within the islands of calleja as well as the high concentrations of dopamine passing through them damage to the islands due to restricted blood supply has been linked to a condition of amnesia and personality changes other behavioral and emotional responses occur as well due to serotonin that interacts with the islands  the islands of calleja are directly connected with some of the major reward centers of the brain by receiving dopamine inputs from the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area the islands become one of the many regions that process the rewarding feelings associated with this neurotransmitter the interactions of the islands with the amygdala aid in processing how the body remembers the feelings associated with the release of dopamine opioids and amphetamines take advantage of the reward pathways in that they influence greater releases of dopamine and other neurotransmitters that reinforce the feelings associated with the administration and effects of the drugs the islands of calleja become more involved with substances administered through the nose due to the islands involvement in both olfaction and the reward pathways some of the neurons within the islands also act as interneurons passing on information between other brain regions along the same pathway as the islands  in rodents the islands play a role in reproduction due to the neurons estrogenbinding capacity and the structures ability to concentrate estradiol  they also play a role in the reward pathways and processing pheromone inputs from the nose

V a spermatophore or sperm ampulla is a capsule or mass containing spermatozoa created by males of various animal species especially salamanders and arthropods and transferred in entirety to the females ovipore during reproduction spermatophores may additionally contain nourishment for the female in which case it is called a nuptial gift as in the instance of bush crickets   in the case of the toxic moth utetheisa ornatrix the spermatophore includes sperm nutrients and pyrrolizidine alkaloids pa which prevent predation because it is poisonous to most organisms  however in some species such as the ediths checkerspot butterfly the gift provides little nutrient value the spermatophore transferred at mating has little effect on female reproductive output  the alternative hypothesis of its usefulness is that the process of eating the spermatophore prevents the female from subsequent copulation thereby giving the males sperm more time to fertilize  spermatophores are the norm in arachnids in various insects such as bush crickets the spermatophore is often surrounded by a proteinaceous spermatophylax the function of the spermatophylax is to cause the female to relinquish some of her control over the insemination process allowing full sperm transfer from the spermatophore  some species of butterflies and moths also deposit a spermatophore into the female during copulation examples include the speckled wood butterfly   or the ornate moth where males invest up to 10 of their body mass in creating a single spermatophore  some vertebrates also reproduce via spermatophores males of most salamander and newt species create spermatophores which the females may choose to take up or not depending on the success of the males mating display

V the lung float test also called the hydrostatic test or docimasia  is a controversial autopsy procedure used in determining whether lungs have undergone respiration it has historically been employed in cases of suspected infanticide to help determine whether or not an infant was stillborn in the test lungs that float in water are thought to have been aerated while those that sink are presumed to indicate an absence of air the test is not infallible and many factors can cause the test to give false positive or negative results decomposition may result in postmortem gas formation allowing a nonaerated lung to float  during labor air can be introduced to a deceased infants lungs while moving through the birth canal lungs exposed to air do not always float  große ostendorf et al showed the procedure gave a false result in 2 of cases  in a 1997 paper jj moar emphasises the risk of misdiagnosing live birth writing that the majority of new born infants seen at autopsy show signs of varying degrees of decomposition as they are often found in garbage wrapped in newspaper or plastic bags or lying in an open \ufb01eld even microscopic putrefaction can cause unexpanded lungs to \ufb02oat when gas formation may not be macroscopically apparent naturally any attempts at resuscitation may partially expand the lungs of a new born infant leading to further dif\ufb01culty in establishing live birth  the difference between the lungs of a foetus and those of an infant was noted by the ancient greek physician galen  the lung float test was described in the 1670s by hungarian botanist károly rayger and first performed in 1681  german physician johannes schreyer performed a lung float test in 1690  the application of the lung float test to determine breathing and live birth has many medicolegal considerations in south africa a foetus must have breathed to be considered a person under the law  lung float tests are also used by forensic pathologists to determine if a subject drowned

V gonopods are specialized appendages of various arthropods used in reproduction or egglaying in males they facilitate the transfer of sperm from male to female during mating and thus are a type of intromittent organ in crustaceans and millipedes gonopods are modified walking or swimming legs gonopods may be highly decorated with elaborate structures which may play roles in sperm competition and can be used to differentiate and identify closely related species gonopods generally occur in one or more pairs as opposed to the single unpaired reproductive organs such as the aedeagus of insects or the penis of harvestmen   in insects gonopods are appendages of the genital segment that may be used in insemination or that comprise the egglaying apparatus   in male decapod crustaceans gonopods are modified swimming appendages pleopods the anterior two pair of pleopods in males are modified for sperm transferring with differing degree of morphological diversification  in millipedes gonopods consist of one or two pairs of often highly modified walking legs in mature males and are primarily found in members of the subgroup helminthomorpha containing most orders and the vast majority of species where they are located on the seventh body segment consisting of leg pairs 8 andor 9  males of the subgroup pentazonia which includes the oniscomorpha pill millipedes and glomeridesmida lack gonopods but possess enlarged appendages known as telopods at the rear of the body used to firmly hold females during mating  the complex structure of gonopods is a primary method of distinguishing closely related species of millipede  although the terminology used to describe the same structures may vary between authors  the complex morphology of millipede gonopods may be driven by sperm competition or other forms of sexual selection with some structures serving to scoop out or displace sperm of other males and others acting to stimulate females into becoming sexually receptive  millipede gonopods do not produce sperm directly but rather gather sperm produced from a gonopore on the base of the third body segment  gonopods develop gradually during the growth of an individual in early developmental stages all legs are of the walking type and cannot be used to determine sex through successive molts the walking legs metamorphose into mature gonopods

V the visual word form area vwfa is a functional region of the fusiform gyrus that is hypothesized to be involved in identifying words and letters from lowerlevel shape images prior to association with phonology or semantics   because the alphabet is relatively new in human evolution it is unlikely that this region developed as a result of selection pressures related to word recognition per se however this region may be highly specialized for certain types of shapes that occur naturally in the environment and are therefore likely to surface within written language  in addition to word recognition the vwfa may participate in higherlevel processing of word meaning  in 2003 functional imaging experiments have also raised doubts about whether the vwfa is an actual region  this skepticism has largely disappeared however there seems to be much variability in its size an area that may fall within this mental organ in one person may fall outside it in someone else   anomalies in the activation of this region have been linked to reading disorders  if the area is subjected to a surgical lesion the patient will suffer a clear impairment to reading ability but not to recognition of objects names or faces or to general language abilities there will be some improvement over the next six months but reading will still take twice as long as it had before surgery

V the human brain is the main organ of the human central nervous system it is located in the head protected by the skull it has the same general structure as the brains of other mammals but with a more developed cerebral cortex large animals such as whales and elephants have larger brains in absolute terms but when measured using a measure of relative brain size which compensates for body size the quotient for the human brain is almost twice as large as that of a bottlenose dolphin and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee though the quotient for a treeshrew brain is larger than that of a humans  much of the size of the human brain comes from the cerebral cortex especially the frontal lobes which are associated with executive functions such as selfcontrol planning reasoning and abstract thought the area of the cerebral cortex devoted to vision the visual cortex is also greatly enlarged in humans compared to other animals the human cerebral cortex is a thick layer of neural tissue that covers most of the brain this layer is folded in a way that increases the amount of surface area that can fit into the volume available the pattern of folds is similar across individuals but shows many small variations the cortex is divided into four lobes  the frontal lobe parietal lobe temporal lobe and occipital lobe some classification systems also include a limbic lobe and treat the insular cortex as a lobe within each lobe are numerous cortical areas each associated with a particular function including vision motor control and language the left and right sides of the cortex are broadly similar in shape and most cortical areas are replicated on both sides some areas though show strong lateralization particularly areas that are involved in language in most people the left hemisphere is dominant for language with the right hemisphere playing only a minor role there are other functions such as visualspatial ability for which the right hemisphere is usually dominant despite being protected by the thick bones of the skull suspended in cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from the bloodstream by the bloodbrain barrier the human brain is susceptible to damage and disease the most common forms of physical damage are closed head injuries such as a blow to the head a stroke or poisoning by a variety of chemicals which can act as neurotoxins such as ethanol alcohol infection of the brain though serious is rare because of the biological barriers which protect it the human brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders such as parkinsons disease and alzheimers disease mostly as the result of aging and multiple sclerosis a number of psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and clinical depression are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions although the nature of these is not well understood the brain can also be the site of brain tumors and these can be benign or malignant there are some techniques for studying the brain that are used in other animals that are just not suitable for use in humans and vice versa it is easier to obtain individual brain cells taken from other animals for study it is also possible to use invasive techniques in other animals such as inserting electrodes into the brain or disabling certains parts of the brain in order to examine the effects on behaviour  techniques that are not possible to be used in humans however only humans can respond to complex verbal instructions or be of use in the study of important brain functions such as language and other complex cognitive tasks but studies from humans and from other animals can be of mutual help medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and eeg recordings are important techniques in studying the brain the complete functional understanding of the human brain is an ongoing challenge for neuroscience   the adult human brain weighs on average about 1315kg 2933lb or about 2 of total body weight   with a volume of around 1130 cubic centimetres cm  in women and 1260cm  in men although there is substantial individual variation  neurological differences between the sexes have not been shown to correlate in any simple way with iq or other measures of cognitive performance  the human brain is composed of neurons glial cells and blood vessels the number of neurons according to array tomography has been shown to be on average about 86 billion in the adult human brain with a roughly equal number about 84 billion of nonneuronal cells  out of these 16 billion or 19 of all brain neurons are located in the cerebral cortex including subcortical white matter 69 billion or 80 of all brain neurons are in the cerebellum and fewer than 1 of all brain neurons are located in the rest of the brain  the cerebral hemispheres the cerebrum form the largest part of the human brain and are situated above other brain structures they are covered with a cortical layer the cerebral cortex which has a convoluted topography  underneath the cerebrum lies the brainstem resembling a stalk on which the cerebrum is attached at the rear of the brain beneath the cerebrum and behind the brainstem is the cerebellum a structure with a horizontally furrowed surface the cerebellar cortex that makes it look different from any other brain area the same structures are present in other mammals although they vary considerably in relative size as a rule the smaller the cerebrum the less convoluted the cortex the cortex of a rat or mouse is almost perfectly smooth the cortex of a dolphin or whale on the other hand is more convoluted than the cortex of a human the living brain is very soft having a gellike consistency similar to soft tofu although referred to as grey matter the live cortex is pinkishbeige in color and slightly offwhite in the interior the human brain has many properties that are common to all vertebrate brains including a basic division into three parts called the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain with interconnected fluidfilled ventricles and a set of generic vertebrate brain structures including the medulla oblongata and pons of the brainstem the cerebellum optic tectum thalamus hypothalamus basal ganglia olfactory bulb and many others as a mammalian brain the human brain has special features that are common to all mammalian brains most notably a sixlayered cerebral cortex and a set of structures associated with it including the hippocampus and amygdala all vertebrates have a forebrain whose upper surface is covered with a layer of neural tissue called the pallium but in all except mammals the pallium has a relatively simple threelayered cell structure in mammals it has a much more complex sixlayered cell structure and is given a different name the cerebral cortex the hippocampus and amygdala also originate from the pallium but are much more complex in mammals than in other vertebrates as a primate brain the human brain has a much larger cerebral cortex in proportion to body size than most mammals and a very highly developed visual system the shape of the brain within the skull is also altered somewhat as a consequence of the upright position in which primates hold their heads as a hominid brain the human brain is substantially enlarged even in comparison to the brain of a typical monkey the sequence of evolution from australopithecus four million years ago to homo sapiens modern man was marked by a steady increase in brain size particularly in the frontal lobes which are associated with a variety of highlevel cognitive functions humans and other primates have some differences in gene sequence and genes are differentially expressed in many brain regions the functional differences between the human brain and the brains of other animals also arise from many geneenvironment interactions  the neuroimmune system of the brain is structurally distinct from the peripheral immune system which protects the rest of the body in particular the immune system is composed primarily of hematopoietic cells and anatomical barriers while the neuroimmune system is composed of glia mast cells and various brain barriers eg bloodbrain barrier and bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier the dominant feature of the human brain is corticalization the cerebral cortex in humans is so large that it overshadows every other part of the brain a few subcortical structures show alterations reflecting this trend the cerebellum for example has a medial zone connected mainly to subcortical motor areas and a lateral zone connected primarily to the cortex in humans the lateral zone takes up a much larger fraction of the cerebellum than in most other mammalian species corticalization is reflected in function as well as structure in a rat surgical removal of the entire cerebral cortex leaves an animal that is still capable of walking around and interacting with the environment  in a human comparable cerebral cortex damage produces a permanent state of coma the amount of association cortex relative to the other two categories of sensory and motor increases dramatically as one goes from simpler mammals such as the rat and the cat to more complex ones such as the chimpanzee and the human  a gene present in the human genome but not in the chimpanzee arhgap11b seems to play a major role in corticalization arhgap11b and human encephalisation the cerebral cortex is essentially a sheet of neural tissue folded in a way that allows a large surface area to fit within the confines of the skull when unfolded each cerebral hemisphere has a total surface area of about 13 square feet 012m   each cortical ridge is called a gyrus and each groove or fissure separating one gyrus from another is called a sulcus the cerebral cortex is nearly symmetrical with left and right hemispheres that are approximate mirror images of each other each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes the frontal lobe parietal lobe occipital lobe and temporal lobe with one exception this division into lobes does not derive from the structure of the cortex though the lobes are named after the bones of the skull that overlie them the frontal bone parietal bone temporal bone and occipital bone the borders between lobes lie beneath the sutures that link the skull bones together the exception is the border between the frontal and parietal lobes which lies behind the corresponding suture instead it follows the anatomical boundary of the central sulcus a deep fold in the brains structure where the primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex meet because of the arbitrary way most of the borders between lobes are demarcated they have little functional significance with the exception of the occipital lobe a small area that is entirely dedicated to vision each of the lobes contains a variety of brain areas that have minimal functional relationship the parietal lobe for example contains areas involved in somatosensation hearing language attention and spatial cognition in spite of this heterogeneity the division into lobes is convenient for reference the main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention abstract thinking behavior problem solving tasks and physical reactions and personality the occipital lobe is the smallest lobe its main functions are visual reception visualspatial processing movement and color recognition the temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories language and some hearing and speech although there are enough variations in the shape and placement of gyri and sulci cortical folds to make every brain unique most human brains show sufficiently consistent patterns of folding that allow them to be named many of the gyri and sulci are named according to the location on the lobes or other major folds on the cortex these include functions of the cortex are divided it into three categories of regions one consists of the primary sensory areas which receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus primary sensory areas include the visual area of the occipital lobe the auditory area in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe a second category is the primary motor cortex which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord this area occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe directly in front of the somatosensory area the third category consists of the remaining parts of the cortex which are called the association areas these areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex processes of perception thought and decisionmaking  different parts of the cerebral cortex are involved in different cognitive and behavioral functions the differences show up in a number of ways the effects of localized brain damage regional activity patterns exposed when the brain is examined using functional imaging techniques connectivity with subcortical areas and regional differences in the cellular architecture of the cortex neuroscientists describe most of the cortexthe part they call the neocortexas having six layers but not all layers are apparent in all areas and even when a layer is present its thickness and cellular organization may vary scientists have constructed maps of cortical areas on the basis of variations in the appearance of the layers as seen with a microscope one of the most widely used schemes came from korbinian brodmann who split the cortex into 51 different areas and assigned each a number many of these brodmann areas have since been subdivided for example brodmann area 1 is the primary somatosensory cortex brodmann area 17 is the primary visual cortex and brodmann area 25 is the anterior cingulate cortex  many of the brain areas brodmann defined have their own complex internal structures in a number of cases brain areas are organized into topographic maps where adjoining bits of the cortex correspond to adjoining parts of the body or of some more abstract entity a simple example of this type of correspondence is the primary motor cortex a strip of tissue running along the anterior edge of the central sulcus shown in the image to the right motor areas innervating each part of the body arise from a distinct zone with neighboring body parts represented by neighboring zones electrical stimulation of the cortex at any point causes a musclecontraction in the represented body part this somatotopic representation is not evenly distributed however the head for example is represented by a region about three times as large as the zone for the entire back and trunk the size of any zone correlates to the precision of motor control and sensory discrimination possible the areas for the lips fingers and tongue are particularly large considering the proportional size of their represented body parts in visual areas the maps are retinotopicthat is they reflect the topography of the retina the layer of lightactivated neurons lining the back of the eye in this case too the representation is uneven the foveathe area at the center of the visual fieldis greatly overrepresented compared to the periphery the visual circuitry in the human cerebral cortex contains several dozen distinct retinotopic maps each devoted to analyzing the visual input stream in a particular way the primary visual cortex brodmann area 17 which is the main recipient of direct input from the visual part of the thalamus contains many neurons that are most easily activated by edges with a particular orientation moving across a particular point in the visual field visual areas farther downstream extract features such as color motion and shape in auditory areas the primary map is tonotopic sounds are parsed according to frequency ie high pitch vs low pitch by subcortical auditory areas and this parsing is reflected by the primary auditory zone of the cortex as with the visual system there are a number of tonotopic cortical maps each devoted to analyzing sound in a particular way within a topographic map there can sometimes be finer levels of spatial structure in the primary visual cortex for example where the main organization is retinotopic and the main responses are to moving edges cells that respond to different edgeorientations are spatially segregated from one another during the first three weeks of gestation the human embryos ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate the neural plate then folds and closes to form the neural tube this tube flexes as it grows forming the crescentshaped cerebral hemispheres at the head and the cerebellum and pons towards the tail understanding the mindbody problem  the relationship between the brain and the mind  is a significant challenge both philosophically and scientifically this is because of the difficulty reconciling how mental activities such as thoughts and emotions can be implemented by physical structures such as neurons and synapses or by any other type of physical mechanism this difficulty was expressed by gottfried leibniz in an analogy known as leibnizs mill one is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles that is by figures and motions in imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think to sense and to have perception one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions so that one could enter into it just like into a windmill supposing this one should when visiting within it find only parts pushing one another and never anything by which to explain a perception doubt about the possibility of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove rené descartes and most of humankind along with him to dualism the belief that the mind exists independently of the brain  there has always however been a strong argument in the opposite direction there is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of or injuries to the brain for example by drugs or by lesions respectively can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways  for example a person suffering from alzheimers disease  a condition that causes physical damage to the brain  also experiences a compromised mind similarly someone who has taken a psychedelic drug may temporarily lose their sense of personal identity ego death or experience profound changes to their perception and thought processes likewise a patient with epilepsy who undergoes cortical stimulation mapping with electrical brain stimulation would also upon stimulation of his or her brain experience various complex feelings hallucinations memory flashbacks and other complex cognitive emotional or behavioral phenomena  following this line of thinking a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of or reducible to physical phenomena  each hemisphere of the brain interacts primarily with one half of the body but for reasons that are unclear the connections are crossed the left side of the brain interacts with the right side of the body and vice versa  motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain both cross the midline at the level of the brainstem visual input follows a more complex rule the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm and half of the fibers from each nerve split off to join the other the result is that connections from the left half of the retina in both eyes go to the left side of the brain whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain and vice versa thus the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body and visual input from the left side of the visual fieldan arrangement that presumably is helpful for visuomotor coordination the two cerebral hemispheres are connected by a very large nerve bundle the largest white matter structure in the brain called the corpus callosum which crosses the midline above the level of the thalamus  there are also two much smaller connections the anterior commissure and hippocampal commissure as well as many subcortical connections that cross the midline the corpus callosum is the main avenue of communication between the two hemispheres though it connects each point on the cortex to the mirrorimage point in the opposite hemisphere and also connects to functionally related points in different cortical areas in most respects the left and right sides of the brain are symmetrical in terms of function for example the counterpart of the lefthemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the righthemisphere area controlling the left hand there are however several very important exceptions involving language and spatial cognition in most people the left hemisphere is dominant for language a stroke that damages a key language area in the left hemisphere can leave the victim unable to speak or understand whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills a substantial part of current understanding of the interactions between the two hemispheres has come from the study of splitbrain patientspeople who underwent surgical transection of the corpus callosum in an attempt to reduce the severity of epileptic seizures these patients do not show unusual behavior that is immediately obvious but in some cases can behave almost like two different people in the same body with the right hand taking an action and then the left hand undoing it most of these patients when briefly shown a picture on the right side of the point of visual fixation are able to describe it verbally but when the picture is shown on the left are unable to describe it but may be able to give an indication with the left hand of the nature of the object shown the study of how language is represented processed and acquired by the brain is neurolinguistics which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics this field originated from the 19thcentury discovery that damage to different parts of the brain appeared to cause different symptoms physicians noticed that individuals with damage to a portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus now known as brocas area had difficulty in producing language aphasia of speech whereas those with damage to a region in the left superior temporal gyrus now known as wernickes area had difficulty in understanding it  since then there has been substantial debate over what linguistic processes these and other parts of the brain subserve  and although brocas and wernickes areas have traditionally been associated with language functions they may also be involved in certain nonspeech functions  there is also debate over whether or not there even is a strong onetoone relationship between brain regions and language functions that emerges during neocortical development  more recently research on language has increasingly used more modern methods including electrophysiology and functional neuroimaging to examine how language processing occurs iodine t4 and pufas stimulate the evolution of the nervous system in fact hypothyroidism in mammals causes cretinism and in adults a neurological regression as a general slowdown of nervous reflexes with lethargic cerebration metabolism digestion heart rate hypothermia   the brain consumes up to twenty percent of the energy used by the human body more than any other organ  brain metabolism normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source but during times of low glucose such as fasting exercise or limited carbohydrate intake the brain will use ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose the brain can also utilize lactate during exercise  longchain fatty acids cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier but the liver can break these down to produce ketones however the mediumchain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain    the brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle  although the human brain represents only 2 of the body weight it receives 15 of the cardiac output 20 of total body oxygen consumption and 25 of total body glucose utilization  the need to limit body weight has led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species such as bats who need to be able to fly  the brain mostly uses glucose for energy and deprivation of glucose as can happen in hypoglycemia can result in loss of consciousness the energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions this fact forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods pet and fmri  these are nuclear medicine imaging techniques which produce a threedimensional image of metabolic activity clinically death is defined as an absence of brain activity as measured by eeg injuries to the brain tend to affect large areas of the organ sometimes causing major deficits in intelligence memory personality and movement head trauma caused for example by vehicular or industrial accidents is a leading cause of death in youth and middle age in many cases more damage is caused by resultant edema than by the impact itself stroke caused by the blockage or rupturing of blood vessels in the brain is another major cause of death from brain damage other problems in the brain can be more accurately classified as diseases neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimers disease parkinsons disease huntingtons disease and motor neuron diseases are caused by the gradual death of individual neurons leading to diminution in movement control memory and cognition there are five motor neuron diseases the most common of which is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als some infectious diseases affecting the brain are caused by viruses and bacteria infection of the meninges the membranes that cover the brain can lead to meningitis bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as mad cow disease is deadly in cattle and humans and is linked to prions kuru is a similar prionborne degenerative brain disease affecting humans endemic only to papua new guinea tribes both are linked to the ingestion of neural tissue and may explain the tendency in human and some nonhuman species to avoid cannibalism viral or bacterial causes have been reported in multiple sclerosis and are established causes of encephalopathy and encephalomyelitis brain tumors both benign and malignant can form these can either originate in the cerebral tissue or in the meninges the most common are those growths that affect the glial cells known as gliomas this term has been extended to include all primary brain tumors  secondary cancers can form in the brain as a result of brain metastasis mental disorders such as clinical depression schizophrenia bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder may involve particular patterns of neuropsychological functioning related to various aspects of mental and somatic function these disorders may be treated by psychotherapy psychiatric medication social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals many brain disorders are congenital occurring during development taysachs disease fragile x syndrome and down syndrome are all linked to genetic and chromosomal errors many other syndromes such as the intrinsic circadian rhythm disorders are suspected to be congenital as well normal development of the brain can be altered by genetic factors drug use nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases during pregnancy epileptic and nonepileptic seizures can cause cognitive impairment when the seizures become widespread occur repeatedly in the same brain area or last for too long seizures can be assessed using eeg and various medical imaging techniques they can sometimes be treated using anticonvulsant drugs and certain neurosurgical procedures and auxiliary treatments may also be used a key source of information about the function of brain regions is the effects of damage to them  in humans strokes have long provided a natural laboratory for studying the effects of brain damage most strokes result from a blood clot lodging in the brain and blocking the local blood supply causing damage or destruction of nearby brain tissue the range of possible blockages is very wide leading to a great diversity of stroke symptoms analysis of strokes is limited by the fact that damage often crosses into multiple regions of the brain not along clearcut borders making it difficult to draw firm conclusions transient ischemic attacks tias are ministrokes that can cause sudden dimming or loss of vision including amaurosis fugax speech impairment ranging from slurring to dysarthria or aphasia and mental confusion but unlike a stroke the symptoms of a tia can resolve within a few minutes or 24 hours brain injury may still occur in a tia lasting only a few minutes   a silent stroke or silent cerebral infarct sci differs from a tia in that there are no immediately observable symptoms an sci may still cause long lasting neurological dysfunction affecting such areas as mood personality and cognition an sci often occurs before or after a tia or major stroke  by placing electrodes on the scalp it is possible to record the summed electrical activity of the cortex using a methodology known as electroencephalography eeg  eeg records average neuronal activity from the cerebral cortex and can detect changes in activity over large areas but with low sensitivity for subcortical activity eeg recordings are sensitive enough to detect tiny electrical impulses lasting only a few milliseconds most eeg devices have good temporal resolution but low spatial resolution electrodes can also be placed directly on the surface of the brain usually during surgical procedures that require removal of part of the skull this technique called electrocorticography ecog offers finer spatial resolution than electroencephalography but is very invasive in addition to measuring the electric field directly via electrodes placed over the skull it is possible to measure the magnetic field that the brain generates using a method known as magnetoencephalography meg  this technique also has good temporal resolution like eeg but with much better spatial resolution the greatest disadvantage of meg is that because the magnetic fields generated by neural activity are very subtle the neural activity must be relatively close to the surface of the brain to detect its magnetic field megs can only detect the magnetic signatures of neurons located in the depths of cortical folds sulci that have dendrites oriented in a way that produces a field neuroscientists along with researchers from allied disciplines study how the human brain works such research has expanded considerably in recent decades the decade of the brain an initiative of the united states government in the 1990s is considered to have marked much of this increase in research  it has been followed in 2013 by the brain initiative information about the structure and function of the human brain comes from a variety of experimental methods most information about the cellular components of the brain and how they work comes from studies of animal subjects using techniques described in the brain article some techniques however are used mainly in humans and therefore are described here there are several methods for detecting brain activity changes using threedimensional imaging of local changes in blood flow the older methods are spect and pet which depend on injection of radioactive tracers into the bloodstream a newer method functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri has considerably better spatial resolution and involves no radioactivity  using the most powerful magnets currently available fmri can localize brain activity changes to regions as small as one cubic millimeter the downside is that the temporal resolution is poor when brain activity increases the blood flow response is delayed by 15seconds and lasts for at least 10seconds thus fmri is a very useful tool for learning which brain regions are involved in a given behavior but gives little information about the temporal dynamics of their responses a major advantage for fmri is that because it is noninvasive it can readily be used on human subjects another new noninvasive functional imaging method is functional nearinfrared spectroscopy function of animal and human brain with treatment of its malfunctioning diseases are described with simple logic like computer working  in the course of evolution of the homininae the human brain has grown in volume from about 600 cm  in homo habilis to about 1500cm  in homo sapiens neanderthalensis subsequently there has been a shrinking over the past 28000 years the male brain has decreased from 1500cm  to 1350cm  while the female brain has shrunk by the same relative proportion  for comparison homo erectus a relative of humans had a brain size of 1100cm  however the little homo floresiensis with a brain size of 380cm  a third of that of their proposed ancestor h erectus used fire hunted and made stone tools at least as sophisticated as those of h erectus  in spite of significant changes in social capacity there has been very little change in brain size from neanderthals to the present day  the notion as large as you need and as small as you can has been used to summarize the opposite evolutionary constraints on human brain size   changes in the size of the human brain during evolution have been reflected in changes in the aspm and microcephalin genes  studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations averaging around 03 to 04 between brain volume and iq  the most consistent associations are observed within the frontal temporal and parietal lobes the hippocampi and the cerebellum but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in iq which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and realworld performance    one study indicated that in humans fertility and intelligence tend to be negatively correlatedthat is to say the more intelligent as measured by iq exhibit a lower total fertility rate than the less intelligent according to the model the present rate of decline is predicted to be 134 iq points per decade

V brain morphometry is a subfield of both morphometry and the brain sciences concerned with the measurement of brain structures and changes thereof during development aging learning disease and evolution since autopsylike dissection is generally impossible on living brains brain morphometry starts with noninvasive neuroimaging data typically obtained from magnetic resonance imaging or mri for short these data are born digital which allows researchers to analyze the brain images further by using advanced mathematical and statistical methods such as shape quantification or multivariate analysis this allows researchers to quantify anatomical features of the brain in terms of shape mass volume eg of the hippocampus or of the primary versus secondary visual cortex and to derive more specific information such as the encephalization quotient grey matter density and white matter connectivity gyrification cortical thickness or the amount of cerebrospinal fluid these variables can then be mapped within the brain volume or on the brain surface providing a convenient way to assess their pattern and extent over time across individuals or even between different biological species the field is rapidly evolving along with neuroimaging techniques  which deliver the underlying data  but also develops in part independently from them as part of the emerging field of neuroinformatics which is concerned with developing and adapting algorithms to analyze those data   the term brain mapping is often used interchangeably with brain morphometry although mapping in the narrower sense of projecting properties of the brain onto a template brain is strictly speaking only a subfield of brain morphometry on the other hand though much more rarely neuromorphometry is also sometimes used as a synonym for brain morphometry particularly in the earlier literature eg haug 1986 though technically is only one of its subfields the morphology and function of a complex organ like the brain are the result of numerous biochemical and biophysical processes interacting in a highly complex manner across multiple scales in space and time vallender et al 2008 most of the genes known to control these processes during brain development maturation and aging are highly conserved holland 2003 though some show polymorphisms cf meda et al 2008 and pronounced differences at the cognitive level abound even amongst closely related species or between individuals within a species roth and dicke 2005 in contrast variations in macroscopic brain anatomy ie at a level of detail still discernible by the naked human eye are sufficiently conserved to allow for comparative analyses yet diverse enough to reflect variations within and between individuals and species as morphological analyses that compare brains at different ontogenetic or pathogenic stages can reveal important information about the progression of normal or abnormal development within a given species crossspecies comparative studies have a similar potential to reveal evolutionary trends and phylogenetic relationships given that the imaging modalities commonly employed for brain morphometric investigations are essentially of a molecular or even subatomic nature a number of factors may interfere with derived quantification of brain structures these include all of the parameters mentioned in applications but also the state of hydration hormonal status medication and substance abuse there are two major prerequisites for brain morphometry first the brain features of interest must be measurable and second statistical methods have to be in place to compare the measurements quantitatively shape feature comparisons form the basis of linnaean taxonomy and even in cases of convergent evolution or brain disorders they still provide a wealth of information about the nature of the processes involved shape comparisons have long been constrained to simple and mainly volume or slicebased measures but profited enormously from the digital revolution as now all sorts of shapes in any number of dimensions can be handled numerically in addition though the extraction of morphometric parameters like brain mass or liquor volume may be relatively straightforward in post mortem samples most studies in living subjects will by necessity have to use an indirect approach a spatial representation of the brain or its components is obtained by some appropriate neuroimaging technique and the parameters of interest can then be analyzed on that basis such a structural representation of the brain is also a prerequisite for the interpretation of functional neuroimaging the design of a brain morphometric study depends on multiple factors that can be roughly categorized as follows first depending on whether ontogenetic pathological or phylogenetic issues are targeted the study can be designed as longitudinal within the same brain measured at different times crosssectional across brains second brain image data can be acquired using different neuroimaging modalities third brain properties can be analyzed at different scales eg in the whole brain regions of interest cortical or subcortical structures fourth the data can be subjected to different kinds of processing and analysis steps brain morphometry as a discipline is mainly concerned with the development of tools addressing this fourth point and integration with the previous ones with the exception of the usually slicebased histology of the brain neuroimaging data are generally stored as matrices of voxels the most popular morphometric method thus is known as voxelbased morphometry vbm cf wright et al 1995 ashburner and friston 2000 good et al 2001 yet as an imaging voxel is not a biologically meaningful unit other approaches have been developed that potentially bear a closer correspondence to biological structures deformationbased morphometry dbm surfacebased morphometry sbm and fiber tracking based on diffusionweighted imaging dti or dsi all four are usually performed based on magnetic resonance mr imaging data with the former three commonly using t1weighted eg magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo mprage and sometimes t2weighted pulse sequences while dtidsi use diffusionweighted ones however recent evaluation of morphometry algorithmssoftware demonstrates inconsistency among several of them  this renders a need for systematic and quantitative validation and evaluation of the field mr images are generated by a complex interaction between static and dynamic electromagnetic fields and the tissue of interest namely the brain that is encapsulated in the head of the subject hence the raw images contain noise from various sourcesnamely head movements a scan suitable for morphometry typically takes on the order of 10 min that can hardly be corrected or modeled and bias fields neither of the electromagnetic fields involved is homogeneous across the whole head nor brain which can be modeled in the following the image is segmented into nonbrain and brain tissue with the latter usually being subsegmented into at least gray matter gm white matter wm and cerebrospinal fluid since image voxels near the class boundaries do not generally contain just one kind of tissue partial volume effects ensue that can be corrected for for comparisons across different scans within or across subjects differences in brain size and shape are eliminated by spatially normalizing ie registering the individual images to the stereotactic space of a template brain registration can be performed using lowresolution ie rigidbody or affine transformations or highresolution ie highly nonlinear methods and templates can be generated from the studys pool of brains from a brain atlas or a derived template generator both the registered images and the deformation fields generated upon registration can be used for morphometric analyses thereby providing the basis for voxelbased morphometry vbm and deformationbased morphometry dbm images segmented into tissue classes can also be used to convert segmentation boundaries into parametric surfaces the analysis of which is the focus of surfacebased morphometry sbm after the individual images are segmented they are registered to the template each voxel then contains a measure of the probability according to which it belongs to a specific segmentation class for gray matter this quantity is usually referred to as gray matter density gmd or gray matter concentration gmc or gray matter probability gmp in order to correct for the volume changes due to the registration the gray matter volume gmv in the original brain can be calculated by multiplying the gmd with the jacobian determinants of the deformations used to register the brain to the template classspecific volumes for wm and csf are defined analogously the local differences in the density or volume of the different segmentation classes can then be statistically analyzed across scans and interpreted in anatomical terms eg as gray matter atrophy since vbm is available for many of the major neuroimaging software packages eg fsl and spm it provides an efficient tool to test or generate specific hypotheses about brain changes over time it is noteworthy that unlike dbm considerable criticism and words of caution regarding the correct interpretation of vbm results has been leveled by the medical image computing community    in dbm highly nonlinear registration algorithms are used and the statistical analyses are not performed on the registered voxels but on the deformation fields used to register them which requires multivariate approaches or derived scalar properties thereof which allows for univariate approaches one common variantsometimes referred to as tensorbased morphometry tbmis based on the jacobian determinant of the deformation matrix of course multiple solutions exist for such nonlinear warping procedures and to balance appropriately between the potentially opposing requirements for global and local shape fit ever more sophisticated registration algorithms are being developed most of these however are computationally expensive if applied with a highresolution grid the biggest advantage of dbm with respect to vbm is its ability to detect subtle changes in longitudinal studies however due to the vast variety of registration algorithms no widely accepted standard for dbm exists which also prevented its incorporation into major neuroimaging software packages pattern based morphometry pbm is a method of brain morphometry first put forth in pbm  it builds upon dbm and vbm pbm is based on the application of sparse dictionary learning to morphometry as opposed to typical voxel based approaches which depend on univariate statistical tests at specific voxel locations pbm extracts multivariate patterns directly from the entire image the advantage of this is that the inferences are not made locally as in vbm or dbm but globally this allows the method to detect if combinations of voxels are better suited to separate the groups being studied rather than single voxels also the method is more robust to variations in the underlying registration algorithms as compared to typical dbm analysis once the brain is segmented the boundary between different classes of tissue can be reconstructed as a surface on which morphometric analysis can proceed eg towards gyrification or onto which results of such analyses can be projected nerve fibertracking techniques are the latest offspring of this suite of mrbased morphological approaches they determine the tract of nerve fibers within the brain by means of diffusion tensor imaging or diffusionspectrum imaging eg douaud et al 2007 and odonnell et al 2009 the qualitatively largest changes within an individual generally occur during early development and more subtle ones during aging and learning while pathological changes can vary highly in their extent and interindividual differences increase both during and across lifetimes the abovedescribed morphometric methods provide the means to analyze such changes quantitatively and mr imaging has been applied to ever more brain populations relevant to these time scales both within humans and across species currently however most applications of mrbased brain morphometry have a clinical focus ie they help to diagnose and monitor neuropsychiatric disorders in particular neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimer or psychotic disorders like schizophrenia mr imaging is rarely performed during pregnancy and the neonatal period in order to avoid stress for mother and child in the cases of birth complications and other clinical events however such data are being acquired for instance dubois et al 2008 analyzed gyrification in premature newborns at birth and found it to be predictive of a functional score at termequivalent age and serag et al  built a 4d atlas of the developing neonatal brain which has led to the construction of brain growth curves from 2844 weeks postmenstrual age beyond preterms there have been a number of largescale longitudinal mrmorphometric studies often combined with crosssectional approaches and other neuroimaging modalities of normal brain development in humans using voxelbased and a number of complementary approaches these studies revealed or noninvasively confirmed from the perspective of previous histological studies which cannot be longitudinal that brain maturation involves differential growth of gray and white matter that the time course of the maturation is not linear and that it differs markedly across brain regions in order to interpret these findings cellular processes have to be taken into consideration especially those governing the pruning of axons dendrites and synapses until an adult pattern of wholebrain connectivity is achieved which can best be monitored using diffusionweighted techniques while white matter increases throughout early development and adolescence and gray matter decreases in that period generally do not involve neuronal cell bodies the situation is different beyond the age of about 50 years when atrophy affects gray and possibly also white matter the most convincing explanation for this is that individual neurons die leading to the loss of both their cell bodies ie gray matter and their myelinated axons ie white matter the gray matter changes can be observed via both gray matter density and gyrification that the white matter loss is not nearly as clear as that for gray matter indicates that changes also occur in nonneural tissue eg the vasculature or microglia perhaps the most profound impact to date of brain morphometry on our understanding of the relationships between brain structure and function has been provided by a series of vbm studies targeted at proficiency in various performances licensed taxicab drivers in london were found to exhibit bilaterally increased gray matter volume in the posterior part of the hippocampus both relative to controls from the general population and to london bus drivers matched for driving experience and stress levels similarly gray matter changes were also found to correlate with professional experience in musicians mathematicians and meditators and with second language proficiency what is more bilateral gray matter changes in the posterior and lateral parietal cortex of medical students memorizing for an intermediate exam could be detected over a period of just three months these studies of professional training inspired questions about the limits of mrbased morphometry in terms of time periods over which structural brain changes can be detected important determinants of these limits are the speed and spatial extent of the changes themselves of course some events like accidents a stroke a tumor metastasis or a surgical intervention can profoundly change brain structure during very short periods and these changes can be visualized with mr and other neuroimaging techniques given the time constraints under such conditions brain morphometry is rarely involved in diagnostics but rather used for progress monitoring over periods of weeks and months and longer one study found that juggling novices showed a bilateral gray matter expansion in the medial temporal visual area also known as v5 over a threemonth period during which they had learned to sustain a threeball cascade for at least a minute no changes were observed in a control group that did not engage in juggling the extent of these changes in the jugglers reduced during a subsequent threemonth period in which they did not practice juggling to further resolve the time course of these changes the experiment was repeated with another young cohort scanned in shorter intervals and the by then typical changes in v5 could already be found after just seven days of juggling practice interestingly the observed changes were larger in the initial learning phase than during continued training whereas the former two studies involved students in their early twenties the experiments were recently repeated with an elderly cohort revealing the same kind of structural changes although attenuated by lower juggling performance of this group using a completely different kind of interventionapplication of transcranial magnetic stimulation in daily sessions over five dayschanges were observedin and near the tms target areas as well as in the basal ganglia of volunteers in their midtwenties compared to a control group that had received placeboic tms treatment it is possible though that these changes simply reflect vascularization effects taken together these morphometric studies strongly support the notion that brain plasticitychanges of brain structureremains possible throughout life and may well be an adaptation to changes in brain function which has also been shown to change with experience the title of this section was meant to emphasize this namely that plasticity and learning provide two perspectivesfunctional and structuralat the same phenomenon a brain that changes over time brain diseases are the field to which brain morphometry is most often applied and the volume of the literature on this is vast brain changes also accumulate over periods longer than an individual life but even though twin studies have established that human brain structure is highly heritable brain morphometric studies with such a broadened scope are rare however in the context of disorders with a known or suspected hereditary component a number of studies have compared the brain morphometry of patients with both that of nonaffected controls and that of subjects at high risk for developing the disorder the latter group usually includes family members even larger time gaps can be bridged by comparing human populations with a sufficiently long history of genetic separation such as central europeans and japanese one surfacebased study compared the brain shape between these two groups and found a difference in their genderdependent brain asymmetries neuroimaging studies of this kind combined with functional ones and behavioural data provide promising and so far largely unexplored avenues to understand similarities and differences between different groups of people like morphological analyses that compare brains at different ontogenetic or pathogenetic stages can reveal important information about normal or abnormal development within a given species crossspecies comparative studies have a similar potential to reveal evolutionary trends and phylogenetic relationships indeed shape comparisons though historically with an emphasis on qualitative criteria formed the basis of biological taxonomy before the era of genetics three principal sources exist for comparative evolutionary investigations fossils freshpreserved postmortem or in vivo studies the fossil record is dominated by structures that were already biomineralized during the lifetime of the respective organism in the case of vertebrates mainly teeth and bones brains like other soft tissues rarely fossilize but occasionally they do the probably oldest vertebrate brain known today belonged to a ratfish that lived around 300 million years ago pradel et al 2009 while the technique most widely used to image fossils is computed tomography ct this particular specimen was imaged by synchrotron tomography and recent mr imaging studies with fossils suggest that the method may be used to image at least a subset of fossilized brains mr images have also been obtained from the brain of a 3200yearold egyptian mummy the perspectives are slim however that any threedimensional imaging dataset of a fossil semifossil or mummified brain will ever be of much use to morphometric analyses of the kind described here since the processes of mummification and fossilization heavily alter the structure of soft tissues in a way specific to the individual specimen and subregions therein postmortem samples of living or recently extinct species on the other hand generally allow to obtain mr image qualities sufficient for morphometric analyses though preservation artifacts would have to be taken into account previous mr imaging studies include specimens preserved in formalin by freezing or in alcohol  the third line of comparative evidence would be crossspecies in vivo mr imaging studies like the one by rilling  insel 1998 who investigated brains from eleven primate species by vbm in order to shed new light on primate brain evolution other studies have combined morphometric with behavioural measures and brain evolution does not only concern primates gyrification occurs across mammalian brains if they reach a size of several centimeterswith cetaceans dominating the upper end of the spectrumand generally increases slowly with overall brain size following a power law

V the thymus is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system within the thymus t cells or t lymphocytes mature t cells are critical to the adaptive immune system where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders the thymus is composed of two identical lobes and is located anatomically in the anterior superior mediastinum in front of the heart and behind the sternum histologically each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central medulla and a peripheral cortex which is surrounded by an outer capsule the cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of tcells cells in the thymus can be divided into thymic stromal cells and cells of hematopoietic origin derived from bone marrow resident hematopoietic stem cells developing tcells are referred to as thymocytes and are of hematopoietic origin stromal cells include epithelial cells of the thymic cortex and medulla and dendritic cells the thymus provides an inductive environment for development of t cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells in addition thymic stromal cells allow for the selection of a functional and selftolerant t cell repertoire therefore one of the most important roles of the thymus is the induction of central tolerance the thymus is largest and most active during the neonatal and preadolescent periods by the early teens the thymus begins to atrophy and thymic stroma is mostly replaced by adipose fat tissue nevertheless residual t lymphopoiesis continues throughout adult life   the thymus is of a pinkishgray color soft and lobulated on its surfaces at birth it is about 5cm in length 4cm in breadth and about 6mm in thickness  the organ enlarges during childhood and atrophies at puberty unlike the liver kidney and heart for instance the thymus is at its largest in children the thymus reaches maximum weight 20 to 37grams by the time of puberty the thymus of older people is scarcely distinguishable from surrounding fatty tissue as one ages the thymus slowly shrinks eventually degenerating into tiny islands of fatty tissue by the age of 75 years the thymus weighs only 6grams in children the thymus is grayishpink in colour and in adults it is yellow if examined when its growth is most active the thymus will be found to consist of two lateral lobes placed in close contact along the middle line situated partly in the thorax partly in the neck and extending from the fourth costal cartilage upward as high as the lower border of the thyroid gland it is covered by the sternum and by the origins of the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles  below it rests upon the pericardium being separated from the aortic arch and great vessels by a layer of fascia in the neck it lies on the front and sides of the trachea behind the sternohyoidei and sternothyreoidei the two lobes differ slightly in size and may be united or separated  each lateral lobe is composed of numerous lobules held together by delicate areolar tissue the entire organ being enclosed in an investing capsule  of a similar but denser structure the primary lobules vary in size from that of a pins head to that of a small pea and are made up of a number of small nodules or follicles the follicles are irregular in shape and are more or less fused together especially toward the interior of the organ each follicle is from 1 to 2mm in diameter and consists of a medullary and a cortical portion  and these differ in many essential particulars from each other the cortical portion is mainly composed of lymphocytes supported by a network of finelybranched epithelial reticular cells which is continuous with a similar network in the medullary portion this network forms an adventitia to the blood vessels the cortex is the location of the earliest events in thymocyte development where t cell receptor gene rearrangement and positive selection takes place in the medullary portion the network of reticular cells is coarser than in the cortex the lymphoid cells are relatively fewer in number and there are concentric nestlike bodies called hassalls corpusclesthese concentric corpuscles are composed of a central mass consisting of one or more granular cells and of a capsule formed of epithelial cells they are the remains of the epithelial tubes which grow out from the third pharyngeal pouches of the embryo to form the thymus  each follicle is surrounded by a vascular plexus from which vessels pass into the interior and radiate from the periphery toward the center forming a second zone just within the margin of the medullary portion in the center of the medullary portion there are very few vessels and they are of minute size the medulla is the location of the latter events in thymocyte development thymocytes that reach the medulla have already successfully undergone t cell receptor gene rearrangement and positive selection and have been exposed to a limited degree of negative selection the medulla is specialised to allow thymocytes to undergo additional rounds of negative selection to remove autoreactive tcells from the mature repertoire the gene aire is expressed by the thymic medullary epithelium and drives the transcription of organspecific genes such as insulin to allow maturing thymocytes to be exposed to a more complex set of selfantigens than is present in the cortex the arteries supplying the thymus are derived from the internal thoracic artery and from the superior thyroid artery and inferior thyroids the veins end in the left brachiocephalic vein innominate vein and in the thyroid veins the nerves are exceedingly minute they are derived from the vagi and sympathetic nervous system branches from the descendens hypoglossi and phrenic reach the investing capsule but do not penetrate into the substance of the organ the two main components of the thymus the lymphoid thymocytes and the thymic epithelial cells have distinct developmental origins the thymic epithelium is the first to develop and appears in the form of two flaskshape endodermal diverticula which arise one on either side from the third pharyngeal pouch and extend lateralward and backward into the surrounding mesoderm and neural crestderived mesenchyme in front of the ventral aorta here the thymocytes and epithelium meet and join with connective tissue the pharyngeal opening of each diverticulum is soon obliterated but the neck of the flask persists for some time as a cellular cord by further proliferation of the cells lining the flask buds of cells are formed which become surrounded and isolated by the invading mesoderm additional portions of thymus tissue are sometimes developed from the fourth pharyngeal pouch  during the late stages of the development of the thymic epithelium hematopoietic bonemarrow precursors migrate into the thymus normal thymic development thereafter is dependent on the interaction between the thymic epithelium and the hematopoietic thymocytes the thymus continues to grow between birth and puberty and then begins to atrophy this thymic involution is directed by the high levels of circulating hormones proportional to thymic size thymic activity tcell output is most active before puberty upon atrophy the size and activity are dramatically reduced and the organ is primarily replaced with fat a phenomenon known as organ involution the atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of sex hormones and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity  patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis commonly 70 are found to have thymic hyperplasia or malignancy  the reason or order of these circumstances has yet to be determined a thymus may be transplanted however it is problematic due to donor requirements and matching tissue with the patient a fully functional thymus has been grown in mice by taking fibroblasts from mouse embryos and reprogram these cells to be thymic epithelial cells which were then grown attached onto mice kidneys and became fully functional thymus  in the two thymic lobes hematopoietic precursors from the bonemarrow referred to as thymocytes mature into tcells once mature tcells emigrate from the thymus and constitute the peripheral tcell repertoire responsible for directing many facets of the adaptive immune system loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation as in digeorge syndrome  results in severe immunodeficiency and subsequent high susceptibility to infection  each t cell attacks a specific foreign substance which it identifies with its receptor t cells have receptors which are generated by randomly shuffling gene segments each t cell attacks a different antigen t cells that attack the bodys own proteins are eliminated in the thymus thymic epithelial cells express major proteins from elsewhere in the body first t cells undergo positive selection whereby the cell comes in contact with selfmhc expressed by thymic epithelial cells those with no interaction are destroyed second the t cell undergoes negative selection by interacting with thymic dendritic cells whereby t cells with high affinity interaction are eliminated through apoptosis to avoid autoimmunity and those with intermediate affinity survive the stock of tlymphocytes is built up in early life so the function of the thymus is diminished in adults it is largely degenerated in elderly adults and is barely identifiable consisting mostly of fatty tissue but it continues its endocrine function  involution of the thymus has been linked to loss of immune function in the elderly susceptibility to infection and to cancer the ability of t cells to recognize foreign antigens is mediated by the tcell receptor the tcell receptor undergoes genetic rearrangement during thymocyte maturation resulting in each tcell bearing a unique tcell receptor specific to a limited set of peptidemhc combinations the random nature of the genetic rearrangement results in a requirement of central tolerance mechanisms to remove or inactivate those t cells which bear a tcell receptor with the ability to recognise selfpeptides in order to be positivelyselected thymocytes will have to interact with several cell surface molecules mhchla to ensure reactivity and specificity  positive selection eliminates by apoptosis weaklybinding cells and only takes strongly or mediumbinding cells binding refers to the ability of the tcell receptors to bind to either mhc class iii or peptide molecules negative selection is not 100 complete some autoreactive tcells escape thymic censorship and are released into the circulation additional mechanisms of tolerance active in the periphery exist to silence these cells such as anergy deletion and regulatory t cells if these peripheral tolerance mechanisms also fail autoimmunity may arise cells that pass both levels of selection are released into the bloodstream to perform vital immune functions the immune system is a multicomponent interactive system it effectively protects the host from various infections an improperly functioning immune system can cause discomfort disease or even death the type of malfunction falls into one or more of the following major groups hypersensitivity or allergy autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency allergy results from an inappropriate and excessive immune response to common antigens substances that trigger an allergic response are called allergens allergies involve mainly ige antibodies and histamine mast cells release the histamine sometimes an allergen may cause a sudden and severe possibly fatal reaction in a sensitive individual this is called anaphylaxis as the thymus is the organ of tcell development any congenital defect in thymic genesis or a defect in thymocyte development can lead to a profound t cell deficiency in primary immunodeficiency disease defects that affect both the t cell and b cell lymphocyte lineages result in severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome scids acquired t cell deficiencies can also affect thymocyte development in the thymus digeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the deletion of a small section of chromosome 22 this results in a midline congenital defect including thymic aplasia or congenital deficiency of a thymus patients may present with a profound immunodeficiency disease due to the lack of t cells no other immune cell lineages are affected by the congenital absence of the thymus digeorge syndrome is the most common congenital cause of thymic aplasia in humans in mice the nude mouse strain are congenitally thymic deficient these mice are an important model of primary t cell deficiency severe combined immunodeficiency syndromes scid are group of rare congenital genetic diseases that result in combined t lymphocyte and b lymphocyte deficiencies these syndromes are caused by defective hematopoietic progenitor cells which are the precursors of both b and tcells this results in a severe reduction in developing thymocytes in the thymus and consequently thymic atrophy a number of genetic defects can cause scid including il7 receptor deficiency common gamma chain deficiency and recombination activating gene deficiency the gene that codes for the enzyme called ada adenine deaminase is located on chromosomes 20 the hiv virus causes an acquired tcell immunodeficiency syndrome aids by specifically killing cd4  tcells whereas the major effect of the virus is on mature peripheral tcells hiv can also infect developing thymocytes in the thymus most of which express cd4 autoimmune diseases are caused by a hyperactive immune system that instead of attacking foreign pathogens reacts against the host organism self causing disease one of the primary functions of the thymus is to prevent autoimmunity through the process of central tolerance immunologic tolerance to self antigens autoimmune polyendocrinopathycandidiasisectodermal dystrophy apeced is an extremely rare genetic autoimmune syndrome however this disease highlights the importance of the thymus in prevention of autoimmunity this disease is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator aire gene  aire allows for the ectopic expression of tissuespecific proteins in the thymus medulla such as proteins that would normally only be expressed in the eye or pancreas this expression in the thymus allows for the deletion of autoreactive thymocytes by exposing them to selfantigens during their development a mechanism of central tolerance patients with apeced develop an autoimmune disease that affects multiple endocrine tissues myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors myasthenia gravis is often associated with thymic hypertrophy thymectomy may be necessary to treat the disease two primary forms of tumours originate in the thymus tumours originating from the thymic epithelial cells are called thymomas and are found in about 1015 of patients with myasthenia gravis  symptoms are sometimes confused with bronchitis or a strong cough because the tumour presses on the recurrent laryngeal nerve all thymomas are potentially cancerous but they can vary a great deal some grow very slowly others grow rapidly and can spread to surrounding tissues treatment of thymomas often requires surgery to remove the entire thymus tumours originating from the thymocytes are called thymic lymphomas  lymphomas or leukemias of thymocyte origin are classified as precursor t acute lymphoblastic leukemialymphoma tall people with an enlarged thymus particularly children were treated with intense radiation in the years before 1950 there is an elevated incidence of thyroid cancer and leukemia in treated individuals  cervical thymus is a rare malformation thymic tissue containing cysts is rarely described in the literature ectopic glandular tissue included in the wall of cystic formation can trigger a series of problems similar to those of thymus  thymic cysts are uncommon lesions about 150 cases being found while thymic cyst and ectopic cervical thymus are identified most frequently in childhood the mean age at which thymoma is diagnosed is 45 years however studies have shown the existence necroptic thymic tissue masses in the neck asymptomatic intravital more frequently the incidence reaching nearly 30 these observations may mean absence of clinical observation  thymectomy is the surgical removal of the thymus the usual reason for a thymectomy is to gain access to the heart for surgery to correct congenital heart defects in the neonatal period in neonates but not older children or adults the relative size of the thymus obstructs surgical access to the heart removal of the thymus in infancy results in immunodeficiency by some measures although t cells develop compensating function and it remains unknown whether disease incidence in later life is significantly greater     this is because sufficient t cells are generated during fetal life prior to birth these t cells are longlived and can proliferate by homeostatic proliferation throughout the lifetime of the patient however there is evidence of premature immune aging in patients thymectomized during early childhood  other indications for thymectomy include the removal of thymomas and the treatment of myasthenia gravis thymectomy is not indicated for the treatment of primary thymic lymphomas however a thymic biopsy may be necessary to make the pathologic diagnosis  when used for consumption animal thymic tissue is known as one of the kinds of sweetbread the thymus was known to the ancient greeks and its name comes from the greek word \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 thumos meaning anger  or heart soul desire life possibly because of its location in the chest near where emotions are subjectively felt or else the name comes from the herb thyme also in greek \u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 or \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9 which became the name for a warty excrescence possibly due to its resemblance to a bunch of thyme   additionally the thymus closely resembles the shape of the letter t this may also be a possibility for the origin of the name of the organ galen was the first to note that the size of the organ changed over the duration of a persons life  in the nineteenth century a fictitious condition known as status thymicolymphaticus an enlarged thymus was erroneously thought to be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome causing physicians to recommend radiation therapy as a treatment a practice that continued into the 1950s  due to the large numbers of apoptotic lymphocytes the thymus was originally dismissed as a lymphocyte graveyard without functional importance the importance of the thymus in the immune system was discovered in 1961 by jacques miller by surgically removing the thymus from one day old mice and observing the subsequent deficiency in a lymphocyte population subsequently named tcells after the organ of their origin   recently advances in immunology have allowed the function of the thymus in tcell maturation to be more fully understood  the thymus is present in all jawed vertebrates where it undergoes the same shrinkage with age and plays the same immunological function as in human beings recently a discrete thymuslike lymphoepithelial structure termed the thymoid was discovered in the gills of larval lampreys  hagfish possess a protothymus associated with the pharyngeal velar muscles which is responsible for a variety of immune responses  little is known about the immune mechanisms of tunicates  or of amphioxus the thymus is also present in most vertebrates with similar structure and function as the human thymus some animals have multiple secondary smaller thymi in the neck this phenomenon has been reported for mice  and also occurs in 5 out of 6 human fetuses  as in humans the guinea pigs thymus naturally atrophies as the animal reaches adulthood but the athymic hairless guinea pig which arose from a spontaneous

V synaptic fatigue or shortterm synaptic depression is an activitydependent form of short term synaptic plasticity that results in the temporary inability of neurons to fire and therefore transmit an input signal it is thought to be a form of negative feedback in order to physiologically control particular forms of nervous system activity  it is caused by a temporary depletion of synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters in the synapse generally produced by persistent high frequency neuronal stimulation the neurotransmitters are released by the synapse to propagate the signal to the postsynaptic cell it has also been hypothesized that synaptic fatigue could be a result of postsynaptic receptor desensitization or changes in postsynaptic passive conductance but recent evidence has suggested that it is primarily a presynaptic phenomenon     chemical synapses allow for signal transmission by a presynaptic cell releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse to bind to receptors on a postsynaptic cell these neurotransmitters are synthesized in the presynaptic cell and housed in vesicles until released once neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft and a signal is relayed reuptake begins which is the process of transport proteins clearing out the neurotransmitters from the synapse and recycling them in order to allow for a new signal to be propagated if stimulation is occurring at a high enough frequency and with enough strength neurotransmitters will be released at a faster rate than reuptake can recycle them which will ultimately deplete them until there are no longer readily releasable vesicles and a signal can no longer be transmitted it has previously been shown that repeated short trains of action potentials causes an exponential decay of the synaptic response amplitudes in the neurons of many neural networks specifically the caudal pontine reticular nucleus pnc recent research has suggested that only repeated burst stimulation as opposed to single or paired pulse stimulation at a very high frequency can result in sf  some cells like aortic baroreceptor neurons could have devastating effects including the inability to regulate aortic blood pressure if the onset of synaptic fatigue were to affect them metabotropic glutamate autoreceptor activation in these neurons may inhibit synaptic transmission by inhibiting calcium influx decreasing synaptic vesicle exocytosis and modulating the mechanisms governing synaptic vesicle recovery and endocytosis  these glutamate autoreceptors are able to inhibit synaptic fatigue in order to prevent the detrimental physiological consequences that could result from dysfunctional blood pressure regulation in the aorta when synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse that bind with postsynaptic membrane proteins to pass a signal neurotransmitter reuptake occurs to recycle neurotransmitters in the presynaptic cell in order to be released again neurotransmitter vesicles are recycled through the process of endocytosis because each presynaptic cell can link up to thousands of connections with other neurons synaptic fatigue and its recovery can cause interactions with other neuronal circuits and can affect the kinetics with other processes of neurons  it is important that the recycling of neurotransmitters take place at an effective and efficient rate in order to prevent synaptic fatigue from negatively affecting signal transmission maintaining a readily releasable vesicle pool is important in allowing for the constant ability to pass physiological signals between neurons the timing it takes for neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft and then be recycled back to the presynaptic cell to be reused is not currently well understood there are two models currently proposed to attempt to understand this process one model predicts that the vesicle undergoes complete fusion with the presynaptic cellular membrane once all its contents have been emptied it then must retrieve vesicular membrane from other sites which could take up to tens of seconds  the second model tries to explain this phenomenon by assuming the vesicles immediately begin to recycle neurotransmitters after release which takes less than a second to complete endocytosis  one study showed varying times of complete endocytosis ranging from 55389 seconds it also indicated that these times were completely independent of long term or chronic activity  synaptic fatigue can affect many synapses of many different types of neurons  the existence and observations of synaptic fatigue are accepted universally although the exact mechanisms underlying the phenomenon are not completely understood it is generally seen in mature cells at high frequencies of stimuli 1hz one specific example is that the gill withdrawal reflex of the aplysia is caused by homosynaptic depression  although homosynaptic and heterosynaptic depression can lead to longterm depression andor potentiation this particular case is a shortterm example of how homosynaptic depression causes synaptic fatigue perforant pathgranule cells ppgc in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in adult rats have been shown to experience fatigue at lower frequencies 00502hz  in the developing rat ppgcs two types of synaptic plasticity were shown to lead to synaptic fatigue a low frequency reversible depression of presynaptic vesicle release and a form of nonreversible depression caused by ampa silencing the second form of plasticity disappears with maturation of ppgcs although the reversible low frequency depression remains unchanged  synaptic vesicles are thought to be part of three distinct pools the readily releasable pool comprises approximately 5 of total vesicles the recycling pool about 15 and the reserve pool the remaining 80  the reserve pool seems to only begin to release vesicles in response to intense stimulation there have been several studies that suggest the reserve vesicles are seldom ever released in response to physiological stimuli which raises questions about their importance  this release in vesicles regardless of which pool they are released from is considered a form of short term synaptic plasticity because it is changing the functional characteristics of the presynaptic cell ultimately temporarily altering its firing properties the difference between this and longterm potentiation is the fact that this phenomenon only occurs for the duration of time it takes to recycle and reuse neurotransmitters as opposed to it occurring over the longterm such as the characteristics underlying longterm potentiation further research should be conducted to identify the importance of the reserve pool vesicles in presynaptic cells synaptic fatigue has not been shown to directly cause or result in a central nervous system pathology although the degrees at which it is activated in cells has been studied as result of particular pathologies and diseases longterm changes in a neuron or synapse resulting in a permanent change in a neurons excitatory properties can cause synaptic fatigue to occur from much more or less activation that could potentially lead to some sort of physiological abnormality hallmarks of alzheimers disease ad are impairment of cognition aggregation of \u03b2amyloid peptide a\u03b2 neurofibrillary degeneration loss of neurons with accelerated atrophy of specific brain areas and decrease of synapse number in surviving neurons research indicates both pre and postsynaptic mechanisms resulting in ad one specific abnormality includes an increased amount of presynaptic protein app a study was conducted where synaptic fatigue was compared between transgenic mice overexpressing appps1 with their littermates who did not overexpress the protein the results showed that fatigue was more significantly pronounced in the appps1 mice which indicates a decrease in the amount of readily releasable pools of vesicles in the presynaptic neuron conclusions from this study include synaptic fatigue being primarily a presynaptic phenomenon and not being affected by postsynaptic receptor desensitization synaptic fatigue is not a result of ca  ions building up in the terminal and most importantly that synaptic fatigue is an important player and can be studied when researching the causes and effects of some neurodegenerative diseases  antidepressants have shortterm and longterm effects in depressed patients the shortterm effects are explained by a hypothesis that states that depression is acutely brought on by an immediate decrease in catecholamines in the brain antidepressants act immediately to inhibit this decrease and restore normal levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain under stressed conditions vesicle exocytosis is potentiated and a release of catecholamines causes depression of presynaptic cells because of depleted neurotransmitters therapeutic doses of fluoxetine have been shown to decrease these neuronal fatigue states by inhibiting vesicle release and thereby preventing synaptic fatigue in hippocampal neurons these findings show that fluoxetine as well as other antidepressants that act through the same mechanisms as fluoxetine enhance neurorecovery and neurotransmission to reduce the risk of depression

V a forked tongue is a tongue split into two distinct tines at the tip this is a feature common to many species of reptiles reptiles smell using the tip of their tongue and a forked tongue allows them to sense from which direction a smell is coming sensing from both sides of the head and following trails based on chemical cues is called tropotaxis  it is unclear whether forkedtongued reptiles can actually follow trails or if this is just a hypothesis    forked tongues have evolved in these squamate reptiles lizards and snakes for various purposes the advantage to having a forked tongue is that more surface area is available for the chemicals to contact and the potential for tropotaxis  the tongue is flicked out of the mouth regularly to sample the chemical environment this form of chemical sampling allows these animals to sense nonvolatile chemicals which cannot be detected by simply using the olfactory system    this increased ability to sense chemicals has allowed for heightened abilities to identify prey recognize kin choose mates locate shelters follow trails and more  forked tongues have evolved multiple times in squamates it is unclear based on the morphological and genetic evidence where the exact points of change are from a notched tongue to a forked tongue but it is believed that the change has happened two to four times   a common behavioral characteristic that has evolved in those with forked tongues is that they tend to be wide foragers   hummingbirds also have tongues that split at the tip  galagos bushbabies have a secondary tongue or sublingua used for grooming hidden under their first    the phrase speaks with a forked tongue means to deliberately say one thing and mean another or to be hypocritical or act in a duplicitous manner in the longstanding tradition of many native american tribes speaking with a forked tongue has meant lying and a person was no longer considered worthy of trust once he had been shown to speak with a forked tongue this phrase was also adopted by americans around the time of the revolution and may be found in abundant references from the early 19th century  often reporting on american officers who sought to convince the tribal leaders with whom they negotiated that they spoke with a straight and not with a forked tongue as for example president andrew jackson told the creek nation in 1829  according to one 1859 account the native proverb that the white man spoke with a forked tongue originated as a result of the french tactic of the 1690s in their war with the iroquois of inviting their enemies to attend a peace conference only to be slaughtered or captured  there are appearances of the phrase forked tongue in english literature either in reference to actual snakes tongues or as a metaphor for untruthfulness such as a sermon by lancelot andrewes who died in 1626 and he hath the art of cleaving he shewed it in the beginning when he made the serpent lingnam bisulcam a forked tongue to speake that which was contrary to his knowledge and meaning they should not die and as hee did the serpents so hee can doe others  the phrase also appears in miltons paradise lost according to his doom he would have spoke but hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue to forked tongue for now were all transformd

V paleoneurology is the study of brain evolution by analysis of brain endocasts to determine endocranial traits and volumes considered a subdivision of neuroscience paleoneurology combines techniques from other fields of study including paleontology and archaeology it reveals specific insight concerning human evolution the cranium is unique in that it grows in response to the growth of brain tissue rather than genetic guidance as is the case with bones that support movement fossil skulls and their endocasts can be compared to each other to the skulls and fossils of recently deceased individuals and even compared to those of other species to make inferences about functional anatomy physiology and phylogeny paleoneurology is in large part influenced by developments in neuroscience as a whole without substantial knowledge about current functionality it would be impossible to make inferences about the functionality of ancient brains  hominid paleoneurology refers specifically to the study of brain evolution by directly examining the fossil record of humans and their closest hominid relatives defined as species more closely related to humans than chimpanzees  paleoneurologists analyze endocasts that reproduce details of the external morphology of brains that have been imprinted on the internal surfaces of skulls    humans have had a long interest in the brain and its functions the first recorded study of the brain and its functions was from a papyrus text written by the ancient egyptians during the 17th century bce the document details 48 medical ailments and makes references to how to deal with head wounds much later in the 6th century bce the ancient greeks began to focus on studies of the brain and the relationship between the optic nerve and the brain studies of brain evolution however did not come about until much later in human history  comparative anatomy began its emergence in the latter part of the 19th century two main views of life sprung forth rationalism and transcendentalism these formed the basis for the thought of scientists in this period georges cuvier and étienne geoffroy st hilaire were leaders in the new field of comparative anatomy cuvier believed in the ability to create a functional morphology based simply on empirical evidence he stressed function of the organ must coincide with its form geoffroy in contrast put a heavy emphasis on intuition as a method of understanding his thought was based on two principles the principle of connections and the principle of unity of plan geoffroy was one of the first to look for homologies in organs across species though he believed that this was evidence of a universal plan rather than descent with modification  the late part of the 19th century in comparative anatomy was heavily influenced by the work of charles darwin in the on the origin of species in 1859 this work completely changed the views of comparative anatomists within 8 years of darwins release of the origin of species his views on descent from a common ancestor were widely accepted this led to a shift in trying to understand how different parts of the brain evolved  the next major innovation that helped to bring about paleoneurology was the microscope although the microscope was invented in the 17th century it was only used in biology in the beginning in the late 19th century the techniques of observing brain cells under a microscope took a long time to refine in 1873 with this tool in hand camillo golgi began to cellularly detail the brain and employ techniques to perfect axonal microscoping ludwig edinger took advantage of this and came up with a new branch of anatomy called comparative neuroanatomy edinger held that vertebrates evolved in a linear progressive series he also thought that changes in the brain were based on a series of additions and differentiations and that the most highly complex brains were those that were the most encephalized  the period of 18851935 was an explosion of ideas in comparative neuroanatomy this era culminated in the publication of the comparative anatomy of the nervous system by arienns kappers huber and cosby this paper influenced tilly edinger and she later became to founder of paleoneurology  ottilie tilly edinger was born in frankfurt germany in 1897 her father ludwig edinger himself a pioneer in comparative neurology provided tilly with invaluable exposure to his field and the scientific community at large tilly had many private tutors before attending schillerschule the only secondary school for girls in frankfurt at that time tilly edinger continued her schooling with university studies in zoology geology and paleontology while preparing her doctoral dissertation edinger encountered a natural brain endocast of nothosaurus a marine reptile from the mesozoic era edingers first paper published in 1921 centered on the characteristics of the nothosaurus specimen prior to the publication of her work inferences about the evolution of the vertebrate brain were made exclusively through comparative anatomy of extant fish amphibian reptile bird and mammal brains tilly edingers background in neurology and paleontology paved the way for her to integrate comparative anatomy and stratigraphic sequence thus introducing the concept of time to neurology and creating the field of paleoneurology the field was formally defined with the publication of die fossilen gehirne fossil brains in 1929 which compiled knowledge on the subject that had previously been scattered in a wide variety of journals and treated as isolated events  while still in germany edinger began studying extant species from a paleoneurological perspective by making inferences about evolutionary brain development in seacows using stratigraphic and comparative anatomical evidence edinger continued her research in nazi germany until the night of november 9 1938 when thousands of jews were killed or imprisoned in what became known as kristallnacht although a visa was not immediately available for immigration to the united states with the help of friends and colleagues who valued her work edinger was able to immigrate to london where she translated german medical texts into english eventually her visa quota number was called and she was able to immigrate to the united states where she took on a position as a research fellow at harvards museum of comparative zoology  her contributions to the field of paleoneurology include determining the extent to which endocasts reflect the anatomy of ancient brains the adequacy of comparative anatomy to interpret brain evolution the ability of brain endocasts to predict the lifestyles of extinct organisms and if brain size has increased over geological time topics which are still being explored today in her later years edinger corresponded with the next generation of paleoneurologists which insured that the work from her 50 year career continued into the future the pinnacle accomplishment of her career was the compilation of an annotated bibliography of paleoneurological papers published between 1804 and 1966 the bibliography paleoneurology 18041966 was completed and published by colleagues posthumously in 1975 due to the untimely death of edinger from injuries sustained during a traffic accident in 1967  paleoneurologists ralph l holloway and dean falk disagree about the interpretation of a depression on the australopithecus afarensis al 16228 endocast holloway argues that the depression is a result of lipping at the lambdoid suture and that the sulcal patterns indicate cerebral organization moving toward a more human pattern while falk insists that the depression is the lunate sulcus in a position that is indicative of an apelike sulcal pattern the debate between these two scientists is not hinged solely on the al 16228 endocast but rather extends to all australopithecine fossils with holloway insisting on the presence of hominid sulcal features and falk maintaining that the features are pongid in nature the debate between holloway and falk is so intense that between 1983 and 1985 they published four papers on the identification of the medial end of the lunate sulcus of the taung endocast australopithecus africanus which only further strengthened the division between each scientists respective opinion although there have been no definitive conclusions about the fossils in question many techniques were created or critically analyzed and refined as a result of the conflict these new techniques in endocast analysis included the use of stereoplotting to transfer sulci between differently shaped endocasts measurement of indexes from photographs rather than directly from specimens and confounding of measurements taken directly from specimens and those taken from photographs  a brain endocast is the imprintation of the inner features of a cranium that captures the details created from pressure exerted on the skull by the brain itself endocasts can be formed naturally by sedimentation through the cranial foramina which becomes rockhard due to calcium deposition over time or artificially by creating a mold from silicon or latex that is then filled with plasterofparis while sitting in a water bath to equalize forces and retain the original shape natural endocasts are very rare most of those that are studied are the result of artificial methods although the name implies that it is a copy of the once living brain endocasts rarely exhibit convolutions due to buffering by the pia mater arachnoid mater and dura mater that once surrounded and protected the brain tissue furthermore not all endocasts are created from a complete cranial fossil and subsequently the missing parts are approximated based on similar fossils in some cases fragments from several fossils of the same species are used to construct a single endocast  more recently computed tomography has played a large role in reconstructing endocasts the procedure is noninvasive and has the advantage of being able to analyze a fossil in record time with little risk of damaging the fossil under review ct imaging is achieved through the application of xrays to produce tomographs or sectional density images which are similar to the images produced during mri scans  ct scans use slices approximately 1mm thick to reconstruct a virtual model of the specimen  this method is especially useful when a fossil cranium is occupied by a natural endocast that cannot be removed without destroying the skeletal portions of the fossil because the cranium and its contents are of different densities the endocranial cavity and its unique traits can be reconstructed virtually  radiographic technique such as computed tomographic imaging or ct scans coupled with computer programing have been used to analyze brain endocasts from as early as 1906  recent development of advanced computer graphics technology have allowed scientists to more accurately analyze of brain endocasts m vannier and g conroy of washington university school of medicine have developed a system that images and analyzes surface morphologies in 3d scientists are able to encode surface landmarks that allows them to analyze sulcal length cortical asymmetries and volume  radiologist paleoanthropologists computer scientists in both the united states and europe have collaborated to study such fossils using virtual techniques  paleoneurology revolves around the analysis of endocasts much of this analysis is focused on interpreting sulcal patterns which is difficult because traces are often hardly recognizable and there are no clear landmarks to use as reference points furthermore the only clear reference plane is the sagittal plane one which is marked by distinct cerebral asymmetries since the obtaining of clear data from fossil details is usually very difficult much debate arises over interpretations experience is often an important factor in endocast analysis  therefore a large portion of the field of paleoneurology arises out of developing more detailed procedures that increase the resolution and the reliability of interpretations statistical analysis of brain endocasts gives information on the increases in overall brain volume endocranial volume because endocasts are not exact replicas or exact casts of a onceliving brain computer algorithms and ct scans are needed to calculate endocranial volume the calculated endocranial volume includes the meninges cerebrospinal fluid and cranial nerves therefore these volumes end up larger than the onceliving brain  this information is useful for calculating relative brain size rbs and encephalization quotient eq the corresponding body weight of the subject must also be known to calculated rbs rbs is calculated by dividing the weight of the brain by body weight eq can be determined several different ways depending on the data set used for example holloway and post calculate eq by the following equation brain volume is prominent in the scientific literature for discussing taxonomic identification behavioral complexity intelligence and dissimilar rates of evolution in modern humans cranial capacity can vary by as much as 1000 cc without any correlation to behavior this degree of variation is almost equivalent to the total increase in volume from australopithecine fossils to modern humans and brings into question the validity of relying on cranial capacity as a measurement of sophistication  many paleoneurologists measure cranial capacity via the submersion method in which displacement of water in a beaker is taken as the volume of the endocast scientists who believe that this method is not accurate enough will use a similar procedure in which a beaker with a spout is filled until it is full the water displaced by the endocast is then weighed to determine the endocast volume although both of these techniques are significantly more precise than previous methods scientists are optimistic that more advanced techniques such as computed tomography will provide greater accuracy of volume measurements  morphometric analysis relies on chord and arc measurements of the endocast surface length width bregmabasion and height meausrements of an endocast are taken with spreading calipers  frontal lobe parietal lobe and occipital lobe chord length the length of the lobe at its widest point along the midsagittal plane are measured using a dioptograph in which landmarks are projected onto a twodimensional surface measurements may be skewed if the orientation of the endocast has not been properly determined before the dioptograph is made geometric morphometrics systems of coordinates superimposed over the measurements of the endocast are often applied to allow comparison between specimens of varying size measurements may also be taken in reference to brocas area height of the endocast at 25 intervals of the maximum length and the vault module mean of maximum length width and middle height  although other measurements may be taken the choice of landmarks are not always consistent between studies   convolutions the individual gyri and sulci that compose the folds of the brain are the most difficult aspect of an endocast to accurately assess the surface of the brain is often referred to as smooth and fuzzy due to the meninges and vasculature that cover the brains surface it is possible to observe underlying gyri and sulci patterns if an endocast is accuratly or preserved but the uncertainty associated with these patterns often leads to controversy  because the robust australopithecine fossils show these details convolutions are included in the study of endocasts whenever appropriate  the degree of asymmetry between right and left hemispheres is a point of interest to most paleoneurologists because it could be linked to handedness or language development of the specimen asymmetries occur due to hemispherical specialization and are observed in both a qualitative and quantitative manner the unevenness of the hemispheres known as a petalia is characterized by a lobe that is wider andor protruding beyond the contralateral lobe for example a righthanded person typically has larger left occipital lobe and right frontal lobes than the contralateral lobes petalias also occur due to specialization in the communication centers of the frontal cortex of the brain in modern humans petalias in the occipital lobe are easier to detect than those in the frontal lobe  certain asymmetries have been documented on homo erectus specimens such as the homo redolfensis specimen from 18 million years ago that resemble the same asymmetries from modern humans  some gorillas have shown strong petalias but they are not found in combination with other petalias as is almost always the case in humans scientists use the presence of petalias to show sophistication but they are not a definitive indicator of evolution toward a more human brain  although the meninges have no link to behavior they are still studied within the realm of paleoneurology due to the high degree of conservation of meningeal patterns within a species which may serve as a way to determine taxonomy and phylogeny  because meningeal blood vessels comprise part of the outermost layer of the brain they often leave vascular grooves in the cranial cavity that are captured in endocasts endocranial vasculature originates around the foramina in the skull and in a living body would supply blood to the calvaria and dura mater the vasculature is so well preserved in some fossils that terminal branches of the circulatory system can be observed analysis of cranial vasculature concentrates on the anterior meningeal system of the frontal region the middle meningeal system of the parietotemporal and part of the anterior occipital region and the cerebellar fossa system of the cerebellar region in the course of hominid evolution the middle meningeal system has undergone the most change although cranial vasculature has been exhaustively studied in the last century there has been no consensus on an identification scheme for the branches and patterns of the vascular system resulting from little overlap of results between studies as such endocranial vasculature is better suited for inferring the amount of blood delivered to different parts of the brain  it is impossible to determine accurate location of the central or precentral sulci from an endocast still it can provide a rough idea of lobe sizes  the study of paleoneurology allows researchers to examine the evolutionary nature of human encephalization traditionally paleoneurologists have focused on determining the volume of the ancient brain and the patterns that emerged among related species by finding these measurements researchers have been able to predict the average body weight of species endocasts also reveal traits of the ancient brain including relative lobe size blood supply and other general insight into the anatomy of evolving species  while paleoneurology is useful in the study of brain evolution certain limitations to the information this study provides do exist the limited scale and completeness of the fossil record inhibits the ability of paleoneurology to accurately document the course of brain evolution  further fossil preservation is necessary to ensure accuracy of the endocasts studied weathering erosion and overall gradual disfiguration may alter the naturally recovered endocasts or endocasts created from existing fossils  the morphology of the brain can also be difficult to both quanitfy and describe further complicating the observations made from the study of endocasts  additionally paleoneurology provides very little insight into the actual anatomy within the brains of species studied the study of endocasts is limited to the external anatomy only the relationship among endocranial traits remains elusive comparative paleoeneurology reveals mostly only differences in endocranial size among related species such as gorilla gorilla since there is no proven direct relationship between brain size and intelligence only inferences can be made regarding the developing behavior of ancient relatives of the homo genus these limitations of paleoneurology are currently being dealt with by the development of more advanced tools to refine the study of endocasts recent studies by emiliano bruner manuel martinloechesb miguel burgaletac and roberto colomc have investigated the connection between midsagittal brain shape and mental speed this study incorporated human subjects cognitive testing in relationship to extinct humans they used 2d from 102 mriscanned young adult human for comparison such correlations are small suggesting that the influence of midsagittal brain geometry on individual cognitive performance is negligible but still provides useful information of evolutionary traits of the brain areas associated with the parietal cortex appear to be involved in relationships between brain geometry and mental speed  scientist j ghika believes use of paleoneurology is the best way to analyze several neurodegeneration leading to diseases such as parkinsons disease dyskinesias gait disorders pagets disease of bone dysautonomia and so on a past study by si rapoport on alzheimers disease in homo sapiens has shown the importance in using a darwinian perspective to better understand this disease itself and its symptoms  the aim is to determine the genetic mechanisms that lead to focal or asymmetrical brain atrophy resulting in syndromic presentations that affect gait hand movements any sort of locomotion language cognition mood and behavior disorders most riskfactors for neurodegenerative disease places highest priority on aging as causation scientists and physicians together can use clinical signs and symptoms to classify different diseases according to the changes taking place in specific brain areas in homo sapiens leading to physical disease

V the framingham risk score is a genderspecific algorithm used to estimate the 10year cardiovascular risk of an individual the framingham risk score was first developed based on data obtained from the framingham heart study to estimate the 10year risk of developing coronary heart disease  in order to assess the 10year cardiovascular disease risk cerebrovascular events peripheral artery disease and heart failure were subsequently added as disease outcomes for the 2008 framingham risk score on top of coronary heart disease    the framingham risk score is one of a number of scoring systems used to determine an individuals chances of developing cardiovascular disease a number of these scoring systems are available online  cardiovascular risk scoring systems give an estimate of the probability that a person will develop cardiovascular disease within a specified amount of time usually 10 to 30 years  because they give an indication of the risk of developing cardiovascular disease they also indicate who is most likely to benefit from prevention for this reason cardiovascular risk scores are used to determine who should be offered preventive drugs such as drugs to lower blood pressure and drugs to lower cholesterol levels for example nearly 30 of coronary heart disease chd events in both men and women were singularly attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal 13085 showing that blood pressure management and monitoring is paramount both to cardiovascular health and prediction of outcomes  because risk scores such as the framingham risk score give an indication of the likely benefits of prevention they are useful for both the individual patient and for the clinician in helping decide whether lifestyle modification and preventive medical treatment and for patient education by identifying men and women at increased risk for future cardiovascular events  coronary heart disease chd risk at 10 years in percent can be calculated with the help of the framingham risk score individuals with low risk have 10 or less chd risk at 10 years with intermediate risk 1020 and with high risk 20 or more however it should be remembered that these categorisations are arbitrary a more useful metric is to consider the effects of treatment if a group of 100 persons all have a 20 tenyear risk of cardiovascular disease it means that we should expect that 20 of these 100 individuals will develop cardiovascular disease coronary heart disease or stroke in the next 10 years and eighty of them will not develop cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years if they were to take a combination of treatments for example drugs to lower cholesterol levels plus drugs to lower blood pressure that reduced their risk of cardiovascular disease by half it means that 10 of these 100 individuals should be expected to develop cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years and 90 of them should not be expected to develop cardiovascular disease if that was the case then 10 of these individuals would have avoided cardiovascular disease by taking treatment for 10 years 10 would get cardiovascular disease whether or not they took treatment and 80 would not have got cardiovascular disease whether or not they took treatment it is important to recognize that the strongest predictor of cardiovascular risk in any risk equation is age almost all persons aged 70 and over are at 20 ten year cardiovascular risk and almost nobody aged under 40 is at 20 ten year cardiovascular risk since those who benefit most from treatment are those at highest risk this means that treatment of patients with raised blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels in their thirties benefits very few whereas treatment of patients with normal blood pressure and normal cholesterol levels in their seventies benefits many this casts doubt on the wisdom of categorizing individuals as having high blood pressure or raised cholesterol and treating these individual risk factors without a consideration of both their overall risk of cardiovascular disease and of the probability that they will benefit cardiovascular disease is common in the general population affecting the majority of adults it includes 1 coronary heart disease chd myocardial infarction mi angina pectoris heart failure hf and coronary death 2 cerebrovascular disease stroke and transient ischemic attack tia 3 peripheral arterial disease intermittent claudication and significant limb ischemia 4 aortic disease aortic atherosclerosis thoracic aortic aneurysm and abdominal aortic aneurysm an individuals risk for future cardiovascular events is modifiable by lifestyle changes and preventive medical treatment lifestyle changes can include stopping smoking healthy diet regular exercise etc preventive medical treatment can include a statin mini dose aspirin treatment for hypertension etc it is important to be able to predict the risk of an individual patient in order to decide when to initiate lifestyle modification and preventive medical treatment multiple risk models for the prediction of cardiovascular risk of individual patients have been developed one such key risk model is the framingham risk score the framingham risk score is based on findings from the framingham heart study the framingham risk score has been validated in the usa both in men and women both in european americans and african americans  while several studies have claimed to improve on the frs there is little evidence for any improved prediction beyond the framingham risk score   there are two limitations the framingham risk score predicts only future coronary heart disease chd events however it does not predict future total cardiovascular events meaning that it does not predict risk for stroke transient ischemic attack tia and heart failure these also important patient outcomes were included in the 2008 framingham general cardiovascular risk score  the predicted risk for an individual usually is higher with the 2008 framingham general cardiovascular risk score than with the 2002 framingham risk score the framingham risk score could overestimate or underestimate risk in populations other than the us population   and within the usa in populations other than european americans and african americans eg hispanic americans and native americans  it is not yet clear if this limitation is real or appears to be real because of differences in methodology etc as a result other countries may prefer to use another risk score eg score heartscore is the interactive version of score  systematic coronary risk evaluation  which has been recommended by the european society of cardiology in 2007  if possible a cardiology professional should select the risk prediction model which is most appropriate for an individual patient and should remember that this is only an estimate current version of the framingham risk score was published in 2008 the publishing body is the atp iii ie the adult treatment panel iii an expert panel of the national heart lung and blood institute which is part of the national institutes of health nih usa ther prior version was published in 2002   the original framingham risk score had been published in 1998  the first framingham risk score included age sex ldl cholesterol hdl cholesterol blood pressure and also whether the patient is treated or not for hisher hypertension diabetes and smoking it estimated the 10year risk for coronary heart disease chd it performed well and correctly predicted 10year risk for chd in american men and women of european and african descent the updated version was modified to include dyslipidemia age range hypertension treatment smoking and total cholesterol and it excluded diabetes because type 2 diabetes meanwhile was considered to be a chd risk equivalent having the same 10year risk as individuals with prior chd patients with type 1 diabetes were considered separately with slightly less aggressive goals while at increased risk no study had shown them to be at equivalent risk for chd as those with previously diagnosed coronary disease or type 2 diabetes  some patients without known chd have risk of cardiovascular events that is comparable to that of patients with established chd cardiology professionals refer to such patients as having a chd risk equivalent these patients should be managed as patients with known chd chd risk equivalents are patients with a 10year risk for mi or coronary death 20 chd risk equivalents are primarily other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease the national cholesterol education program nceps atp iii guidelines also list diabetes as a chd risk equivalent since it also has a 10year risk for chd around 20 ncep atp iii chd risk equivalents are the framinghamatp iii criteria were used to estimate chd risk in the usa data from 11611 patients from a very large study the nhanes iii were used the patients were 20 to 79 years of age and had no self reported chd stroke peripheral arterial disease or diabetes the results 82 of patients had low risk 10 or less chd risk at 10 years 16 had intermediate risk 1020 3 had high risk 20 or more  high risk was most commonly found in patients with advanced age and was more common in men than women framingham risk score the first part of this name ie framingham may be called either framingham or framinghamatp iii by cardiology professionals and the second part may be called score risk score or cardiac risk score all possible combinations have been used however framingham risk score is more common than the other variants below are the points of the framingham risk score in detail however it is much easier to use the calculator on the internet age 2034 years minus 7 points 3539 years

V the uterus from latin uterus plural uteri or womb is a major female hormoneresponsive reproductive sex organ of most mammals including humans one end the cervix opens into the vagina while the other is connected to one or both fallopian tubes uterine tubes depending on the species it is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation usually developing completely in placental mammals such as humans and partially in marsupials such as kangaroos and opossums two uteri usually form initially in a female and usually male fetus and in placental mammals they may partially or completely fuse into a single uterus depending on the species in many species with two uteri only one is functional humans and other higher primates such as chimpanzees usually have a single completely fused uterus although in some individuals the uteri may not have completely fused horses on the other hand have bipartite uteri in english the term uterus is used consistently within the medical and related professions while the germanicderived term womb is more common in everyday usage  most animals that lay eggs such as birds and reptiles including most ovoviviparous species have an oviduct instead of a uterus note however that recent research into the biology of the viviparous not merely ovoviviparous skink trachylepis ivensi has revealed development of a very close analogue to eutherian mammalian placental development  in monotremes mammals which lay eggs namely the platypus and the echidnas either the term uterus or oviduct is used to describe the same organ but the egg does not develop a placenta within the mother and thus does not receive further nourishment after formation and fertilization marsupials have two uteri each of which connect to a lateral vagina and which both use a third middle vagina which functions as the birth canal marsupial embryos form a choriovitelline placenta which can be thought of as something between a monotreme egg and a true placenta in which the eggs yolk sac supplies a large part of the embryos nutrition but also attaches to the uterine wall and takes nutrients from the mothers bloodstream   the uterus is located inside the pelvis immediately dorsal and usually somewhat rostral to the urinary bladder and ventral to the rectum the human uterus is pearshaped and about 3 in 76cm long 45cm broad side to side and 30cm thick anteroposterior  a nonpregnant adult uterus weighs about 60 grams the uterus can be divided anatomically into four segments the fundus corpus cervix and the internal os from outside to inside the path to the uterus is as follows the three layers from innermost to outermost are as follows the uterus is primarily supported by the pelvic diaphragm perineal body and the urogenital diaphragm secondarily it is supported by ligaments and the peritoneum broad ligament of uterus  normally the uterus lies in anteversion  anteflexion in most women the long axis of the uterus is bent forward on the long axis of the vagina this position is referred to as anteversion of the uterus furthermore the long axis of the body of the uterus is bent forward at the level of the internal os with the long axis of the cervix this position is termed anteflexion of the uterus  uterus assumes anteverted position in 50 women retroverted position in 25 women and rest have midposed uterus  it is held in place by several peritoneal ligaments of which the following are the most important there are two of each the uterus is in the middle of the pelvic cavity in frontal plane due to ligamentum latum uteri the fundus does not surpass the linea terminalis while the vaginal part of the cervix does not extend below interspinal line the uterus is mobile and moves posteriorly under the pressure of a full bladder or anteriorly under the pressure of a full rectum if both are full it moves upwards increased intraabdominal pressure pushes it downwards the mobility is conferred to it by musculofibrous apparatus that consists of suspensory and sustentacular part under normal circumstances the suspensory part keeps the uterus in anteflexion and anteversion in 90 of women and keeps it floating in the pelvis the meaning of these terms are described below sustentacular part supports the pelvic organs and comprises the larger pelvic diaphragm in the back and the smaller urogenital diaphragm in the front the pathological changes of the position of the uterus are in cases where the uterus is tipped also known as retroverted uterus women may have symptoms of pain during sexual intercourse pelvic pain during menstruation minor incontinence urinary tract infections fertility difficulties  and difficulty using tampons a pelvic examination by a doctor can determine if a uterus is tipped   in mammals the four main forms in which it is found are in monotremes such as the platypus the uterus is duplex and rather than nurturing the embryo secretes the shell around the egg it is essentially identical with the shell gland of birds and reptiles with which the uterus is homologous  the uterus is supplied by arterial blood both from the uterine artery and the ovarian artery another anastomotic branch may also supply the uterus from anastomosis of these two arteries afferent nerves supplying uterus are t11 and t12 sympathetic supply is from hypogastric plexus  and ovarian plexus parasympathetic supply is from second third and fourth sacral nerves vertical section of mucous membrane of human uterus bilateral müllerian ducts form during early fetal life in males mif secreted from the testes leads to their regression in females these ducts give rise to the fallopian tubes and the uterus in humans the lower segments of the two ducts fuse to form a single uterus however in cases of uterine malformations this development may be disturbed the different uterine forms in various mammals are due to various degrees of fusion of the two müllerian ducts the uterus consists of a body and a cervix the cervix protrudes into the vagina the uterus is held in position within the pelvis by condensations of endopelvic fascia which are called ligaments these ligaments include the pubocervical transverse cervical ligaments or mackenrodts ligaments or cardinal ligaments and the uterosacral ligaments it is covered by a sheetlike fold of peritoneum the broad ligament  the uterus is essential in sexual response by directing blood flow to the pelvis and to the external genitalia including the ovaries vagina labia and clitoris the reproductive function of the uterus is to accept a fertilized ovum which passes through the uterotubal junction from the fallopian tube uterine tube it implants into the endometrium and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose the fertilized ovum becomes an embryo attaches to a wall of the uterus creates a placenta and develops into a fetus gestates until childbirth due to anatomical barriers such as the pelvis the uterus is pushed partially into the abdomen due to its expansion during pregnancy even during pregnancy the mass of a human uterus amounts to only about a kilogram 22 pounds some pathological states include in 2012 the worlds first womb transplant from a dead donor was performed on a turkish woman who was born without a womb but has her own ovaries she is in good condition and the womb is functional in the year 2000 in saudi arabia a similar transplant was performed but from a live donor although womb transplants have been successful in animals such as mice rats and sheep the prevailing opinion in the field is that the risks are too great apart from risks of rejection of the new womb there is concern that the drugs necessary for prevention of rejection of the donated womb might harm the fetus  schematic frontal view of female and male anatomy uterus and uterine tubes sectional plan of the gravid uterus in the third and fourth month fetus in utero between fifth and

V most fish exchange gases using gills on either side of the pharynx throat gills are tissues which consist of cloth and fabric structures called filaments these filaments have many functions including the transfer of ions and water as well as the exchange of oxygen carbon dioxide acids and ammonia   each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide fish exchange gases by pulling oxygenrich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills in some fish capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water causing countercurrent exchange the gills push the oxygenpoor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx some fish like sharks and lampreys possess multiple gill openings however bony fish have a single gill opening on each side this opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum juvenile bichirs have external gills a very primitive feature that they share with larval amphibians   air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers obligate air breathers such as the african lungfish are obligated to breathe air periodically or they suffocate facultative air breathers such as the catfish hypostomus plecostomus only breathe air if they need to and can otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators  all basal vertebrates breathe with gills the gills are carried right behind the head bordering the posterior margins of a series of openings from the esophagus to the exterior each gill is supported by a cartilagenous or bony gill arch  the gills of vertebrates typically develop in the walls of the pharynx along a series of gill slits opening to the exterior most species employ a countercurrent exchange system to enhance the diffusion of substances in and out of the gill with blood and water flowing in opposite directions to each other the gills are composed of comblike filaments the gill lamellae which help increase their surface area for oxygen exchange  when a fish breathes it draws in a mouthful of water at regular intervals then it draws the sides of its throat together forcing the water through the gill openings so that it passes over the gills to the outside the bony fish have three pairs of arches cartilaginous fish have five to seven pairs while the primitive jawless fish have seven the vertebrate ancestor no doubt had more arches as some of their chordate relatives have more than 50 pairs of gills  gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue branches or slender tufted processes that have a highly folded surface to increase surface area the high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only a small fraction of the dissolved oxygen that air does a cubic meter of air contains about 250 grams of oxygen at stp the concentration of oxygen in water is lower than air and it diffuses more slowly in a litre of freshwater the oxygen content is 8cm  per litre compared to 210 in the same volume of air  water is 777 times more dense than air and is 100 times more viscous  oxygen has a diffusion rate in air 10000 times greater than in water  the use of saclike lungs to remove oxygen from water would not be efficient enough to sustain life  rather than using lungs gaseous exchange takes place across the surface of highly vascularised gills over which a oneway current of water is kept flowing by a specialised pumping mechanism the density of the water prevents the gills from collapsing and lying on top of each other which is what happens when a fish is taken out of water  higher vertebrates do not develop gills the gill arches form during fetal development and lay the basis of essential structures such as jaws the thyroid gland the larynx the columella corresponding to the stapes in mammals and in mammals the malleus and incus  fish gill slits may be the evolutionary ancestors of the tonsils thymus gland and eustachian tubes as well as many other structures derived from the embryonic branchial pouches  in bony fish the gills lie in a branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum branchia is an ancient greek word for gills the great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills although a few have lost some over the course of evolution the operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills so that bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation and hence near constant motion to breathe valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping  the gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum so that the gills alone project from the arch supported by individual gill rays some species retain gill rakers though all but the most primitive bony fish lack a spiracle the pseudobranch associated with it often remains being located at the base of the operculum this is however often greatly reduced consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gilllike structure  marine teleosts also use gills to excrete electrolytes the gills large surface area tends to create a problem for fish that seek to regulate the osmolarity of their internal fluids saltwater is less dilute than these internal fluids so saltwater fish lose large quantities of water osmotically through their gills to regain the water they drink large amounts of seawater and excrete the salt freshwater is more dilute than the internal fluids of fish however so freshwater fish gain water osmotically through their gills  in some primitive bony fishes and amphibians the larvae bear external gills branching off from the gill arches  these are reduced in adulthood their function taken over by the gills proper in fishes and by lungs in most amphibians some amphibians retain the external larval gills in adulthood the complex internal gill system as seen in fish apparently being irrevocably lost very early in the evolution of tetrapods  sharks and rays typically have five pairs of gill slits that open directly to the outside of the body though some more primitive sharks have six or seven pairs adjacent slits are separated by a cartilaginous gill arch from which projects a long sheetlike septum partly supported by a further piece of cartilage called the gill ray the individual lamellae of the gills lie on either side of the septum the base of the arch may also support gill rakers small projecting elements that help to filter food from the water  a smaller opening the spiracle lies in the back of the first gill slit this bears a small pseudobranch that resembles a gill in structure but only receives blood already oxygenated by the true gills  the spiracle is thought to be homologous to the ear opening in higher vertebrates  most sharks rely on ram ventilation forcing water into the mouth and over the gills by rapidly swimming forward in slowmoving or bottom dwelling species especially among skates and rays the spiracle may be enlarged and the fish breathes by sucking water through this opening instead of through the mouth  chimaeras differ from other cartilagenous fish having lost both the spiracle and the fifth gill slit the remaining slits are covered by an operculum developed from the septum of the gill arch in front of the first gill  the shared trait of breathing via gills in bony fish and cartilaginous fish is a famous example of symplesiomorphy bony fish are more closely related to terrestrial vertebrates which evolved out of a clade of bony fishes that breathe through their skin or lungs than they are to the sharks rays and the other cartilaginous fish their kind of gill respiration is shared by the fishes because it was present in their common ancestor and lost in the other living vertebrates but based on this shared trait we cannot infer that bony fish are more closely related to sharks and rays than they are to terrestrial vertebrates  lampreys and hagfish do not have gill slits as such instead the gills are contained in spherical pouches with a circular opening to the outside like the gill slits of higher fish each pouch contains two gills in some cases the openings may be fused together effectively forming an operculum lampreys have seven pairs of pouches while hagfishes may have six to fourteen depending on the species in the hagfish the pouches connect with the pharynx internally in adult lampreys a separate respiratory tube develops beneath the pharynx proper separating food and water from respiration by closing a valve at its anterior end  although most fish respire primarily using gills some fishes can at least partially respire using mechanisms that do not require gills in some species cutaneous respiration accounts for 5 to 40 percent of the total respiration depending on temperature cutaneous respiration is more important in species that breathe air such as mudskippers and reedfish and in such species can account for nearly half the total respiration  fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended time periods amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms the skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly the buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air catfish of the families loricariidae callichthyidae and scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts  lungfish with the exception of the australian lungfish and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way loaches trahiras and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin similar to frogs a number of fish have evolved socalled accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air labyrinth fish such as gouramis and bettas have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function a few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function most notably snakeheads pikeheads and the clariidae catfish family breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow seasonally variable waters where the waters oxygen concentration may seasonally decline fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen such as perch and cichlids quickly suffocate while airbreathers survive for much longer in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud at the most extreme some airbreathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water entering a state of aestivation summertime hibernation until water returns fish gills are the preferred habitat of many ectoparasites parasites attached to the gill but living out of it the most commons are monogeneans and certain groups of parasitic copepods which can be extremely numerous  other ectoparasites found on gills are leeches and in seawater larvae of gnathiid isopods  endoparasites parasites living inside the gills include encysted adult didymozoid trematodes  a few trichosomoidid nematodes of the genus huffmanela including huffmanela ossicola which lives within the gill bone  and the encysted parasitic turbellarian paravortex  various protists and myxosporea are also parasitic on gills where they form cysts

shoulder straps and was decorated with lace in the cleavage   from the 16th century the undergarments of wealthier women in the western world were dominated by the corset which pushed the breasts upwards in the later 19th century clothing designers began experimenting with alternatives splitting the corset into multiple parts a girdlelike restraining device for the lower torso and devices that suspended the breasts from the shoulder to the upper torso  women have played a large part in the design and manufacture of the bra accounting for half the patents filed  the german christine hardt patented the first modern brassiere in 1889  sigmund lindauer from stuttgartbad cannstatt germany developed a brassiere for mass production in 1912 and patented it in 1913 it was massproduced by mechanischen trikotweberei ludwig maier und cie in böblingen germany  in the united states mary phelps jacob received a patent in 1914 for the first brassiere design that is recognized as the basis for modern bras   mass production in the early20th century made the garment widely available to women in the united states england western europe and other countries influenced by western fashion  metal shortages in world war i encouraged the end of the corset brassieres were initially manufactured by small production companies and supplied to retailers the term cup was not used until 1916 and manufacturers relied on stretchable cups to accommodate different sized breasts   women with larger or pendulous breasts had the choice of longline bras builtup backs wedgeshaped inserts between the cups wider straps power lastex firm bands under the cup and light boning  in october 1932 the sh camp and company correlated the size and pendulousness of breasts to letters a through d  camps advertising featured letterlabeled profiles of breasts in the february 1933 issue of corset and underwear review in 1937 warner began to feature cup sizing in its products adjustable bands were introduced using multiple hook and eye closures in the 1930s   by the time world war ii ended most fashionconscious women in europe and north america were wearing brassieres and women in asia africa and latin america began to adopt it  an urban legend that the brassiere was invented by a man named otto titzling tit sling who lost a lawsuit with phillip de brassiere fill up the brassiere originated with the 1971 book bustup the uplifting tale of otto titzling and the development of the bra and was propagated in a comedic song from the movie beaches  massproduced bras are manufactured to fit a prototypical woman standing with both arms at her sides the design assumes that both breasts are equally sized and symmetrical  a bra is one of the most complicated garments to make a typical design has between 20 and 48 parts including the band hooks cups lining and straps bras are built on a square frame model lingerie designer chantal thomass said its a highly technical garment made of lots of tiny pieces of fabric with so many sizes to consider for the different cups etc its a garment you wash every day so the seams and structure need to be extremely robust its very different from a piece of clothing its in direct contact with the skin it needs to be super solid  the bras main components are a chest band that wraps around the torso two cups and shoulder straps the chest band is usually closed in the back by a hook and eye fastener but may be fastened at the front  sleep bras or athletic bras do not have fasteners and are pulled on over the head and breasts the section between the cups is called a gore the section under the armpit where the band joins the cups is called the back wing  bra components including the cup top and bottom if seamed the central side and back panels and straps are cut to manufacturers specifications many layers of fabric may be cut at the same time using computercontrolled lasers or bandsaw shearing devices the pieces are assembled by piece workers using industrial sewing machines or automated machines coated metal hooks and eyes are sewn in by machine and heat processed or ironed into the back ends of the band and a tag or label is attached or printed onto the bra itself  the completed bras are folded mechanically or manually and packaged for shipment  the chest band and cups not the shoulder straps are designed to support the weight of womens breasts strapless bras rely on an underwire and additional seaming and stiffening panels to support them the shoulder straps of some sports bras cross over at the back to take the pressure off the shoulders when arms are raised manufacturers continually experiment with proprietary frame designs for example the playtex 18hour bra model utilizes an mframe design  bras were originally made of linen cotton broadcloth and twill weaves and sewn using flatfelled or biastape seams they are now made of a variety of materials including tricot spandex spanette latex microfiber satin jacquard foam mesh and lace  which are blended to achieve specific purposes spandex a synthetic fiber with builtin stretch memory can be blended with cotton polyester or nylon mesh is a hightech synthetic composed of ultrafine filaments that are tightly knit for smoothness  sixty to seventy percent of bras sold in the uk and us have underwired cups the underwire is made of metal plastic or resin    underwire is built around the perimeter of the cup where it attaches to the band increasing its rigidity to improve support lift and separation  wirefree or softcup bras have additional seaming and internal reinforcement tshirt bras utilize molded cups that eliminate seams and hide nipples others use padding or shaping materials to enhance bust size or cleavage  in most countries bras come in a band and cup size such as 34c 34 is the band width which is the measurement directly underneath the breasts and c is the cup size which refers to the volume of the breasts most bras are offered in 36 sizes the triumph doreen comes in 67 sizes up to 46j  bra cup size is relative to the band size as the volume of a womans breast changes with the dimension of her chest a b cup on a 34 band is not the same size as a b cup on a 36 band  in countries that have adopted the european en 13402 dresssize standard the measurement is rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 centimetres 20in   a poorly fitted bra can cause back and neck pain  women with larger breasts tend to buy bras that are too small while smallerbreasted women do the opposite   because manufacturing standards vary widely finding a correctly fitting bra is difficult    women tend to find a bra that appears to fit and stay with that size even though they may lose and gain weight in a survey in the united kingdom 60 of over 2000 women between the ages of 16 to 75 said they had had a bra fitting and 99 said that fit was the least important factor when selecting a bra  increased publicity about the issue of poorly fitted bras has increased the number of women seeking a fitting the uk retailer marks  spencer stated that about 8000 women are fitted for bras in their stores weekly  despite this about 8085 of women still wear the wrong bra size   bra experts recommend professional bra fittings from the lingerie department of a clothing store or a specialty lingerie store especially for cup sizes d or larger and particularly if there has been significant weight gain or loss or if the wearer is continually adjusting her bra  women in the uk change their bra size on average six times over their lifetimes  symptoms of a loose bra band include the band riding up the back if the band causes flesh to spill over the edges it is too small  a woman can test whether a bra band is too tight or loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are in the back and then check for fit and comfort  experts suggest that women choose a band size that fits using the outermost set of hooks this allows the wearer to use the tighter hooks as the bra stretches during its lifetime   doreenby triumph international  bras can enhance or minimize the size of breasts create cleavage and in the case of

not anatomically required to support breasts but are worn in response to cultural influences  womens choices about what bra to wear are consciously and unconsciously affected by social perceptions of the ideal female body shape which changes over time  in the 1920s in the united states the fashion was to flatten the breasts as typified in the flapper era during the 1940s and 1950s the sweater girl became fashionable supported by a bullet bra known also as a torpedo or cone bra as worn by jane russell and patti page  in the early 1960s smaller breasts gained popularity and in the late 1990s larger breasts became more fashionable  iris young described preferences in the united states in 1990 round sitting high on the chest large but not bulbous with the look of firmness this is regarded as contradictory in several ways   during the 1960s designers and manufacturers introduced padded and underwire bras after the miss america protest in september 1968 manufacturers were concerned that women would stop wearing bras in response many altered their marketing and claimed that wearing their bra was like not wearing a bra  in the 1970s women sought more comfortable and naturallooking bras  victorias secret commissions a fantasy bra every fall in 2003 it hired the jeweller mouawad to design one containing more than 2500 carats of diamonds and sapphires valued at usd10 million it was the worlds most valuable bra at the time  it became fashionable from the early 1990s to wear clothing that showed bra straps  sports bras in particular are often worn as outerwear  versaces fall 2013

outerwear during her 1990 blond ambition world tour sold for usd52000 in 2012 at the christies pop culture auction in london  wearing clothes that reveal the bra or straps became so common that cosmopolitan created guidelines in 2012 on how to expose them advice included avoiding plain fleshtoned smoothcup bras so that the exposure does not appear accidental making sure the bra is in good condition and wearing a style that either matches the color of the outerwear or is dramatically different  bras are not worn around the world in developing countries the cost of one may equal 1030

including to fiji vanuatu tonga and cambodia  in 2009 somalias hardline islamic group alshabaab forced women to shake their breasts at gunpoint to see if they were wearing bras which they called unislamic   a resident of mogadishu whose daughters were whipped said the islamists say a womans chest should be firm naturally or flat  surveys have reported that 525 percent of western women do not wear a bra    a harris poll commissioned by playtex asked more than 1000 women what they like in a bra among the respondents 67 percent said they prefer wearing a bra to going braless while 85 percent wanted to wear a shapeenhancing bra that feels like nothing at all they were split as regards underwire bras 49 percent said they prefer underwire bras the same percentage as those who said they

 consumers spend around 16billion a year worldwide on bras  in the us during 2012 women owned an average of nine bras and wore six on a regular basis  that increased from 2006 when the average american woman owned six one of which was strapless and one in a color other than white  british women in a 2009 survey reported that they owned an average of 16 bras  the average bra size among north

sri lanka india and china while there has been some social pressure from the antisweatshop and antiglobalization movements on manufacturers to reduce use of sweatshop labor most major apparel manufacturers rely on them directly and indirectly prior to 2005 a trade agreement limited textile imports to the european union and the us china was exporting us339 billion in textiles and clothing each year to the eu and the us when those quotas expired on 1 january 2005 the socalled bra wars began within six months china shipped 30 million more bras to the two markets 33 more to the us and 63

paid 030 yuan for every 100 bra straps they helped assemble in one day they could earn 20 to 30 yuan  informal surveys have found that many women began wearing bras to be fashionable to conform to social or maternal pressure or for physical support women sometimes wear bras because they mistakenly believe they prevent sagging breasts  very few cited comfort as the reason while many western women recognize that they have been socialized to wear bras they may report feeling exposed or subject to violation without one or that wearing one improves their appearance     academic wendy burnsardolino wrote in 2007 that womens decision to wear bras is mediated by the male gaze   feminists began arguing in the 1960s and 1970s that the bra was an example of how womens clothing shaped and even deformed womens bodies to male expectations during a protest organized by new york radical women outside the miss america contest in atlantic city new jersey on 7 september 1968 hundreds of women symbolically threw feminine products including bras into a large trash can     professor lisa jardine listened to feminist germaine greer talk about bras during a formal college dinner in newnham college cambridge in 1964 at the graduates table germaine was explaining that there could be no liberation for women no matter how highly educated as long as we were required to cram our breasts into bras constructed like minivesuviuses two stitched white cantilevered cones which bore no resemblance to the female anatomy the willingly suffered discomfort of the sixties bra she opined vigorously was a hideous symbol of female oppression  greers book the female eunuch 1970 became associated with the bra burning movement because she pointed out how restrictive and uncomfortable a bra could be bras are a ludicrous invention she wrote but if you make bralessness a rule youre just subjecting yourself to yet another repression  while women did not literally burn their bras some stopped wearing them in protest   feminist author iris marion young wrote that the bra serves as a barrier to touch and that a braless woman is deobjectified eliminating the hard pointy look that phallic culture posits as the norm without a bra womens breasts are not consistently shaped objects but change as the woman moves reflecting the natural body  susan brownmiller in her book femininity 1984 took the position that women without bras shock and anger men because men implicitly think that they own breasts and that only they should remove bras  young wrote that in us culture breasts are subject to capitalist patriarchal american mediadominated culture that objectifies breasts before such a distancing glance that freezes and masters   other arguments include that training bras are used to indoctrinate girls into thinking about their breasts as sexual objects and to accentuate their sexuality  warren ellen 5 august 2010 playing peekaboo chicago tribune

V an apocrine sweat gland \u02c8æp\u0259kr\u0259n \u02c8æp\u0259\u02cckra\u026an or \u02c8æp\u0259\u02cckrin from greek apo away and krinein to separate   is a sweat gland composed of a coiled secretory portion located at the junction of the dermis and subcutaneous fat from which a straight portion inserts and secretes into the infundibular portion of the hair follicle  in humans apocrine sweat glands are found only in certain locations of the body the axillae armpits areola and nipples of the breast ear canal eyelids wings of the nostril perianal region and some parts of the external genitalia  modified apocrine glands include the ciliary glands in the eyelids the ceruminous glands which produce ear wax and the mammary glands which produce milk  the rest of the body is covered by eccrine sweat glands  most nonprimate mammals however have apocrine sweat glands over the greater part of their body  domestic animals such as dogs and cats have apocrine glands at each hair follicle but eccrine glands only in foot pads and snout their apocrine glands like those in humans produce an odorless oily opaque secretion  that gains its characteristic odor upon bacterial decomposition  eccrine glands on their paws increase friction and prevent them from slipping when fleeing from danger    the apocrine gland comprises a glomerulus of secretory tubules and an excretory duct that opens into hair follicle  on occasion an excretory duct opens to the skin surface next to the hair  the gland is large and spongy located in the subcutaneous fat deep in the dermis   and has a larger overall structure and lumen diameter than the eccrine sweat gland   the secretory tubules of apocrine glands are single layered but unlike the eccrine secretory tubules contain only a single type of ductal epithelial cell  and vary in diameter from place to place and sometimes branch off into multiple ducts the tubules are wrapped in myoepithelial cells which are more developed than in their eccrine gland counterparts   in hoofed animals and marsupials eccrine glands act as the main thermoregulator secreting watery sweat  for most mammals however apocrine sweat glands secrete an oily and eventually smelly compound that acts as a pheromone  territorial marker and warning signal    being sensitive to adrenaline apocrine sweat glands are involved in emotional sweating in humans induced by anxiety stress fear sexual stimulation and pain  in a fivemonthold human fetus apocrine glands are distributed all over the body after a few weeks they exist in only restricted areas  including the armpits and external genitalia  they are inactive until stimulated by hormonal changes in puberty  the apocrine gland secretes an oily fluid with proteins lipids and steroids that is odorless before microbial activity it appears on the skin surface mixed with sebum as sebaceous glands open into the same hair follicle  unlike eccrine sweat glands which secrete continuously the apocrine glands secrete in periodic spurts  apocrine sweat glands were originally thought to use only apocrine secretion vesicles pinch off the secretory cells then degrade in the secretory lumen releasing their product  more recent research has also shown that merocrine secretion takes place  myoepithelial cells form a smooth muscle lining around the secretory cells when the muscle contracts they squeeze the secretory ducts and push out the accumulated fluid into the hair follicle   sweat and sebum are mixed in the hair follicle and arrive mixed at the epidermal surface  the apocrine sweat is cloudy viscous initially odorless and at a ph of 675 it contains water protein carbohydrate waste material and nacl  the sweat only attains its characteristic odor upon being degraded by bacteria which releases volatile odor molecules  more bacteria especially corynebacteria leads to stronger odor the presence of axillary hair also makes the odor even more pungent as secretions debris keratin and bacteria accumulate on the hairs  nonprimate mammals usually have apocrine sweat glands over most of their bodies  horses use them as a thermoregulatory device as they are regulated by adrenaline and more widely distributed on equines than on other groups  skunks on the other hand use the glands to release a stench that acts as a defense mechanism  the axillary organs limited regions with equal numbers of apocrine and eccrine sweat glands only exist in humans gorillas and chimpanzees  in humans the apocrine glands in this region are the most developed with the most complex glomeruli  men have more apocrine sweat glands than women in all axillary regions   east asians who have nearly complete loss of typical body odor when compared to people of african descent have significantly less of the characteristic axillary odorants and variants in the abcc11 gene which is expressed and localized in apocrine sweat glands  individuals of subsaharan african ancestry have the largest and most active apocrine glands  racial differences also exist in the cerumen glands apocrine sweat glands which produce earwax  east asians have predominantly dry earwax as opposed to sticky the gene encoding for this is strongly linked to reduced body odor whereas those with wet sticky earwax africans are prone to more body odor

V in its most general form a nipple is a structure from which a fluid emanates more specifically it is the projection on the breasts or udder of a mammal by which in females breast milk is delivered to a mothers young in this sense it is often called a teat especially when referring to nonhumans and the medical term used to refer to it is papilla a breast or nipple is sometimes called a pap  the rubber mouthpiece of a baby bottle or pacifier may also be referred to as a nipple or a teat in humans nipples of both males and females are also one of the erogenous zones in many cultures human female nipples are sexualized  and it is considered a taboo   or a public indecency to uncover them in public   the word nipple most likely originates as a diminutive of neb an old english word meaning beak nose or face and which is of germanic origin  the words teat and tit share a germanic ancestor the second of the two tit was inherited directly from protogermanic while the first entered english via old french   in the anatomy of mammals a nipple mammary papilla or teat is a small projection of skin containing the outlets for 1520 lactiferous ducts arranged cylindrically around the tip the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli the dominant innervation to the nipple is derived from the lateral cutaneous branches of fourth intercostal nerve  the physiological purpose of nipples is to deliver milk to the infant produced in the female mammary glands during lactation marsupials and eutherian mammals typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally from as few as two to as many as 19  the average projection and size of human female nipples is slightly more than 38 of an inch 10mm  pregnancy and nursing tend to increase nipple size sometimes permanently pregnancy also deepens the pigmentation nipples of both males and females are one of the erogenous zones which are generally stimulated by hands or by mouth during foreplay which leads to sexual arousal  the male and female breast have a similar nerve supply but the nerves lie closer together in men whereas in a female breast they are spread out more widely  after puberty female breasts turn more sensitive likely due to hormonal influences  during arousal they generally become stiff erect and protrude nipple stimulation is sometimes intense enough to elicit an orgasm in some women research has suggested the sensations are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation and may also be directly linked to the genital area of the brain   in women one study indicated that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina clitoris and cervix nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain  from conception until sexual differentiation all mammalian fetuses within the same species look the same regardless of sex in humans this lasts for around 6 weeks after which geneticallymale fetuses begin producing male hormones such as testosterone  usually males nipples do not change much past this point however some males develop a condition known as gynecomastia in which the fatty tissue around and under the nipple develops into something similar to a female breast this may happen whenever the testosterone level drops gynecomastia although not as severe may occur in pubescent boys undergoing physical changes due to the rapid and uncontrolled release of hormones including estrogen the heightened levels of estrogen in pubescent male bodies leads to the swelling of the nipple and surrounding tissue  this can often look similar to a female human nipple  and may cause slight discomfort thus because the female template is the default for humans the question is not why evolution has not selected against male nipples but why it would be advantageous to select against male nipples to begin with the uncoupling of male and female traits occurs if there is selection for it if the trait is important to the reproductive success of both males and females but the best or optimal trait is different for a male and a female we would not expect such an uncoupling if the attribute is important in both sexes and the optimal value is similar in both sexes nor would we expect uncoupling to evolve if the attribute is important to one sex but unimportant in the other the latter is the case for nipples their advantage in females in terms of reproductive success is clear but because the genetic default is for males and females to share characters the presence of nipples in males is probably best explained as a genetic correlation that persists through lack of selection against them rather than selection for them interestingly though it could be argued that the occurrence of problems associated with the male nipple such as carcinoma constitutes contemporary selection against them in a nowfamous paper stephen jay gould and richard c lewontin emphasize that we should not immediately assume that every trait has an adaptive explanation just as the spandrels of st marks domed cathedral in venice are simply an architectural consequence of the meeting of a vaulted ceiling with its supporting pillars the presence of nipples in male mammals is a genetic architectural byproduct of nipples in females this idea implies men have nipples because females do

V talairach coordinates also known as talairach space is a 3dimensional coordinate system known as an atlas of the human brain which is used to map the location of brain structures independent from individual differences in the size and overall shape of the brain it is still common to use talairach coordinates in functional brain imaging studies and to target transcranial stimulation of brain regions  however alternative methods such as the mni coordinate system originated at the montreal neurological institute and hospital have largely replaced talairach for stereotaxy and other procedures    the coordinate system was first created by neurosurgeons jean talairach and gabor szikla in their work the talairach atlas in 1967 creating a standardized grid for neurosurgery  the grid was based on the idea that distances to lesions in the brain are proportional to overall brain size ie the distance between two structures is larger in a larger brain in 1988 a second edition of the talairach atlas came out that was coauthored by tournoux and it is sometimes known as the talairachtournoux system this atlas was based on single postmortem dissection of a human brain  the talairach atlas uses brodmann areas as the labels for brain regions  the talairach coordinate system is defined by making two anchors the anterior commissure and posterior commissure lie on a straight horizontal line  since these two points lie on the midsagittal plane the coordinate system is completely defined by requiring this plane to be vertical distances in talairach coordinates are measured from the anterior commissure as the origin as defined in the 1998 edition the yaxis points posterior and anterior to the commissures the left and right is the xaxis and the zaxis is in the ventraldorsal down and up directions  once the brain is reoriented to these axes the researchers must also outline the six cortical outlines of the brain anterior posterior left right inferior and superior  in the 1967 atlas the left is with positive coordinates while in the 1988 atlas the left has negative coordinates by defining standard anatomical landmarks that could be identified on different subjects the anterior and posterior commissures it became easier to spatially warp an individual brain image obtained through magnetic resonance imaging mri positron emission tomography pet and other imaging methods to this standard talairach space one can then make inferences about tissue identity at a specific location by referring to the atlas another common atlas for the human brain is the montreal neurological institute and hospital mni coordinate system which is the template used for spm and the international consortium for brain mapping most neuroimaging software packages are able to convert from talairach to mni coordinates

V the limbic lobe is an arcshaped region of cortex on the medial surface of each cerebral hemisphere of the mammalian brain consisting of parts of the frontal parietal and temporal lobes the term is ambiguous with some authors  including the paraterminal gyrus the subcallosal area the cingulate gyrus the parahippocampal gyrus the dentate gyrus the hippocampus and the subiculum  while the terminologia anatomica includes the cingulate sulcus the cingulate gyrus the isthmus of cingulate gyrus the fasciolar gyrus the parahippocampal gyrus the parahippocampal sulcus the dentate gyrus the fimbrodentate sulcus the fimbria of hippocampus the collateral sulcus and the rhinal sulcus and omits the hippocampus   broca named the limbic lobe in 1878 identifying it with the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri and associating it with the sense of smell  treviranus having earlier noted that between species the size of the parahippocampal gyrus varies with the size of the olfactory nerve  in 1937 papez theorized that a circuit including the hippocampal formation and the cingulate gyrus constitutes the neural substrate of emotional behavior  and klüver and bucy reported that in monkeys resection involving the hippocampal formation and the amygdaloid complex has a profound effect on emotional responses   as a consequence of these publications the idea that the entire limbic lobe is dedicated to olfaction receded and a direct connection between emotion and the limbic lobe was established  limbic lobe shown in red of left cerebral hemisphere limbic lobe shown in orange of left cerebral hemisphere limbic lobe shown in purple of right cerebral hemisphere limbic lobe shown in purple of right cerebral hemisphere

V ceruminous glands are specialized sudoriferous glands sweat glands located subcutaneously in the external auditory canal ceruminous glands are simple coiled tubular glands made up of an inner secretory layer of cells and an outer myoepithelial layer of cells  they are classed as apocrine glands the glands drain into larger ducts which then drain into the guard hairs that reside in the external auditory canal  here they produce cerumen or earwax by mixing their secretion with sebum and dead epidermal cells cerumen keeps the eardrum pliable lubricates and cleans the external auditory canal waterproofs the canal kills bacteria and serves as a barrier to trap foreign particles dust fungal spores etc by coating the guard hairs of the ear making them sticky  these glands are capable of developing both benign and malignant tumors the benign tumors include ceruminous adenoma ceruminous pleomorphic adenoma and ceruminous syringocystadenoma papilliferum the malignant tumors include ceruminous adenocarcinoma adenoid cystic carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma

V cleavage enhancement encompasses a range of techniques used temporarily to improve the appearance of a persons breast cleavage or to create the illusion of breast cleavage on a person who has no such cleavage this ranges from brassieres bras that lightly push the breasts together without any padding through a range of increasingly padded bras to techniques where chest skin is pulled towards the centre to generate cleavage and completely artificial breasts such as breast prostheses are added to cover the materials used to pull the skin cleavage enhancement may also include the use of makeup to deepen the appearance of the cleavage and make the breasts either side of the cleavage appear more prominent   women often want to enhance their cleavage for special occasions or to suit the style of a low cut top or dress examples include nightclub wear and formal dresses in movies and theatre an actress who has smaller breasts than the character she is playing may need to use cleavage enhancement techniques to present the image required by the role for example julia roberts was required to wear a waterpadded bra for the movie erin brockovich in order to increase her apparent breast size and enhance her cleavage  adult females who have small breasts often find it challenging to find dresses that fit well off the rack bra pad inserts can be slipped into most bras to add fullness help fill out the cup adult females who have uneven breasts which results in poorly fitting dresses and swimwear use bra pad inserts to even out breast shape male crossdressers often want to create the illusion of female cleavage as part of making their body appear feminine many crossdressers believe that displaying a convincing cleavage will distract attention from flaws in their appearance and will improve their ability to pass  because most such males have little or no breast tissue some form of skin pulling technique is used often in conjunction with the use of makeup to increase the illusion cleavage enhancing bras are most commonly referred to as pushup bras they vary in design from unpadded designs which simply push the breasts towards each other through to moulded cup designs with large moulded pads in the bottom and outside of the cups to force the breasts upwards and inwards some cleavage enhancing bra designs incorporate removable pads to allow the extent of the pushup effect to be altered by the insertion or removal of pads the shapewear cleavage enhancing bra is a modern take on the bustier with pull strings for cleavage adjustment they work by pulling the bust together and holding in the surrounding torso and side bulges this gives an overall more sleek look aimed at complementing fashion wear padding used in bras has been manufactured in a variety of styles including sealed bags containing air water or some form of liquid or gel and from semirigid materials such as moulded polyurethane foam rubber falsies are small pads similar to the removable pads sold with some pushup bras falsies made from silicone gel are also sometimes referred to colloquially as chicken fillets  various methods are used to pull loose skin from the front of each breast towards the centre to create two vertical bulges of skin then imitation breasts such as mastectomy breast forms are worn outside those skin bulges such that only the inside edges of those bulges are visible past the bra top or dress taping involves the use of some form of adhesive tape applied to towards the bottom of the breasts to pull them together   types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape some also use a strip of moleskin across under the breasts with tape at the ends to hold it in place taping can also involve the use of a very thin and flexible selfadhesive tape shaped like a horseshoe with which it is possible to position the nipples upwards by several centimeters these tapes lift the breasts from the top most adhesive breast lifts are available in cup ad use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes blisters and skin being torn off   semirigid pieces of material such as plastic can be applied to the skin using surgical tape surgical adhesive or specialist adhesives normally used to glue mastectomy breast forms to the body  even a general purpose craft glue can be used for this purpose  underbras are commercially manufactured garments designed to pull the skin towards the centre these garments look somewhat like a conventional bra having a band and shoulder straps like a bra as with other designs breast forms and a bra are worn over the garment to complete the illusion of breasts one disadvantage of these designs is that with a bra over the top there are two pairs of bra straps and two underbust bands that can potentially look like the person is wearing two bras the design of these garments limits clothing styles to those that will adequately cover the straps preventing for example the use of halterneck garments one such design is called a diva it has conventional bra style hookandeye fasteners at the front instead of the back and has cups that curve inwards are fairly rigid and covered on the inside with a material that grips the skin to hold it in place using pressure rather than adhesive  another similar device is called the busty cleavage creator it uses a pair of crossed velcro straps on the front to pull the skin towards the centre leaving an uneven surface for the breast forms to sit against  adhesive gel bras consist of two shaped silicon gel filled bra cups that stick to the skin of the breast using builtin reusable adhesive then clip together to pull the breasts together  these can be used as falsies that wont slide around in a bra and can be used to enhance cleavage on a woman by using them in their originally designed manner for cleavage enhancement purposes these gel cups can be applied towards the bottom and outside of the breasts and then the clip done up to pull the skin together they have advantages over techniques of pulling the skin forward as there are no straps and they are widely and cheaply available some users deliberately wear the cups upside down by swapping the cups lefttoright making cleavage appear deeper and the breasts look fuller alongside the cleavage using makeup is achieved using shading effects the middle of the cleavage is made to look deeper by using a darker makeup colour than the base colour of the skin in a vertical line between the breasts while the most prominent areas of the breasts either side of the cleavage are made to look larger or more protruding by the use of a paler colour   sometimes the darker shade is extended in a y shape to add further emphasis to the roundness of the top of the breasts cleavage enhancement techniques do not always give the desired results using a skin pulling technique and pulling the skin too tightly or wearing a bra that is too small in the cup size will create excessive bulges either side of the cleavage  which will look obviously pushed out of shape either pulling the skin too little or showing too much of the peaks of the bulges created by a skin pulling technique may cause the curvature of the cleavage to be visibly different from the curve that would exist for real breasts of the same size the parts of the breasts visible in the cleavage will appear to curve away in a manner that does not line up with the rest of the breasts excessive or poorly applied makeup may look obviously false and may detract from an otherwise effective cleavage illusion a cleavage top is a prosthesis designed to provide what is claimed by the manufacturers to be a realistic looking breast and cleavage allowing someone with little or no breast tissue to wear low cut tops and more revealing clothing while appearing to have large breasts unlike breast prostheses and enhancers that need to be completely hidden and require the use of cleavage enhancement techniques to display cleavage cleavage tops provide a full bust that can be mostly exposed without the edges of the prosthesis showing cleavage tops incorporate a pair of breast prostheses in a onepiece skin coloured garment that is designed to provide the illusion of natural cleavage such garments have the disadvantage of having a visible top edge at the neck which requires the wearing of a choker or similar necklace to hide the top edge of the garment the edges of the breast prostheses are often distinguishable through the thin outer cover they are usually made from either latex or silicone and most often are made to measure these prosthetics are marketed to prehormonal transwomen and males who crossdress

V an udder is an organ formed of the mammary glands of female quadruped mammals particularly ruminants such as cattle goats sheep and deer  the udder is a single mass hanging beneath the animal consisting of pairs of mammary glands in cattle there are normally two pairs in sheep goats and deer there is one pair and in some animals such as pigs there are many pairs in animals with udders the mammary glands develop on the milk line near the groin and mammary glands that develop on the chest such as in humans and apes are generally referred to as breasts  udder care and hygiene in cows is important in milking aiding uninterrupted and untainted milk production and preventing mastitis products exist to soothe the chapped skin of the udder this helps prevent bacterial infection and reduces irritation during milking by the cups and so the cow is less likely to kick the cups off sometimes cows udders are bad and try to team up with adele so be careful

V the pancreas \u02c8pæ\u014bkri\u0259s is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates in humans it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach it is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones including insulin glucagon somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood the pancreas is also a digestive organ secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine these enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates proteins and lipids in the chyme   the pancreas is an endocrine organ that lies in the abdomen specifically the upper left abdomen it is found behind the stomach with the head of the pancreas surrounded by the duodenum  the pancreas is about 15cm 6in long  anatomically the pancreas is divided into a head which rests within the concavity of the duodenum a body lying behind the base of the stomach and a tail which ends abutting the spleen the neck of the pancreas lies between the body and head and lies anterior to the superior mesenteric artery and vein the head of the pancreas surrounds these two vessels and a small uncinate process emerges from the lower part of the head lying behind the superior mesenteric artery  the pancreas is a secretory structure with an internal hormonal role endocrine and an external digestive role exocrine it has two main ducts the main pancreatic duct and the accessory pancreatic duct these drain enzymes through the ampulla of vater into the duodenum  the upper margin of the pancreas is blunt and flat to the right narrow and sharp to the left near the tail it begins on the right in the omental tuber and is in relation with the celiac artery from which the hepatic artery courses to the right just above the gland while the lienal artery runs toward the left in a groove along this border the lower margin of the pancreas separates the posterior from the inferior surface the superior mesenteric vessels emerge under its right extremity the frontal margin of the pancreas separates the anterior from the inferior surface of the pancreas and along this border the two layers of the transverse mesocolon diverge from one another one passing upward over the frontal surface the other backward over the inferior surface the inferior surface of the pancreas is narrow on the right but broader on the left and is covered by peritoneum it lies upon the duodenojejunal flexure and on some coils of the jejunum its left extremity rests on the left colic flexure the anterior surface of the pancreas faces the front of the abdomen most of the right half of this surface is in contact with the transverse colon with only areolar tissue intervening from its upper part it joins to the neck of the pancreas at a wellmarked prominence the omental tuber which abuts the lesser omentum its right edge is marked by a groove for the gastroduodenal artery the lower part of the right half below the transverse colon is covered by peritoneum continuous with the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon and is in contact with the coils of the small intestine the superior mesenteric artery passes down in front of the left half across the uncinate process the superior mesenteric vein runs upward on the right side of the artery and behind the neck joins with the lienal vein to form the portal vein the pancreas receives blood from branches of both the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery the splenic artery runs along the top margin of the pancreas and supplies the neck body and tail of the pancreas through its pancreatic branches the largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery runs along the anterior and posterior surfaces of the head of the pancreas at its border with the duodenum these supply the head of the pancreas  the body and neck of the pancreas drain into the splenic vein the head drains into the superior mesenteric and portal veins  the pancreas contains tissue with an endocrine and exocrine role and this division is also visible when the pancreas is viewed under a microscope  the tissues with an endocrine role can be seen under staining as lightlystained clusters of cells called pancreatic islets also called islets of langerhans  darkerstaining cells form clusters called acini which are arranged in lobes separated by a thin fibrous barrier the secretory cells of each acinus surround a small intercalated duct because of their secretory function these cells have many small granules of zymogens that are visible the intercalated ducts drains into larger ducts within the lobule and finally interlobular ducts the ducts are lined by a single layer of columnar cells with increasing diameter several layers of columnar cells may be seen  the size of the pancreas varies considerably  several anatomical variations exist relating to the embryological development of the two buds of the pancreas the pancreas develops as two buds on either side of the duodenum the ventral bud eventually rotates to lie next to the dorsal bud eventually fusing if the two buds do not fuse a pancreas may exist as two separate lobes this is also called pancreatic divisum if the ventral bud does not fully rotate an annular pancreas may exist this is where sections of the pancreas completely encircle the duodenum and may even lead to duodenal atresia  an accessory pancreatic duct may exist if the main duct of pancreas does not regress  the pancreas forms from the embryonic foregut and is therefore of endodermal origin pancreatic development begins with the formation of a ventral and a dorsal pancreatic bud each structure communicates with the foregut through a duct the dorsal pancreatic bud forms the head body and tail whereas the ventral pancreatic bud forms the uncinate process  differential rotation and fusion of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds results in the formation of the definitive pancreas  as the duodenum rotates to the right it carries with it the ventral pancreatic bud and common bile duct upon reaching its final destination the ventral pancreatic bud fuses with the much larger dorsal pancreatic bud at this point of fusion the main ducts of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fuse forming the main pancreatic duct the duct of the dorsal bud regresses leaving the main pancreatic duct  differentiation of cells of the pancreas proceeds through two different pathways corresponding to the dual endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas in progenitor cells of the exocrine pancreas important molecules that induce differentiation include follistatin fibroblast growth factors and activation of the notch receptor system  development of the exocrine acini progresses through three successive stages these are the predifferentiated protodifferentiated and differentiated stages which correspond to undetectable low and high levels of digestive enzyme activity respectively the multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells have the capacity to differentiate into all the pancreatic cells acinar cells endocrine cells and ductal cells these progenitor cells are characterised by the coexpression of the transcription factors pdx1 and nkx61 under the influence of neurogenin3 and isl1 but in the absence of notch receptor signaling these cells differentiate to form two lines of committed endocrine precursor cells the first line under the direction of a pax gene forms \u03b1 and \u03b3 cells which produce glucagon and pancreatic polypeptides respectively the second line influenced by pax6 produces beta cells \u03b2 and delta cells \u03b4 which secrete insulin and somatostatin respectively insulin and glucagon can be detected in the human fetal circulation by the fourth or fifth month of fetal development  the pancreas is a dualfunction gland having features of both endocrine and exocrine glands the part of the pancreas with endocrine function is made up of approximately 3 million  cell clusters called pancreatic islets these small micro organs are arranged along the pancreas in the form of density routes  four main cell types exist in the islets they are relatively difficult to distinguish using standard staining techniques but they can be classified by their secretion \u03b1 alpha cells secrete glucagon increase glucose in blood \u03b2 beta cells secrete insulin decrease glucose in blood \u03b4 delta cells secrete somatostatin regulatesstops \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells and pp cells or \u03b3 gamma cells secrete pancreatic polypeptide  the islets are a compact collection of endocrine cells arranged in clusters and cords and are crisscrossed by a dense network of capillaries the capillaries of the islets are lined by layers of endocrine cells in direct contact with vessels and most endocrine cells are in direct contact with blood vessels either by cytoplasmic processes or by direct apposition according to the volume the body by alan e nourse  the islets are busily manufacturing their hormone and generally disregarding the pancreatic cells all around them as though they were located in some completely different part of the body the pancreatic islets play an imperative role in glucose metabolism and regulation of blood glucose concentration the pancreas also functions as an exocrine gland that assists the digestive system it secretes pancreatic fluid that contains digestive enzymes that pass to the small intestine these enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates proteins and lipids fats in the chyme in humans the secretory activity of the pancreas is regulated directly via the effect of hormones in the blood on the pancreatic islets and indirectly through the effect of the autonomic nervous system on the blood flow  the exocrine component of the pancreas often called simply the exocrine pancreas is the portion of the pancreas that performs exocrine functions it has ducts that are arranged in clusters called acini singular acinus pancreatic secretions are secreted into the lumen of the acinus and then accumulate in intralobular ducts that drain to the main pancreatic duct which drains directly into the duodenum control of the exocrine function of the pancreas is via the hormones gastrin cholecystokinin and secretin which are secreted by cells in the stomach and duodenum in response to distension andor food and which cause secretion of pancreatic juices there are two main classes of exocrine pancreatic secretions pancreatic secretions from ductal cells contain bicarbonate ions and are alkaline in order to neutralize the acidic chyme that the stomach churns out the pancreas is also the main source of enzymes for digesting fats lipids and proteins the enzymes that digest polysaccharides by contrast are primarily produced by the walls of the intestines the cells are filled with secretory granules containing the precursor digestive enzymes the major proteases which the pancreas secretes are trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen secreted to a lesser degree are pancreatic lipase and pancreatic amylase the pancreas also secretes phospholipase a2 lysophospholipase and cholesterol esterase the precursor enzymes termed zymogens or proenzymes are inactive variants of the enzymes thus autodegradation which can lead to pancreatitis is avoided once released in the intestine the enzyme enteropeptidase formerly and incorrectly called enterokinase present in the intestinal mucosa activates trypsinogen by cleaving it to form trypsin the free trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen as well as chymotrypsinogen to its active form chymotrypsin a puncture of the pancreas which may lead to the secretion of digestive enzymes such as lipase and amylase into the abdominal cavity as well as subsequent pancreatic selfdigestion and digestion and damage to organs within the abdomen generally requires prompt and experienced medical intervention it is possible for one to live without a pancreas provided that the person takes insulin for proper regulation of blood glucose concentration and pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion  inflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis pancreatitis is most often associated with recurrent gallstones or chronic alcohol use although a variety of other causes including measles mumps some medications the congenital condition alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency and even some scorpion stings may cause pancreatitis pancreatitis is likely to cause intense pain in the central abdomen that often radiates to the back and may be associated with jaundice in addition due to causing problems with fat digestion and bilirubin excretion pancreatitis often presents with pale stools and dark urine  in pancreatitis enzymes of the exocrine pancreas damage the structure and tissue of the pancreas detection of some of these enzymes such as amylase and lipase in the blood along with symptoms and findings on xray are often used to indicate that a person has pancreatitis a person with pancreatitis is also at risk of shock pancreatitis is often managed medically with analgesics removal of gallstones or treatment of other causes and monitoring to ensure a patient does not develop shock  pancreatic cancers particularly the most common type pancreatic adenocarcinoma remain very difficult to treat and are mostly diagnosed only at a stage that is too late for surgery which is the only curative treatment pancreatic cancer is rare in those younger than 40 and the median age of diagnosis is 71  risk factors include smoking obesity diabetes and certain rare genetic conditions including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer among others  about 25 of cases are attributable to tobacco smoking  while 510 of cases are linked to inherited genes  there are several types of pancreatic cancer involving both the endocrine and exocrine tissue pancreatic adenocarcinoma which affects the exocrine part of the pancreas is by far the most common form the many types of pancreatic endocrine tumors are all uncommon or rare and have varied outlooks however the incidence of these cancers has been rising sharply it is not clear to what extent this reflects increased detection especially through medical imaging of tumors that would be very slow to develop insulinomas largely benign and gastrinomas are the most common types  in the united states pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of deaths due to cancer  the disease occurs more often in the developed world which had 68 of new cases in 2012  pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has poor outcomes with the average percentage alive for at least one and five years after diagnosis being 25 and 5 respectively   in localized disease where the cancer is small  2cm the number alive at five years is approximately 20  for those with neuroendocrine cancers the number alive after five years is much better at 65 varying considerably with type  diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the insulinsecreting cells of the pancreas people with type 1 diabetes therefore lack the insulin needed to keep blood sugar levels within optimal ranges if left untreated this leads to high blood sugar and the array of associated symptoms type 1 diabetes develops in people of all ages but is most often diagnosed before adulthood for type 1 diabetics insulin injections are critical for survival  diabetes mellitus type 2 is the most common form of diabetes the causes for high blood sugar in this form of diabetes usually are a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion with both genetic and environmental factors playing an important role in the development of the disease the management of type 2 diabetes relies on a series of changes in diet and physical activity with the purpose of reducing blood sugar levels to normal ranges and increasing insulin sensitivity  biguanides such as metformin are also used as part of the treatment along with insulin therapy  the pancreas was first identified for western civilization by herophilus 335280 bc a greek anatomist and surgeon only a few hundred years later rufus of ephesus another greek anatomist gave the pancreas its name etymologically the term pancreas a modern latin adaptation of greek \u03c0\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2  \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd all whole and \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 flesh  originally means sweetbread  although literally meaning allflesh presumably because of its fleshy consistency it was only in 1889 when oskar minkowski discovered that removing the pancreas from a dog caused it to become diabetic insulin was later discovered by frederick banting and charles herbert best in 1921 the organ is mentioned prominently in the 1992 film encino man pauly shores character stoney often refers to the organ in unrelated contexts perhaps demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of what the pancreas does pancreatic tissue is present in all vertebrate species but its precise form and arrangement vary widely there may be up to three separate pancreases two of which arise from ventral buds and the other dorsally in most species including humans these fuse in the adult but there are several exceptions even when a single pancreas is present two or three pancreatic ducts may persist each draining separately into the duodenum or equivalent part of the foregut birds for example typically have three such ducts  in teleosts and a few other species such as rabbits there is no discrete pancreas at all with pancreatic tissue being distributed diffusely across the mesentery and even within other nearby organs such as the liver or spleen in a few teleost species the endocrine tissue has fused to form a distinct gland within the abdominal cavity but otherwise it is distributed among the exocrine components the most primitive arrangement however appears to be that of lampreys and lungfish in which pancreatic tissue is found as a number of discrete nodules within the wall of the gut itself with the exocrine portions being little different from other glandular structures of the intestine  the celiac artery and its branches the stomach has been raised and the peritoneum removed lymphatics of stomach etc the stomach has been turned upward transverse section through the middle

V a gastric chief cell or peptic cell or gastric zymogenic cell is a type of cell in the stomach that releases pepsinogen and gastric lipase and is the cell responsible for secretion of chymosin in ruminants  the cell stains basophilic upon he staining due to the large proportion of rough endoplasmic reticulum in its cytoplasm gastric chief cells are generally located deep in the mucosal layer of the stomach lining chief cells release the zymogen enzyme precursor pepsinogen when stimulated by a variety of factors including cholinergic activity from the vagus nerve and acidic condition in the stomach gastrin and secretin may also act as secretagogues  it works in conjunction with the parietal cell which releases gastric acid converting the pepsinogen into pepsin   the terms chief cell and zymogenic cell are often used without the word gastric to name this type of cell however those terms can also be used to describe other cell types for example parathyroid chief cells chief cells are also known as peptic cells

V topfreedom in canada has largely been an attempt to combat the interpretation of indecency laws that considered a womans breasts to be indecent and therefore their exhibition in public an offence in british columbia it is a historical issue dating back to the 1930s and the public protests against materialistic lifestyle held by the radical religious sect of the freedomites whose pacifist beliefs led to their exodus from russia to canada at the end of the 19th century the svobodniki became famous for their public nudity mostly for their nude marches in public and the acts of arson committed also in the nude    in canada the law on public decency is found in sections 173 and 174 of the criminal code  however what constitutes an indecent act is not defined and is open to interpretation by the courts in 1991 toplessness as an indecent act was challenged by gwen jacob in guelph ontario who removed her shirt and was charged with indecency part of her defense was the double standards between men and women although she was convicted this was overturned by the court of appeal this case determined that being topless is not indecent within the meaning of the criminal code however it did not establish any constitutional right of equality this case subsequently led to the acquittal of women in british columbia and saskatchewan who faced similar charges although each province and territory technically reserves its right to interpret the law as it pleases the ontario case has proved influential since the matter has not been determined by the supreme court of canada it is still possible that a woman could be convicted elsewhere in canada but interpretation of moral law in canada has become increasingly liberalised  there do not appear to have been any further women charged in canada since these cases were decided topfreedom is allowed in ontario set by the precedent in the case of gwen jacob the acting executive director of municipal licensing and standards said that while theres no bylaw that governs toplessness it is legal for women to go topless on the streets of toronto according to a national post article he added that parks require clothing except for example the clothing optional hanlans point beach  on july 19 1991 a very hot and humid day gwen jacob a university of guelph student was arrested after walking in a street in guelph ontario while topless after removing her shirt when the temperature was 33c 91f and was charged with indecency under section 1731a of the criminal code police stated that they acted following a complaint from a woman who was upset that one of her children had seen gwen jacob jacob stated she did it because men were doing it and she wanted to draw attention to the double standard she was found guilty and fined 75 in her defence she argued that breasts were merely fatty tissue in finding her guilty the judge stated that breasts were part of the female body that is sexually stimulating to men both by sight and touch and therefore should not be exposed  she appealed but her appeal was dismissed by the ontario court general division and she further appealed to the ontario court of appeal  in the meantime protests against jacobs arrest and conviction led to further charges against others in particular r v arnold  but in this case mcgowan pcj applied the test of community standard of tolerance following butler stating that the action of being topless caused no harm and thus did not exceed community standards of tolerance indeed she commented   undoubtedly most women would not engage in this conduct for there are many who believe that deportment of this nature is tasteless and does not enhance the cause of women equally undoubtedly there are men today who cannot perceive of womans breasts in any context other than sexual it is important to reaffirm that the canadian standards of tolerance test does not rely upon these attitudes for its formulation i have no doubt that aside from their personal opinions of this behaviour the majority of canadians would conclude that it is not beyond their level of tolerance gwen jacob was acquitted on december 9 1996 by the ontario court of appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent the court held that there was nothing degrading or dehumanizing in what the appellant did the scope of her activity was limited and was entirely noncommercial no one who was offended was forced to continue looking at her and that furthermore the community standard of tolerance when all of the relevant circumstances are taken into account was not exceeded it is important to note that although jacob claimed she had a constitutional right the court did not address this  the ontario government decided not to appeal the case to the supreme court of canada and thus it has remained the prevailing interpretation of the criminal code in ontario since then the court ruling has been tested and upheld several times r v jacob has been cited in similar decisions in other provinces and by the supreme court of canada in r v labaye and is taught in criminal law courses  another important distinction is that of whether the nature of the act is commercial or not in jacob the court stressed that it was not in contrast in of r v gowan  gowan a known sex worker under the impression that exposing the breasts was now legal solicited clients at an intersection motioned to her breasts and called out do you want to fuck she was consequently charged with and convicted of engaging in an indecent act under the same section as in jacob 173 1 a the decision by the ontario government not to appeal to the supreme court was based on the likelihood that the court would not grant leave this caused considerable public concern as well as attempts by municipalities to preempt the law by passing more restrictive bylaws uniform law conference of canada 1999 nevertheless the ontario government did contact the federal government regarding amending the law to make such actions clearly illegal  this was not pursued while the community standards test is not an immutable part of indecency jurisdiction community tolerance is likely to be partly determined by the degree to which the public is exposed to top freedom on a regular basis jacobs victory is now celebrated annually in guelph  2011 marked the 20th anniversary of gwen jacobs walk and to celebrate some students reenacted it  despite this women still faced discrimination in public facilities in 1997 fatima pereira henson was charged with trespassing for swimming topless in cambridge but the charges were dropped she was then charged again and also this was dropped by the crown so the city initiated its own prosecution although this too was dropped a bylaw specifically prohibiting topfree swimming was passed eventually her efforts led to a new bylaw allowing this  in toronto in 2011 a go topless day rally was refused a permit to meet in a park so they marched down the streets with a police escort  in 2000 a similar case to jacob resulted in acquittal linda meyer was a topfree activist inspired by the gwen jacob case who appeared in a number of public venues topless a bylaw in the municipality of maple ridge stated females over the age of 8 years shall fully cover all portions of their nipples and aureole with opaque apparel on july 1 1997 linda meyer went to the swimming pool in the bottom half of her bikini some parents complained and she was charged  but the judge in this case justice holmes voided the by law stating inter alia  55 in r v jacob supra a woman who walked barebreasted on a city street and then reclined topfree on the front step to her home was acquitted on appeal of committing an indecent act the court found the baring of her breasts was not harmful to anyone there was nothing degrading or dehumanizing in her conduct the court noted anyone who was offended was not forced to look 57 i do not find in the evidence support for the view that the parks could not operate in orderly fashion if a female were to bare her breasts in a circumstance that did not offend criminal laws of nudity the evidence suggests the section 3a amendment to the park bylaw was more a reaction to a frustration that the criminal law was not supporting the moral standards in regard to females who chose to bare their breasts in public that some maple ridge citizens desired meyer subsequently tested the decision in a number of locations winning acknowledgement from the vancouver police department that women would not be charged for appearing top free in public however she has been harassed by police on a number of occasions  in 2008 vancouver british columbia was a location of the world naked bike ride  in 1997 a 64yearold woman evangeline godron together with kathleen rice sunbathed topless in a regina park and were charged for doing so on july 22 a judge in the provincial court ruled that their behaviour did not violate community standards however she and other women then swam in a pool without a top again parents complained godron was arrested for assault because she refused to leave the pool when requested although she appealed this she was unsuccessful the case was appealed to the supreme court of canada which declined to hear it however this was a question of assault not of indecency  a 1992 poll showed that 62 of canadians were opposed to women having topfreedom with women being more likely to be opposed  a more detailed survey was undertaken in 1998  and a detailed analysis was published by fischtein and colleagues in 2005 fischtein et al 2005 this showed context to be important for instance 72 were opposed to being topless on a city street 62 in parks but only 48 on beaches in all cases women were more opposed to toplessness the canadian topfree equal rights association tera assists women in both canada and the united states who are prosecuted for being topless in situations whereas men are not  it does not advocate toplessness but promotes the concept of freedom of choice of the individual woman and the desexualisation of breasts

V brocas area or the broca area bro\u028a\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0 or \u02c8bro\u028ak\u0259 is a region in the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere usually the left of the hominid brain  with functions linked to speech production language processing has been linked to brocas area since pierre paul broca reported impairments in two patients  they had lost the ability to speak after injury to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the brain  since then the approximate region he identified has become known as brocas area and the deficit in language production as brocas aphasia also called expressive aphasia brocas area is now typically defined in terms of the pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus represented in brodmanns cytoarchitectonic map as areas 44 and 45 of the dominant hemisphere  studies of chronic aphasia have implicated an essential role of brocas area in various speech and language functions further fmri studies have also identified activation patterns in brocas area associated with various language tasks however slow destruction of the brocas area by brain tumors can leave speech relatively intact suggesting its functions can shift to nearby areas in the brain    brocas area is often identified by visual inspection of the topography of the brain either by macrostructural landmarks such as sulci or by the specification of coordinates in a particular reference space the currently used talairach and tournoux atlas projects brodmanns cytoarchitectonic map onto a template brain because brodmanns parcelation was based on subjective visual inspection of cytoarchitectonic borders and also brodmann analyzed only one hemisphere of one brain the result is imprecise further because of considerable variability across brains in terms of shape size and position relative to sulcal and gyral structure a resulting localization precision is limited  nevertheless brocas area in the left hemisphere and its homologue in the right hemisphere are designations usually used to refer to pars triangularis ptr and pars opercularis pop of the inferior frontal gyrus the ptr and pop are defined by structural landmarks that only probabilistically divide the inferior frontal gyrus into anterior and posterior cytoarchitectonic areas of 45 and 44 respectively by brodmanns classification scheme  area 45 receives more afferent connections from prefrontal cortex the superior temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus compared to area 44 which tends to receive more afferent connections from motor somatosensory and inferior parietal regions  the differences between area 45 and 44 in cytoarchitecture and in connectivity suggest that these areas might perform different functions indeed recent neuroimaging studies have shown that the ptr and pop corresponding to areas 45 and 44 respectively play different functional roles in the human with respect to language comprehension and action recognitionunderstanding  for a long time it was assumed that the role of brocas area was more devoted to language production than language comprehension however recent evidence demonstrates that brocas area also plays a significant role in language comprehension patients with lesions in brocas area who exhibit agrammatical speech production also show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences  also a number of neuroimaging studies have implicated an involvement of brocas area particularly of the pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus during the processing of complex sentences  further it has recently been found in functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri experiments involving highly ambiguous sentences result in a more activated inferior frontal gyrus  therefore the activity level in the inferior frontal gyrus and the level of lexical ambiguity are directly proportional to each other because of the increased retrieval demands associated with highly ambiguous content recent experiments have indicated that brocas area is involved in various cognitive and perceptual tasks one important contribution of brodmanns area 44 is also found in the motorrelated processes observation of meaningful hand shadows resembling moving animals activates frontal language area demonstrating that brocas area indeed plays a role in interpreting action of others  an activation of ba 44 was also reported during execution of grasping and manipulation  it has been speculated that because speechassociated gestures could possibly reduce lexical or sentential ambiguity comprehension should improve in the presence of speechassociated gestures as a result of improved comprehension the involvement of brocas area should be reduced  many neuroimaging studies have also shown activation of brocas area when representing meaningful arm gestures a recent study has shown evidence that word and gesture are related at the level of translation of particular gesture aspects such as its motor goal and intention  this finding helps explain why when this area is defective those who use sign language also suffer from language deficits  this finding that aspects of gestures are translated in words within brocas area also explains language development in terms of evolution indeed many authors have proposed that speech evolved from a primitive communication that arose from gestures   see below damage to brocas area is commonly associated with telegraphic like speech made up of functional vocabulary for example a person with brocas aphasia may say something like drive store mom meaning to say my mom drove me to the store today therefore the content of the information is correct but the grammar and fluidity of the sentence is missing  the essential role of the brocas area in speech production has been questioned since it can be destroyed while leaving language nearly intact in one case of a computer engineer a slowgrowing glioma tumor was removed the tumor and the surgery destroyed the left inferior and middle frontal gyrus the head of the caudate nucleus the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the anterior insula however there were minimal language problems three months after removal and the individual returned to his professional work these minor problems include the inability to create syntactically complex sentences including more than two subjects multiple causal conjunctions or reported speech these were explained by researchers as due to working memory problems they also attributed his lack of problems to extensive compensatory mechanisms enabled by neural plasticity in the nearby cerebral cortex and a shift of some functions to the homologous area in the right hemisphere  communication both verbal and nonverbal requires that the interacting individuals stay tuned to one another mirror neurons were discovered in the 1990s in frontal area f5 of the monkey cortex these neurons are active during execution of objectrelated hand actions but they are also active importantly when the monkey is just observing similar acts for example the mirror neurons are activated when the monkey takes a raisin from a tray and also when he views another monkey or the human experimenter doing the same no information is yet available about possible hemispheric lateralization of the monkey mirror neurons mirror neurons have visuomotor properties being sensitive to goalrelated motor acts but they can also be activated by sounds that imply actions importantly the mirror neurons do not only react to visual input and then project via some transformational step to motoroutputrelated neurons but are also part of a system that forms a neuronal representation of the observed motor acts similar to f5 the rostral part of the inferior parietal cortex contains neurons that are active during action observation and execution this region receives input from the sts which is known to contain neurons responding to biological motion   a speech disorder known as stuttering is seen to be associated with underactivity in brocas area  aphasia is an acquired language disorder affecting all modalities such as writing reading speaking and listening and results from brain damage it is often a chronic condition that creates changes in all areas of ones life  patients with expressive aphasia also known as brocas aphasia are individuals who know what they want to say they just cannot get it out  they are typically able to comprehend words and sentences with a simple syntactic structure see above but are more or less unable to generate fluent speech other symptoms that may be present include problems with fluency articulation wordfinding word repetition and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences both orally and in writing  this specific group of symptoms distinguishes those who have expressive aphasia from individuals with other types of aphasia there are several distinct types of aphasia and each type is characterized by a different set of language deficits although those who have expressive aphasia tend to retain good spoken language comprehension other types of aphasia can render patients completely unable to understand any language at all unable to understand any spoken language auditory verbal agnosia    whereas still other types preserve language comprehension but with deficits people with expressive aphasia may struggle less with reading and writing see alexia than those with other types of aphasia  although individuals with expressive aphasia tend to have a good ability to selfmonitor their language output they hear what they say and make corrections other types of aphasics can seem entirely unaware of their language deficits in the classical sense expressive aphasia is the result of injury to brocas area it is often the case that lesions in specific brain areas cause specific dissociable symptoms  although case studies show there is not always a onetoone mapping between lesion location and aphasic symptoms  the correlation between damage to certain specific brain areas usually in the left hemisphere and the development of specific types of aphasia makes it possible to deduce albeit very roughly the location of a suspected brain lesion based only on the presence and severity of a certain type of aphasia though this is complicated by the possibility that a patient may have damage to a number of brain areas and may exhibit symptoms of more than one type of aphasia the examination of lesion data in order to deduce which brain areas are essential in the normal functioning of certain aspects of cognition is called the deficitlesion method this method is especially important in the branch of neuroscience known as aphasiology cognitive science  to be specific cognitive neuropsychology  are branches of neuroscience that also make extensive use of the deficitlesion method  it is presently perceived that the relationship between brocas area and brocas aphasia is not as consistent as once thought  lesions to brocas area alone dont result in a brocas aphasia nor do brocas aphasic patients necessarily have lesions in brocas area  truth be told lesions to brocas area alone are known to produce just a transient mutism that resolves inside 36 weeks this discovery suggests that brocas area may be included in some aspect of verbalization or articulation however it does not address its part in sentence comprehension still brocas area frequently emerges in functional imaging studies of sentence processing  however it also becomes activated in wordlevel tasks  this suggests that brocas area is not dedicated to sentence processing but supports a function common to both in fact brocas area can show activation in such nonlinguistic tasks as imagery of motion  considering the hypothesis that brocas area may be most involved in articulation its activation in all of these tasks may be due to subjects covert articulation while formulating a response despite this caveat a consensus seems to be forming that whatever role brocas area may play it may relate to known working memory functions of the frontal areas it should be noted that there is a wide distribution of talairach coordinates   reported in the functional imaging literature that are referred to as part of brocas area the processing of a passive voice sentence for example may require working memory to assist in the temporary retention of information while other relevant parts of the sentence are being manipulated ie to resolve the assignment of thematic roles to arguments miyake carpenter and just have proposed that sentence processing relies on such general verbal working memory mechanisms while caplan and waters consider brocas area to be involved in working memory specifically for syntactic processing friederici 2002 breaks brocas area into its component regions and suggests that brodmanns area 44 is involved in working memory for both phonological   and syntactic structure this area becomes active first for phonology and later for syntax as the time course for the comprehension process unfolds brodmanns area 45 together with brodmanns area 47 is viewed as being specifically involved in working memory for semantic features and thematic structure where processes of syntactic reanalysis and repair are required these areas come online after brodmanns area 44 has finished its processing role and where comprehension of complex sentences must rely on general memory resources all of these theories indicate a move towards a view that syntactic comprehension problems arise from a computational rather than a conceptual deficit newer theories are taking a more dynamic view of how the brain integrates different linguistic and cognitive components and are examining the time course of these operations neurocognitive studies have already implicated frontal areas adjacent to brocas area as important for working memory in nonlinguistic as well as linguistic tasks  cabeza and nybergs analysis of imaging studies of working memory supports the view that ba4547 is recruited for selecting or comparing information while ba946 might be more involved in the manipulation of information in working memory since large lesions are typically required to produce a brocas aphasia it is likely that these regions may also become compromised in some patients and may contribute to their comprehension deficits for complex morphosyntactic structures brocas area a key center in the linking phonemic sequences brocas area has been previously associated with a variety of processes including phonological segmentation syntactic processing and unification all of which involve segmenting and linking different types of linguistic information    although repeating and reading single words do not engage semantic and syntactic processing they do require an operation linking phonemic sequences with motor gestures findings indicate that this linkage is coordinated by brocas area through reciprocal interactions with temporal and frontal cortices responsible for phonemic and articulatory representations respectively including interactions with motor cortex before the actual act of speech based on these unique findings it has been proposed that brocas area is not the seat of articulation per se but rather is a key node in manipulating and forwarding neural information across largescale cortical networks responsible for key components of speech production in a recent study the preserved brains of both leborgne and lelong patients of broca were reinspected using highresolution volumetric mri the purpose of this study was to scan the brains in three dimensions and to identify the extent of both cortical and subcortical lesions in more detail the study also sought to locate the exact site of the lesion in the frontal lobe in relation to what is now called brocas area with the extent of subcortical involvement  leborgne was a patient of brocas almost completely unable to produce any words or phrases he was able to repetitively produce only the word tan after his death a lesion was discovered on the surface the left frontal lobe lelong was another patient of brocas he also exhibited reduced productive speech he could only say five words yes no three always and lelo a mispronunciation of his own name at autopsy a lesion was also found in the same region of lateral frontal lobe as in leborgne these two cases led broca to believe that speech was localized to this particular area examination of the brains of brocas two historic patients with highresolution mri has produced several interesting findings first the mri findings suggest that other areas besides brocas area may also have contributed to the patients reduced productive speech this finding is significant because it has been found that though lesions to brocas area alone can possibly cause temporary speech disruption they do not result in severe speech arrest therefore there is a possibility that the aphasia denoted by broca as an absence of productive speech also could have been influenced by the lesions in the other region  another interesting finding is that the region which was once considered to be critical for speech by broca is not precisely the same region as what is now known as brocas area this study provides further evidence to support the claim that language and cognition are far more complicated than once thought and involve various networks of brain regions  the pursuit of a satisfying theory that addresses the origin of language in humans has led to the consideration of a number of evolutionary models these models attempt to show how modern language might have evolved and a common feature of many of these theories is the idea that vocal communication was initially used to complement a far more dominant mode of communication through gesture human language might have evolved as the evolutionary refinement of an implicit communication system already present in lower primates based on a set of handmouth goaldirected action representations  handmouth goaldirected action representations is another way of saying gestural communication gestural language or communication through body language the recent finding that brocas area is active when people are observing others engaged in meaningful action is evidence in support of this idea it was hypothesized that a precursor to the modern brocas area was involved in translating gestures into abstract ideas by interpreting the movements of others as meaningful action with an intelligent purpose it is argued that over time the ability to predict the intended outcome and purpose of a set of movements eventually gave this area the capability to deal with truly abstract ideas and therefore eventually became capable of associating sounds words with abstract meanings the observation that frontal language areas are activated when people observe hand shadows  is further evidence that human language may have evolved from existing neural substrates that evolved for the purpose of gesture recognition  the study therefore claims that brocas area is the motor center for speech which assembles and decodes speech sounds in the same way it interprets body language and gestures consistent with this idea is that the neural substrate that regulated motor control in the common ancestor of apes and humans was most likely modified to enhance cognitive and linguistic ability  studies of speakers of american sign language and english suggest that the human brain recruited systems that had evolved to perform more basic functions much earlier these various brain circuits according to the authors were tapped to work together in creating language  another recent finding has showed significant areas of activation in subcortical and neocortical areas during the production of communicative manual gestures and vocal signals in chimpanzees  further the data indicating that chimpanzees intentionally produce manual gestures as well as vocal signals to communicate with humans suggests that the precursors to human language are present at both the behavioral and neuronanatomical levels more recently the neocortical distribution of activitydependent gene expression in marmosets provided direct evidence that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex which comprises brocas area in humans and has been associated with auditory processing of speciesspecific vocalizations and orofacial control in macaques is engaged during vocal output in a new world monkey   these findings putatively set the origin of vocalizationrelated neocortical circuits to at least 35 million years ago when the old and new world monkey lineages split brocas area shown in red animation approximate location of brocas area highlighted in gray arcuate fasciculus connects brocas area and wernickes

V the primary auditory cortex is the part of the temporal lobe that processes auditory information in humans and other vertebrates it is a part of the auditory system performing basic and higher functions in hearing  it is located bilaterally roughly at the upper sides of the temporal lobes  in humans on the superior temporal plane within the lateral fissure and comprising parts of heschls gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus including planum polare and planum temporale roughly brodmann areas 41 42 and partially 22  unilateral destruction results in slight hearing loss whereas bilateral destruction results in cortical deafness   the auditory cortex was previously subdivided into primary a1 and secondary a2 projection areas and further association areas the modern divisions of the auditory cortex are the core which includes a1 the belt and the parabelt the belt is the area immediately surrounding the core the parabelt is adjacent to the lateral side of the belt  besides receiving input from the ears via lower parts of the auditory system it also transmits signals back to these areas and is interconnected with other parts of the cerebral cortex data about the auditory cortex has been obtained through studies in cats macaques and other animals thus some knowledge about the human auditory cortex remains speculative  like many areas in the neocortex the functional properties of the adult primary auditory cortex a1 are highly dependent on the sounds encountered early in life this has been best studied using animal models especially cats and rats in the rat exposure to a single frequency during postnatal day p 11 to 13 can cause a 2fold expansion in the representation of that frequency in a1  importantly the change is persistent in that it lasts throughout the animals life and specific in that the same exposure outside of that period causes no lasting change in the tonotopy of a1 as with other primary sensory cortical areas auditory sensations reach perception only if received and processed by a cortical area evidence for this comes from lesion studies in human patients who have sustained damage to cortical areas through tumors or strokes  or from animal experiments in which cortical areas were deactivated by surgical lesions or other methods  damage to the primary auditory cortex in humans leads to a loss of any awareness of sound but an ability to react reflexively to sounds remains as there is a great deal of subcortical processing in the auditory brainstem and midbrain    neurons in the auditory cortex are organized according to the frequency of sound to which they respond best neurons at one end of the auditory cortex respond best to low frequencies neurons at the other respond best to high frequencies there are multiple auditory areas much like the multiple areas in the visual cortex which can be distinguished anatomically and on the basis that they contain a complete frequency map the purpose of this frequency map known as a tonotopic map is unknown and is likely to reflect the fact that the cochlea is arranged according to sound frequency the auditory cortex is involved in tasks such as identifying and segregating auditory objects and identifying the location of a sound in space human brain scans have indicated that a peripheral bit of this brain region is active when trying to identify musical pitch individual cells consistently get excited by sounds at specific frequencies or multiples of that frequency the auditory cortex plays an important yet ambiguous role in hearing when the auditory information passes into the cortex the specifics of what exactly takes place are unclear there is a large degree of individual variation in the auditory cortex as noted by biologist james beament who wrote the cortex is so complex that the most we may ever hope for is to understand it in principle since the evidence we already have suggests that no two cortices work in precisely the same way  in the hearing process multiple sounds are transduced simultaneously the role of the auditory system is to decide which components form the sound link many have surmised that this linkage is based on the location of sounds however there are numerous distortions of sound when reflected off different media which makes this thinking unlikely  the auditory cortex forms groupings based on fundamentals in music for example this would include harmony timing and pitch  the primary auditory cortex lies in the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal lobe and extends into the lateral sulcus and the transverse temporal gyri also called heschls gyri final sound processing is then performed by the parietaland frontal lobes of the human cerebral cortex animal studies indicate that auditory fields of the cerebral cortex receive ascending input from the auditory thalamus and that they are interconnected on the same and on the opposite cerebral hemispheres the auditory cortex is composed of fields which differ from each other in both structure and function  the number of fields varies in different species from as few as 2 in rodents to as many as 15 in the rhesus monkey the number location and organization of fields in the human auditory cortex are not known at this time what is known about the human auditory cortex comes from a base of knowledge gained from studies in mammals including primates used to interpret electrophysiological tests and functional imaging studies of the brain in humans when each instrument of a symphony orchestra or the jazz band plays the same note the quality of each sound is different  but the musician perceives each note as having the same pitch the neurons of the auditory cortex of the brain are able to respond to pitch studies in the marmoset monkey have shown that pitchselective neurons are located in a cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex this location of a pitchselective area has also been identified in recent functional imaging studies in humans   the primary auditory cortex is subject to modulation by numerous neurotransmitters including norepinephrine which has been shown to decrease cellular excitability in all layers of the temporal cortex alpha1 adrenergic receptor activation by norepinephrine decreases glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials at ampa receptors  the auditory cortex is the most highly organized processing unit of sound in the brain this cortex area is the neural crux of hearing andin humanslanguage and music the auditory cortex is divided into three separate parts the primary secondary and tertiary auditory cortex these structures are formed concentrically around one another with the primary cortex in the middle and the tertiary cortex on the outside the primary auditory cortex is tonotopically organized which means that neighboring cells in the cortex respond to neighboring frequencies  tonotopical mapping is preserved throughout most of the audition circuit the primary auditory cortex receives direct input from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and thus is thought to identify the fundamental elements of music such as pitch and loudness an evoked response study of congenitally deaf kittens by klinke et al utilized local field potentials to measure cortical plasticity in the auditory cortex these kittens were stimulated and measured against a control an unstimulated congenitally deaf cat cdc and normal hearing cats the field potentials measured for artificially stimulated cdc were eventually much stronger than that of a normal hearing cat  this finding accords with a study by eckart altenmullers in which it was observed that students who received musical instruction had greater cortical activation than those who did not  the auditory cortex has distinct responses to sounds in the gamma band when subjects are exposed to three or four cycles of a 40 hertz click an abnormal spike appears in the eeg data which is not present for other stimuli the spike in neuronal activity correlating to this frequency is not restrained to the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex it has been theorized that gamma frequencies are resonant frequencies of certain areas of the brain and appear to affect the visual cortex as well  gamma band activation 25 to 100hz has been shown to be present during the perception of sensory events and the process of recognition in a 2000 study by kneif and colleagues subjects were presented with eight musical notes to wellknown tunes such as yankee doodle and frère jacques randomly the sixth and seventh notes were omitted and an electroencephalogram as well as a magnetoencephalogram were each employed to measure the neural results specifically the presence of gamma waves induced by the auditory task at hand were measured from the temples of the subjects the osp response or omitted stimulus response was located in a slightly different position 7mm more anterior 13mm more medial and 13mm more superior in respect to the complete sets the osp recordings were also characteristically lower in gamma waves as compared to the complete musical set the evoked responses during the sixth and seventh omitted notes are assumed to be imagined and were characteristically different especially in the right hemisphere  the right auditory cortex has long been shown to be more sensitive to tonality while the left auditory cortex has been shown to be more sensitive to minute sequential differences in sound such as in speech tonality is represented in more places than just the auditory cortex one other specific area is the rostromedial prefrontal cortex rmpfc  janata et al in their 2002 study explored the areas of the brain which were active during tonality processing by means of the fmri technique the results of this experiment showed preferential bloodoxygenlevel dependent activation of specific voxels in rmpfc for specific tonal arrangements though these collections of voxels do not represent the same tonal arrangements between subjects or within subjects over multiple trials it is interesting and informative that rmpfc an area not usually associated with audition seems to code for immediate tonal arrangements in this respect rmpfc is a subsection of the medial prefrontal cortex which projects to many diverse areas including the amygdala and is thought to aid in the inhibition of negative emotion

V the artificial pancreas is a technology in development to help people with diabetes automatically control their blood glucose level by providing the substitute endocrine functionality of a healthy pancreas there are several important exocrine digestive and endocrine hormonal functions of the pancreas but it is the lack of insulin production which is the motivation to develop a substitute while the current state of insulin replacement therapy is appreciated for its lifesaving capability the task of manually managing the blood sugar level with insulin alone is arduous and inadequate the goal of the artificial pancreas is twofold different approaches under consideration include   a biological approach to the artificial pancreas is to implant bioengineered tissue containing islet cells which would secrete the amount of insulin amylin and glucagon needed in response to sensed glucose when islet cells have been transplanted via the edmonton protocol insulin production and glycemic control was restored at the expense of immunosuppression encapsulation of the islet cells in a protective coating has been developed to block the immune response to transplanted cells which relieves the burden of immunosuppression and benefits the longevity of the transplant  one concept of the bioartificial pancreas uses encapsulated islet cells to build an islet sheet which can be surgically implanted to function as an artificial pancreas  this islet sheet design consists of islet sheet research is pressing forward with large animal studies at the present with plans for human clinical trials within a few years technology for gene therapy is advancing rapidly such that there are multiple pathways possible to support endocrine function with potential to practically cure diabetes  technology for continuous blood glucose monitoring supports the mission of the artificial pancreas by these capabilities suggest that a stream of realtime data can be used to close the loop and control the insulin pump directly some issues with the present performance of continuous sensing technology suggest that additional study is needed for application to the artificial pancreas as the state of the art for blood glucose monitoring continues to advance so does the promise of the artificial pancreas the first step in controlling an insulin pump based on continuous blood glucose data is to automatically control the basal rate of the insulin pump when a bolus has not recently been performed the pump can manage the blood glucose level by adjusting the basal rate as needed when controlling the basal rate alone the closed loop can still correct a meal bolus error that was too large or small for the food consumed by in france a human clinical trial of an artificial pancreas is underway the system is fully automated by combining medtronic minimeds longterm glucose sensor and its implantable insulin pump  a summary of the project shows promise as well as some present limitations when pramlintide brand name symlin or synthetic amylin is used in combination with insulin the benefits for postprandial glycemic control are substantial  pramlintide is a relatively new treatment for diabetes the treatment involves pramlintide can be infused using an insulin pump at the present time the mixing of pramlintide and insulin in the same cartridge is not an approved practice so two infusion pumps are used simultaneously since insulin and amylin are cosecreted by the pancreatic beta cells in response to raising blood glucose levels using pramlintide and insulin together more closely duplicates the function of the pancreas symlin has potential to support the artificial pancreas project because the ability of the electronic controls of the infusion pump particularly in the bolus shaping capability suggests that the control algorithm may replicate the function of the healthy pancreas in a more copycat fashion at present the insulin bolus is a predictive dose based on what is about to be eaten and then infused completely even with the benefit of the closedloop control of the basal insulin the standard bolus is still a guess and then fix it later approach compare to the pancreatic physiology where insulin and amylin are released from the beta cells in pulses almost directly to the liver in response to the immediate blood glucose level the natural release from the beta cells is a closed loop response to sensed glucose and the shape of the insulin delivery is adaptable and appropriate to the food eaten and the bodys present metabolic capability as technology for continuous blood glucose monitoring improves the integrated components will support a typical application of control theory by employing the proportional integral and derivative control algorithm  this will make it feasible to infuse an adaptive bolus that changes its shape and integral dose based on the measured performance of the bolus in progress depending on the adaptive bolus could start with an assumption of a typical proportions and a bolus shape like the combination bolus this could include the benefits of an automatic bolus delivery might include the purpose of glucagon is to raise blood sugar primarily by promoting release of stored glucose in the liver human glucagon has been synthesized by recombinant dna technology and is available in a dry powder form in the glucagon rescue kit glucagon injection pens are also sometimes provided to diabetics in the uk along with insulin this is useful for rescue of unconscious diabetics from a severe state of hypoglycemia  in healthy pancreatic function glucagon production is initially suppressed by beta cell production of insulin and amylin when blood sugar is high and then is later produced by low or falling blood sugar the natural pancreatic function uses glucagon at the end of an insulin cycle to release glucose from the liver with two advantages if an artificial pancreas were to simulate the natural endocrine pancreas to the maximum extent then insulin and amylin would be used at the beginning of an insulin cycle and glucagon would be used at the end of the insulin cycle research with diabetic pigs given insulinglucagon combination via separate subcutaneous infusion pumps demonstrated closed loop control without incidence of hypoglycemia  while the copycat endocrine function including glucagon seems desirable the benefits relative to the cost and complexity of an artificial pancreas without glucagon are not yet known in the united states in 2006 jdrf formerly the juvenile diabetes research foundation launched a multiyear initiative to help accelerate the availability of an artificial pancreas to people with diabetes  the overall goal of the artificial pancreas project is to accelerate the development regulatory approval and acceptance of continuous glucose monitoring and artificial pancreas technology in the shortest possible timeframe the longterm goal is for broad patient access and a thriving competitive market for these devices and products jdrfs role in quickening the development and availability of the artificial pancreas consists of funding research in order to look over the outcomes of patients using the artificial pancreas keeping close contact with the food and drug administration so that the standards of the patient are met advocating for health care coverage of technologies such as the artificial pancreas and working to ensure clinical acceptance of technologies such as the artificial pancreas in 2011 jdrf strongly urged the fda before congress and in a petition to issue clear and reasonable guidance for an artificial pancreas by december 2011 united kingdom charity diabetes uk funded research projects aimed at further developing and testing an artificial pancreas device on adult patients with type 1 diabetes in 2010 the european commission funded aphome project started to develop an artificial pancreas ap for at home use this should allow patients with diabetes to live close to normal life one aim of the project is focussed on developing and testing an ap system which uses an offtheshelf continuous glucose monitoring cgm system and insulin pump in parallel a novel approach was developed which allows to monitor glucose and infuse insulin via the same port the aphome project has recently come to an end and results of a 12week unsupervised freeliving closedloop clinical study have been published in the new england jounal of medicine  several companies are working on clinical acceptance including medtronic diabetes minimed johnson  johnson animas and insulet these companies have semiautomated closedloop systems that check the glucose level using a cgmcontinuous glucose monitor ask the user to confirm the reading with a blood glucose meter and finally suggest amounts of insulin delivery some companies are also involved in potentially adding a glucagon pump to these systems in an effort to avoid hypoglycemia one such company called pancreum  has recently won an award for its artificial pancreas design  grassroots efforts to create and commercialize a fully automated artificial pancreas system have also arisen directly from patient advocates and the diabetes community  bigfoot biomedical a company founded by parents of children with t1d have created algorithms and are developing a closed loop device that monitor blood sugar and appropriately provide insulin  researchers at imperial college london are working on a bioinspired artificial pancreas biap the device is worn externally and combines a continuous glucose monitor that reads the users interstitial fluid sugar level with an insulin pump that infuses the insulin into the body a biologicallyinspired microchip which uses an algorithm to combine the two is enabling the research team to replicate the activity of the beta cells of the pancreas using integrated circuits on a silicon microchip with this they have been able to deliver insulin profiles expected in a healthy pancreas  in 2014 researchers at harvard university announced that they had discovered how to make huge quantities of insulinproducing pancreatic beta cells from human embryonic stem cells they hoped that these cells would in future transplanted into diabetes patients eliminating the need for manufactured insulin  the pancreas produces three hormones that are important to glycemic control upon digestion of carbohydrates glucose levels in the blood will begin to rise as the blood and glucose flow into the pancreas insulin and amylin are cosecreted by the pancreatic beta cells directly into the bloodstream in response to elevated blood glucose levels in the presence of glucose these insulin responses are almost exclusively delivered in boluses every 4 to 6 minutes insulin causes blood glucose to be removed from the bloodstream and stored in the liver and muscle cells as the blood sugar goes higher additional insulin will bring the blood sugar back down in a classic negative feedback loop as insulin is released from the beta cells amylin is also released into the bloodstream amylin slows gastric emptying and also inhibits the release of glucagon from the pancreatic alpha cells the effect of amylin is to spread out the blood glucose peak after eating reducing the quantity of insulin needed as the blood sugar level comes back toward normal the beta cells will stop spurting insulin and amylin as the glucose level approaches a low mark the pancreatic alpha cells will release glucagon directly into the bloodstream glucagon causes the liver to release stored glucose back into the bloodstream increased glucagon will increase blood glucose levels to produce a positive error in the negative feedback loop together the three endocrine hormones work as a system to maintain the blood glucose level between high and low boundaries by delivering the insulin in boluses as presented by a nondiabetic pancreas the goal of an artificial pancreas can be achieved when the beta cell produces insulin from proinsulin a connecting peptide or cpeptide is also manufactured and released into the bloodstream absence of cpeptide in the blood indicates that insulin has not been released from the pancreas and this fact confirms the diagnosis of diabetes type 1 cpeptide was believed to be only a byproduct of natural insulin production however recent studies suggest that cpeptide exerts beneficial therapeutic effects on diabetic nociceptive neuropathy  ideally to replicate the natural function of the pancreas as closely as possible an artificial pancreas might someday replace all of the beneficial endocrine functions lost including the delivery of insulin amylin glucagon and cpeptide in insulindependent persons blood glucose levels have been roughly controlled using insulin alone the number of grams of carbohydrate is estimated by measuring foods and the measurement is used to determine the amount of insulin necessary to cover the meal the calculation is based on a simple openloop model an insulin to carbohydrate ratio adjusted based on past success is multiplied by the grams of carbohydrate to calculate the units of insulin needed that quantity of insulin is then adjusted based on a premeal blood glucose measurement insulin bolus increased for a high blood sugar or insulin bolus delayed and reduced for a low blood sugar insulin is injected or infused under the skin and enters the bloodstream in approximately 15 minutes after the insulin has acted in the bloodstream the blood glucose level can be tested again and then adjusted with injection of more insulin or eating more carbohydrates until balance is restored assuming the design requirement is to truly mimic normal pancreatic delivery of insulin to the liver in order to achieve proper hepatic stimulation and to cause normal insulin induced functions until another system is available to deliver portal vein concentrations of insulin an intravenous infusion device will be needed there are notable differences with insulin replacement compared to the function of pancreatic insulin delivery an insulin pump to infuse a rapidacting insulin is the first step in simulating the function of the pancreas the pump can accurately deliver small increments of insulin compared to an injection and its electronic controls permit shaping a bolus over time to match the insulin profile required for a given situation the insulin pump is controlled by the pump user to bolus manually based on a recent blood glucose measurement and an estimate of the grams of carbohydrate consumed this predictive approach is said to be openloop once a bolus has been calculated and delivered the pump continues to deliver its basal rate insulin in the manner that has been programmed into the pump controls based on the predicted insulin requirements of its user while insulin replacement is appreciated as a life saving therapy its practical use in controlling blood glucose levels sufficiently to avoid the longterm complications associated with hyperglycemia is not ideal also it is generally agreed that even with very tight glucose control there are a significant number of patients who go on to develop all of the life impacting complications of diabetes thus the goal of the artificial pancreas should be to normalize carbohydrate and lipid metabolism at a minimum

V the ovary from latin ovarium literally egg or nut is an ovumproducing reproductive organ often found in pairs in the female as part of the vertebrate female reproductive system birds have only one functional ovary left while the other remains vestigial ovaries in female are analogous to testes in male in that they are both gonads and endocrine glands although ovaries occur in a wide variety of animals both vertebrate and invertebrate this article is primarily about human ovaries   in the case of human ovaries each one is whitish in color and located alongside the lateral wall of the uterus in a region called the ovarian fossa the fossa usually lies beneath the external iliac artery and in front of the ureter and the internal iliac artery it is about 4cm x 3cm x 2cm in size  usually ovulation occurs in one of the two ovaries at random releasing a fertilizable egg each menstrual cycle however if there was a case where one ovary was absent or dysfunctional then the other ovary would continue providing eggs to be released without any changes in cycle length or frequency in humans the paired ovaries lie within the pelvic cavity on either side of the uterus to which they are attached via a fibrous cord called the ovarian ligament the ovaries are uncovered in the peritoneal cavity but are tethered to the body wall via the suspensory ligament of the ovary the part of the broad ligament of the uterus that covers the ovary is known as the mesovarium the ovary is thus considered an intraperitoneal organ there are two extremities to the ovary the ovary also contains blood vessels and lymphatics  the ovaries are the site of production and periodical release of egg cells the female gametes in the ovaries the developing egg cell or oocyte grows within the environment provided by follicles follicles are composed of different types and number of cells according to the stage of their maturation and their size is indicative of the stage of oocyte development   when the oocyte finishes its maturation in the ovary a surge of luteinizing hormone secreted by the pituitary gland stimulates the release of the oocyte through the rupture of the follicle a process called ovulation  the follicle remains functional and reorganizes into a corpus luteum which secretes progesterone in order to prepare the uterus for an eventual implantation of the embryo   ovaries secrete estrogen testosterone   and progesterone in women fifty percent of testosterone is produced by the ovaries and adrenal glands and released directly into the blood stream  estrogen is responsible for the appearance of secondary sex characteristics for females at puberty and for the maturation and maintenance of the reproductive organs in their mature functional state progesterone prepares the uterus for pregnancy and the mammary glands for lactation progesterone functions with estrogen by promoting menstrual cycle changes in the endometrium as women age they experience a decline in reproductive performance leading to menopause this decline is tied to a decline in the number of ovarian follicles although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary only about 500 about 005 of these ovulate and the rest are wasted the decline in ovarian reserve appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age  and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age 52 as ovarian reserve and fertility decline with age there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and meiotic errors resulting in chromosomally abnormal conceptions women with an inherited mutation in the dna repair gene brca1 undergo menopause prematurely  suggesting that naturally occurring dna damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in these women and this inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure the brca1 protein plays a key role in a type of dna repair termed homologous recombinational repair that is the only known cellular process that can accurately repair dna doublestrand breaks titus et al  showed that dna doublestrand breaks accumulate with age in humans and mice in primordial follicles primodial follicles contain oocytes that are at an intermediate prophase i stage of meiosis meiosis is the general process in eukaryotic organisms by which germ cells are formed and it is likely an adaptation for removing dna damages especially doublestrand breaks from germ line dna  see meiosis and origin and function of meiosis homologous recombinational repair is especially promoted during meiosis titus et al  also found that expression of 4 key genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair of dna doublestrand breaks brca1 mre11 rad51 and atm decline with age in the oocytes of humans and mice they hypothesized that dna doublestrand break repair is vital for the maintenance of oocyte reserve and that a decline in efficiency of repair with age plays a key role in ovarian aging ovarian diseases can be classified as endocrine disorders or as a disorders of the reproductive system if the egg fails to release from the follicle in the ovary an ovarian cyst may form small ovarian cysts are common in healthy women some women have more follicles than usual polycystic ovary syndrome which inhibits the follicles to grow normally and this will cause cycle irregularities other conditions include cryopreservation of ovarian tissue often called ovarian tissue cryopreservation is of interest to women who want to preserve their reproductive function beyond the natural limit or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer therapy  for example in hematologic malignancies or breast cancer  the procedure is to take a part of the ovary and carry out slow freezing before storing it in liquid nitrogen whilst therapy is undertaken tissue can then be thawed and implanted near the fallopian either orthotopic on the natural location or heterotopic on the abdominal wall  where it starts to produce new eggs allowing normal conception to take place  a study of 60 procedures concluded that ovarian tissue harvesting appears to be safe  the ovarian tissue may also be transplanted into mice that are immunocompromised scid mice to avoid graft rejection and tissue can be harvested later when mature follicles have developed  ovaries of some kind are found in the female reproductive system of many animals that employ sexual reproduction including invertebrates however they develop in a very different way in most invertebrates than they do in vertebrates and are not truly homologous  many of the features found in human ovaries are common to all vertebrates including the presence of follicular cells tunica albuginea and so on however many species produce a far greater number of eggs during their lifetime than do humans so that in fish and amphibians there may be hundreds or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary at any given time in these species fresh eggs may be developing from the germinal epithelium throughout life corpora lutea are found only in mammals and in some elasmobranch fish in other species the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary in birds reptiles and monotremes the egg is relatively large filling the follicle and distorting the shape of the ovary at maturity  amphibians and reptiles have no ovarian medulla the central part of the ovary is a hollow lymphfilled space the ovary of teleosts is also often hollow but in this case the eggs are shed into the cavity which opens into the oviduct  certain nematodes of the genus philometra are parasitic in the ovary of marine fishes and can be spectacular with females as long as 40cm coiled in the ovary of a fish half this length  these nematodes never parasitize humans although most normal female vertebrates have two ovaries this is not the case in all species in most birds and in platypuses the right ovary never matures so that only the left is functional exceptions include the kiwi and some but not all raptors in which both ovaries persist   in some elasmobranchs only the right ovary develops fully in the primitive jawless fish and some teleosts there is only one ovary formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo  left ovary ovaries uterus

V an artificial lung al is a prosthetic device that provides oxygenation of blood and removal of carbon dioxide from blood the al is intended to take over some of the functionality of biological lungs it is different from a heartlung machine in that it is internal and designed to take over the functions of the lungs for long periods of time rather than on a temporary basis the heart lung machine inspired the design of al devices however modern als are optimized to minimize patient trauma following the development of the heart lung machine extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo was developed this was intended to be used as a bridge to lung transplant btt for patients too sick to wait until a donor lung was available mechanical ventilation mv has also been used however is damaging to the patients lungs if used for extended periods of time both these therapies are expensive and are associated with poor quality of life in part due to patient immobility and the complex blood circuit recent developments include simplifying the ecmo system and devices that use 380 micron wide hollow fibers to simulate the function of alveoli have been developed several research groups notably the university of pittsburgh  university of michigan university of maryland and boston based groups are developing al devices to bridge patients to lung transplant

V the lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails in mammals and most other vertebrates two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere in a process of gas exchange respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species mammals reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing in early tetrapods air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping a mechanism still seen in amphibians in humans the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm humans have two lungs a right lung and a left lung they are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest the right lung is bigger than the left lung as the left lung shares space in the chest with the heart the lungs together weigh approximately 13 kilograms 29lb with the right lung weighing more than the left the lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone these divide until air reaches microscopic alveoli which is where the process of gas exchange takes place together the lungs contain approximately 2400 kilometres 1500mi of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli the lungs are enclosed within a sac called the pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place without much friction this sac encloses each lung and also divides each lung into sections called lobes the right lung has three lobes whilst the left lung only has two the lobes are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments and lobules the lungs have a unique blood supply receiving deoxygenated blood sent from the heart for the purposes of receiving oxygen the pulmonary circulation and a separate blood supply of oxygenated blood the bronchial circulation the tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of diseases including pneumonia and lung cancer chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema can be related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances diseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract in embryonic development the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the foregut a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the digestive system when the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluidfilled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus at birth however air begins to pass through the lungs and the diversionary duct closes so that the lungs can begin to respire the lungs only fully develop in early childhood medical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo from the latin pulmonarius of the lungs as in pulmonology or with pneumo from greek \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd lung as in pneumonia   the lungs are located in the chest on either side of the heart in the rib cage they are conical in shape with a narrow rounded apex at the top and a broad base that rests on the diaphragm the apex of the lung extends into the root of the neck reaching shortly above the level of the sternal end of the first rib the lungs stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm  the left lung shares space with the heart with an angular notch in its anterior border called the cardiac notch each lung has a costal surface which is adjacent to the ribcage a diaphragmatic surface which faces downward toward the diaphragm and a mediastinal surface which faces toward the centre of the chest and lies against the heart great vessels and the carina where the two main bronchi branch off from the base of the trachea on the mediastinal surface of each lung there is a concavity called the cardiac impression at the level of the heart the cardiac impression on the left lung is wider and deeper than that of the right lung because of this and the cardiac notch the right lung is larger in volume total capacity and weight despite being about 5cm shorter in height than the left both lungs have a central recession called the hilum at the root of the lung where the blood vessels and airways pass into the lungs  there are also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum the costal surface along the rib cage is smooth and convex with slight grooves corresponding to indentations by the ribs the lungs are surrounded by the pulmonary pleurae the pleurae are two serous membranes the outer parietal pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly lines the surface of the lungs between the pleurae is a potential space called the pleural cavity containing pleural fluid each lung is divided into lobes by the invaginations of the pleura as fissures the fissures are double folds of pleura that section the lungs these sections help in the expansion of the lungs  the lobes of the lungs are further divided into bronchopulmonary segments based on the locations of bronchioles segments for the left and right lung are shown in the table  the segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localizing disease processes in the lungs  lower lingula the right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left it is divided into three lobes an upper middle and a lower by two fissures one oblique and one horizontal the upper horizontal fissure separates the upper from the middle lobe it begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of the lung and running horizontally forward cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the hilum  the lower oblique fissure separates the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique fissure in the left lung   the mediastinal surface of the right lung is indented by a number of nearby structures the heart sits in an impression called the cardiac impression above the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for the azygos vein and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right innominate vein behind this and close to the top of the lung is a groove for the innominate artery there is a groove for the esophagus behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament and near the lower part of the esophageal groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart  the left lung is divided into two lobes an upper and a lower by the oblique fissure which extends from the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum  the left lung unlike the right does not have middle lobe though it does have a homologous feature a projection of the upper lobe termed the lingula its name means little tongue the lingula on the left serves as an anatomic parallel to the right middle lobe with both areas being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications   there are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula superior and inferior  the mediastinal surface of the left lung has a large cardiac impression where the heart sits this is deeper and larger than that on the right lung at which level the heart projects to the left   on the same surface immediately above the hilum is a wellmarked curved groove for the aortic arch and a groove below it for the descending aorta the left subclavian artery a branch off the aortic arch sits in a groove from the arch to near the apex of the lung a shallower groove in front of the artery and near the edge of the lung lodges the left innominate vein the esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression at the base of the lung  the lung is part of the respiratory system and contains the majority of the lower respiratory tract after the trachea  the trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits the carina into a right and left bronchus these supply air to the right and left lungs splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles these in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli where the exchange of gases take place  oxygen diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries small blood vessels  estimates of the total surface area of lungs vary from 5075 square metres   roughly the same area as one side of a tennis court   the bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order to hold open the airways the bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded instead by smooth muscle  air is warmed to 37c 99f humidified and cleansed by the conduction zone particles from the air being removed by the cilia on the respiratory epithelium lining the passageways the human lung has a dual blood supply  the tissue of the lungs receive oxygenated blood via the bronchial circulation a series of arteries that leave the aorta and are part of the systemic circulation there are usually three arteries and they branch alongside the bronchi and bronchioles  the lungs also receive deoxygenated blood from the heart and supply it with oxygen in a process known as respiration in this process venous blood in the body collects in the right atrium and is pumped from the right ventricle through the pulmonary trunk and the pulmonary arteries into the left and right lungs blood passes through small capillaries next to the alveoli in the lung receives oxygen and travels back to the heart this is called the pulmonary circulation the oxygenated blood is then pumped to the rest of the body   the lungs receive innervation via the lung consists of the tissues that line the respiratory tract the tissue in between called interstitium or parenchyma and the tissue that lines the duct the respiratory tract begins with the trachea and bronchi these structures are lined with columnar epithelial cells that possess cilia small frondlike projections interspersed with the epithelial cells are goblet cells which produce mucous and club cells with actions similar to macrophages surrounding these in the trachea and bronchi are cartilage rings which help to maintain stability   bronchioles possess the same columnar epithelial lining but are not surrounded by cartilage rings instead they are encircled by a layer of smooth muscle   the respiratory tract ends in lobules these consist of a respiratory bronchiole which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs which in turn divide into alveoli  alveoli consist of two types of alveolar cell and an alveolar macrophage the two types of cell are known as type i and type ii alveolar cells  also known as pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages  types i and ii make up the walls and septa of the alveoli type i cells provide 95 of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat squamous and type ii cells generally cluster in the corners of the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape  despite this cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 11 or 6040    the macrophages are attached to the alveoli the alveolar macrophages have an important immunological role they remove substances which deposit in the alveoli including loose red blood cells that have been forced out from blood vesels   the lung is surrounded by a serous membrane of visceral pleura which has underneath it a layer of loose connective tissue and beneath this is the substance of the lung  the development of the human lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over several weeks inside the foetus and for several months following birth  the larynx trachea bronchi and lungs begin to form during the fourth week of embryogenesis  at this time the lung bud appears ventrally to the caudal portion of the foregut the location of the lung bud along the gut tube is directed by various signals from the surrounding mesenchyme including fibroblast growth factors at the same time as the lung bud grows the future trachea separates from the foregut through the formation of tracheoesophageal ridges which fuse to form the tracheoesophageal septum the lung bud divides into two the right and left primary bronchial buds  during the fifth week the right bud branches into three secondary bronchial buds and the left branches into two secondary bronchial buds these give rise to the lobes of the lungs three on the right and two on the left over the following week the secondary buds branch into tertiary buds about ten on each side  from the sixth week to the sixteenth week the major elements of the lungs appear except the alveoli  from week 16 to week 26 the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes highly vascularised bronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop during the period covering the 26th week until birth the important bloodair barrier is established specialised type i alveolar cells where gas exchange will take place together with the type ii alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactant appear the surfactant reduces the surface tension at the airalveolar surface which allows expansion of the terminal saccules these saccules form at the end of the bronchioles and their appearance marks the point at which limited respiration would be possible  at birth the babys lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated when the newborn is expelled from the birth canal its central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment this triggers it to take the first breath within about 10 seconds after delivery  the newborn lung is far from being a miniaturized version of the adult lung it has only about 20000000 to 50000000 alveoli or 6 to 15 percent of the full adult complement although it was previously thought that alveolar formation could continue to the age of eight years and beyond it is now accepted that the bulk of alveolar formation is concluded much earlier probably before the age of two years the newly formed inter alveolar septa still contain a double capillary network instead of the single one of the adult lungs this means that the pulmonary capillary bed must be completely reorganized during and after alveolar formation it has to mature only after full microvascular maturation which is terminated sometime between the ages of two and five years is the lung development completed and the lung can enter a phase of normal growth  the lungs of mammals including those of humans have a soft spongelike texture and are honeycombed with epithelium having a much larger surface area in total than the outer surface area of the lung itself breathing is largely driven by the muscular diaphragm at the bottom of the thorax contraction of the diaphragm pulls the bottom of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed downward increasing volume and thus decreasing pressure causing air to flow into the airways air enters through the oral and nasal cavities it flows through the pharynx then the larynx and into the trachea which branches out into the main bronchi and then subsequent divisions during normal breathing exhalation is passive and no muscles are contracted the diaphragm relaxes the rib cage itself is also able to expand and contract to some degree through the use of the intercostal muscles together with the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles as a result air is transported into or expelled out of the lungs this type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmiths bellows  thermoregulation via panting is seen in some animals but not humans the respiratory systems alveoli are the sites of gas exchange with blood  in humans the trachea divides into the two main bronchi that enter the roots of the lungs the bronchi continue to divide within the lung and after multiple divisions give rise to bronchioles the bronchial tree continues branching until it reaches the level of terminal bronchioles which lead to respiratory bronchioles and alveolar sacs alveolar sacs are made up of clusters of alveoli like individual grapes within a bunch the individual alveoli are tightly wrapped in capillaries and it is here that gas exchange actually occurs deoxygenated blood from the heart is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where oxygen diffuses into blood and is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the hemoglobin of the erythrocytes the oxygenrich blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins to be pumped back into systemic circulation   there is also a relationship noted between the pressures in the lung in the alveoli in the arteries and in the veins this is conceptualised into the lung being divided into three vertical regions called the zones of the lung  the lungs possess several characteristics which protect against infection in addition to their function in respiration the lungs also human lungs can be affected by a variety of diseases pulmonology is the medical speciality that deals with diseases involving the respiratory tract  and cardiothoracic surgery is the surgical field that deals with surgery of the lungs infections of the lung tissue are called pneumonia of the respiratory tract are called bronchitis or bronchiolitis and of the tissues surrounding the lungs pleurisy many infections are due to bacteria or viruses however not all causes of pneumonia or bronchial tree inflammation are caused by infection one important cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis   chronic infections often occur in those with immunosuppression and may include fungi such as aspergillus   a pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries the majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilationperfusion scan a ct scan of the arteries of the lung or blood tests such as the ddimer   pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure at the beginning of the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes   other rare conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys   the function of the lungs can also be impacted by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural effusion or other substances such as air pneumothorax blood hemothorax or rarer causes these may be investigated using a chest xray or ct scan and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause is identified and treated   asthma chronic bronchitis bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction this limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree due to inflammation obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers such as dust mites or smoking with symptom control such as bronchodilators and with suppression of inflammation such as through corticosteroids in severe cases one common cause of copd and emphysema is smoking and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis the definitive cause of asthma is not yet known   some types of chronic lung diseases are classified as restrictive lung disease because of a restriction in the amount of lung tissue involved in respiration these include pulmonary fibrosis can occur when the lung is inflamed for a long period of time fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue this can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as coalworkers pneumoconiosis autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication    lung cancer can can either arise directly from lung tissue or as a result of metastasis from another part of the body there are two main types of primary tumor described as either smallcell or nonsmallcell lung carcinomas the major risk factor for cancer is smoking once a cancer is identified it is staged using scans such as a ct scan and a sample of tissue a biopsy is taken cancers may be treated by surgically removing the tumour radiotherapy chemotherapy or combinations thereof or with the aim of symptom control    congenital disorders include cystic fibrosis pulmonary hypoplasia an incomplete development of the lungs  and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant an azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures  lung function testing is carried out by evaluating a persons capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances the inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively the summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a persons vital capacity not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out the remainder of the air is called the residual volume together these terms are referred to as lung volumes  pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure functional residual capacity the total lung capacity depends on the persons age height weight and sex and normally ranges between 4000 and 6000cm  4 to 6 l females tend to have a 2025 lower capacity than males tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers lung capacity is also affected by altitude people who are born and live at sea level will have a smaller lung capacity than people who spend their lives at a high altitude in addition to the total lung capacity the tidal volume is also measured this is the volume breathed in with an average breath which is about 500cm   other lung function tests include spirometry measuring the amount volume and flow of air that can be inhaled and exhaled the maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled is called the vital capacity these tests can help to determine whether a disease is restrictive or obstructive   another measure is the respiratory minute volume which is the volume of air which can be inhaled or exhaled from a persons lungs in one minute this is normally registered when a person has a ventilator supporting breathing due to a sickness or injury the lungs of birds are relatively small but are connected to 89 air sacs that extend through much of the body and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones on inspiration air travels through the trachea of a bird into the 89 air sacs air then travels continuously from the air sacs at the back of the bird through the lungs of the bird and to the air sacs at the front of the bird from here air is expelled this type of lung construction is called a circulatory lung as distinct from the bellows lung possessed by other animals  this means that they are able to extract a greater concentration of oxygen from inhaled air birds are thus equipped to fly at altitudes at which mammals would succumb to hypoxia this also allows them to sustain a higher metabolic rate than most equivalent weight mammals  the lungs of birds are honeycomblike and contain millions of tiny passages called parabronchi small sacs called called atria radiate from the walls of the tiny passages and are the site of gas exchange gas exchange occurs by diffusion in these walls as gas travels between the lumen of each parabronchus and blood vessels the air sacs which hold air do not contribute much to gas exchange despite being thinwalled as they are poorly vascularized the air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume in a birds thorax and abdomen this volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronized with movement of the flight muscles  this typical system is one of two types of parabronchi found in birds called paleopulmonic parabronchi and is found in all birds some bird species also have a lung structure where the air flow is bidirectional called neopulmonic parabronchi the lung of most reptiles has a single bronchus running down the centre from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs these pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals but much larger and fewer in number these give the lung a spongelike texture in tuataras snakes and some lizards the lungs are simpler in structure similar to that of typical amphibians  snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung as a major respiratory organ the left lung is greatly reduced or even absent amphisbaenians however have the opposite arrangement with a major left lung and a reduced or absent right lung  both crocodilians and monitor lizards have developed lungs similar to those of birds providing an unidirectional airflow and even possessing air sacs  the now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even further refined this type of lung extending the airsacs into the wing membranes and in the case of pteranodontia the hindlimbs reptilian lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping crocodilians also rely on the hepatic piston method in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone part of the pelvis which in turn pulls the bottom of the lungs backward expanding them turtles which are unable to move their ribs instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in and out of the lungs  the lungs of most frogs and other amphibians are simple and balloonlike with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of the lung this is not very efficient but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping this is distinct from most higher vertebrates who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding the rib cage  in buccal pumping the floor of the mouth is lowered filling the mouth cavity with air the throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull forcing the air into the lungs  due to the possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size all known lungless tetrapods are amphibians the majority of salamander species are lungless salamanders which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their mouth this necessarily restrict their size all are small and rather threadlike in appearance maximizing skin surface relative to body volume  the only other known lungless tetrapods are the bornean flatheaded frog barbourula kalimantanensis and atretochoana eiselti a caecilian the lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls septa of soft tissue around the outer walls increasing the respiratory surface area and giving the lung a honeycomb appearance in some salamanders even these are lacking and the lung has a smooth wall in caecilians as in snakes only the right lung attains any size or development  the lungs of lungfish are similar to those of amphibians with few if any internal septa in the australian lungfish there is only a single lung albeit divided into two lobes other lungfish and polypterus however have two lungs which are located in the upper part of the body with the connecting duct curving round and above the esophagus the blood supply also twists around the esophagus suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body as in other vertebrates  some invertebrates have lungs that serve a similar respiratory purpose as but are not evolutionarily related to vertebrate lungs some arachnids the spiders and the scorpions have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange some species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs the scorpion has spiracles on its body for the entrance of air to the book lungs the coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air  they cannot swim and would drown in water they can breathe on land and hold their breath underwater the branchiostegal lungs are seen as a developmental adaptive stage from waterliving to enable landliving or from fish to amphibianthe crabs also have a rudimentary set of gills pulmonates are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle cavity an externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to be taken into the mantle cavity lung the lungs of todays terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of todays fish are believed to have evolved from simple sacs as outpocketings of the esophagus that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygenpoor conditions  these outpocketings first arose in the bony fish in most of the rayfinned fish the sacs evolved into closed off gas bladders while a number of carps trouts herrings catfish eels have retained the physostome condition with the sack being open to the esophagus in more basal bony fish such as the gar bichir bowfin and the lobefinned fish the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs  the lobefinned fish gave rise to the landbased tetrapods thus the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish but not to their gills this is reflected by the fact that the lungs of a fetus also develop from an outpocketing of the esophagus and in the case of the physostome gas bladders which can serve as both buoyancy organ and with the pneumatic duct to the gut also serve as lungs this condition is found in more primitive teleosts and is lost in the higher orders this is an instance of correlation between ontogeny and phylogeny no known animals have both a gas bladder and lungs diagram of the respiratory system anatomy of lungs front view of heart and lungs transverse

V an artificial heart is a device that replaces the heart artificial hearts are typically used to bridge the time to heart transplantation or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible although other similar inventions preceded it going back to the late 1940s the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the jarvik7 in 1982 designed by a team including willem johan kolff and robert jarvik an artificial heart is distinct from a ventricular assist device designed to support a failing heart it is also distinct from a cardiopulmonary bypass machine which is an external device used to provide the functions of both the heart and lungs and are only used for a few hours at a time most commonly during cardiac surgery   a synthetic replacement for the heart remains one of the longsought holy grails of modern medicine the obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for heart transplants because the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply although the heart is conceptually a pump it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies consequences of these issues include severe foreignbody rejection and external batteries that limit mobility these complications limited the lifespan of early human recipients to hours or days the first artificial heart was made by vladimir demikhov in 1937 it was transplanted to a dog although jarvik created the idea and rough draft for the artificial heart his models were not created of a material that the human body would accept dayton ohios ival o salyer along with various colleagues developed a polymer material that the human body would not necessarily reject on july 3 1952 41yearold henry opitek suffering from shortness of breath made medical history at harper university hospital at wayne state university in michigan the dodrillgmr heart machine considered to be the first operational mechanical heart was successfully used while performing heart surgery   forest dewey dodrill working closely with matthew dudley used the machine in 1952 to bypass henry opiteks left ventricle for 50 minutes while he opened the patients left atrium and worked to repair the mitral valve in dodrills postoperative report he notes to our knowledge this is the first instance of survival of a patient when a mechanical heart mechanism was used to take over the complete body function of maintaining the blood supply of the body while the heart was open and operated on  a heartlung machine was first used in 1953 during a successful open heart surgery john heysham gibbon the inventor of the machine performed the operation and developed the heartlung substitute himself following these advances scientific interest for the development of a solution for heart disease developed in numerous research groups worldwide in 1949 a precursor to the modern artificial heart pump was built by doctors william sewell and william glenn of the yale school of medicine using an erector set assorted odds and ends and dimestore toys the external pump successfully bypassed the heart of a dog for more than an hour  paul winchell invented an artificial heart with the assistance of henry heimlich the inventor of the heimlich maneuver and held the first patent for such a device the university of utah developed a similar apparatus around the same time but when they tried to patent it winchells heart was cited as prior art the university requested that winchell donate the heart to the university of utah which he did there is some debate as to how much of winchells design robert jarvik used in creating jarviks artificial heart heimlich states i saw the heart i saw the patent and i saw the letters the basic principle used in winchells heart and jarviks heart is exactly the same jarvik denies that any of winchells design elements were incorporated into the device he fabricated for humans which was successfully implanted into barney clark in 1982 on december 12 1957 willem johan kolff the worlds most prolific inventor of artificial organs implanted an artificial heart into a dog at cleveland clinic the dog lived for 90 minutes in 1958 domingo liotta initiated the studies of tah replacement at lyon france and in 195960 at the national university of córdoba argentina he presented his work at the meeting of the american society for artificial internal organs held in atlantic city in march 1961 at that meeting liotta described the implantation of three types of orthotopic inside the pericardial sac tahs in dogs each of which used a different source of external energy an implantable electric motor an implantable rotating pump with an external electric motor and a pneumatic pump   in 1964 the national institutes of health started the artificial heart program with the goal of putting a manmade heart into a human by the end of the decade  in february 1966 adrian kantrowitz rose to international prominence when he performed the worlds first permanent implantation of a partial mechanical heart left ventricular assist device at maimonides medical center  in 1967 kolff left cleveland clinic to start the division of artificial organs at the university of utah and pursue his work on the artificial heart over the years more than 200 physicians engineers students and faculty developed tested and improved kolffs artificial heart to help manage his many endeavors kolff assigned project managers each project was named after its manager graduate student robert jarvik was the project manager for the artificial heart which was subsequently renamed the jarvik 7 in 1981 william devries submitted a request to the fda for permission to implant the jarvik 7 into a human being on december 2 1982 kolff implanted the jarvik 7 artificial heart into barney clark a dentist from seattle who was suffering from severe congestive heart failure clark lived for 112 days tethered to an external pneumatic compressor a device weighing some 400 pounds 180kg but during that time he suffered prolonged periods of confusion and a number of instances of bleeding and asked several times to be allowed to die  on april 4 1969 domingo liotta and denton a cooley replaced a dying mans heart with a mechanical heart inside the chest at the texas heart institute in houston as a bridge for a transplant the man woke up and began to recover after 64 hours the pneumaticpowered artificial heart was removed and replaced by a donor heart however thirtytwo hours after transplantation the man died of what was later proved to be an acute pulmonary infection extended to both lungs caused by fungi most likely caused by an immunosuppressive drug complication  the original prototype of liottacooley artificial heart used in this historic operation is prominently displayed in the smithsonian institutions national museum of american history treasures of american history exhibit in washington dc  the first clinical use of an artificial heart designed for permanent implantation rather than a bridge to transplant occurred in 1982 at the university of utah artificial kidney pioneer willem johan kolff started the utah artificial organs program in 1967  there physicianengineer clifford kwangett invented two components of an integrated pneumatic artificial heart system a ventricle with hemispherical diaphragms that did not crush red blood cells a problem with previous artificial hearts and an external heart driver that inherently regulated blood flow without needing complex control systems  independently paul winchell designed and patented a similarly shaped ventricle and donated the patent to the utah program  throughout the 1970s and early 1980s veterinarian donald olsen led a series of calf experiments that refined the artificial heart and its surgical care during that time as a student at the university of utah robert jarvik combined several modifications an ovoid shape to fit inside the human chest a more bloodcompatible polyurethane developed by biomedical engineer donald lyman and a fabrication method by kwangett that made the inside of the ventricles smooth and seamless to reduce dangerous strokecausing blood clots  on december 2 1982 william devries implanted the artificial heart into retired dentist barney bailey clark born january 21 1921 who survived 112 days with the device dying on march 23 1983 bill schroeder became the second recipient and lived for a record 620 days contrary to popular belief and erroneous articles in several periodicals the jarvik heart was not banned for permanent use today the modern version of the jarvik 7 is known as the syncardia temporary total artificial heart it has been implanted in more than 1350 people as a bridge to transplantation in the mid1980s artificial hearts were powered by dishwashersized pneumatic power sources whose lineage went back to alfa laval milking machines moreover two sizable catheters had to cross the body wall to carry the pneumatic pulses to the implanted heart greatly increasing the risk of infection to speed development of a new generation of technologies the national heart lung and blood institute opened a competition for implantable electrically powered artificial hearts three groups received funding cleveland clinic in cleveland ohio the college of medicine of pennsylvania state university penn state hershey medical center in hershey pennsylvania and abiomed inc of danvers massachusetts despite considerable progress the cleveland program was discontinued after the first five years polymeric trileaflet valves ensure unidirectional blood flow with a low pressure gradient and good longevity stateoftheart transcutaneous energy transfer eliminates the need for electric wires crossing the chest wall on july 19 1963 e stanley crawford and domingo liotta implanted the first clinical left ventricular assist device lvad at the methodist hospital in houston texas in a patient who had a cardiac arrest after surgery the patient survived for four days under mechanical support but did not recover from the complications of the cardiac arrest finally the pump was discontinued and the patient died on april 21 1966 michael debakey and liotta implanted the first clinical lvad in a paracorporeal position where the external pump rests at the side of the patient at the methodist hospital in houston in a patient experiencing cardiogenic shock after heart surgery the patient developed neurological and pulmonary complications and died after few days of lvad mechanical support in october 1966 debakey and liotta implanted the paracorporeal liottadebakey lvad in a new patient who recovered well and was discharged from the hospital after 10 days of mechanical support thus constituting the first successful use of an lvad for postcardiotomy shock in june 1996 a 46yearold man received a total artificial heart implantation done by jeng wei at chenghsin general hospital  in the republic of china taiwan this technologically advanced pneumatic phoenix7 total artificial heart was manufactured by a taiwanese dentist kelvin k cheng a chinese physician t m kao and colleagues at the taiwan tah research center in tainan republic of china taiwan with this experimental artificial heart the patients bp was maintained at 901004055 mmhg and cardiac output at 4258 lmin  the patient then received the worlds first successful combined heart and kidney transplantation after bridging with a total artificial heart  the first abiocor to be surgically implanted in a patient was on july 3 2001  the abiocor is made of titanium and plastic with a weight of two pounds and its internal battery can be recharged with a transduction device that sends power through the skin  the internal battery lasts for a half hour and a wearable external battery pack lasts for four hours  the fda announced on september 5 2006 that the abiocor could be implanted for humanitarian uses after the device had been tested on 15 patients  it is intended for critically ill patients who cannot receive a heart transplant  some limitations of the current abiocor are that its size makes it suitable for only about 50 of the male population and its useful life is only 12 years  by combining its valved ventricles with the control technology and roller screw developed at penn state abiomed has designed a smaller more stable heart the abiocor ii this pump which should be implantable in most men and 50 of women with a life span of up to five years  had animal trials in 2005 and the company hoped to get fda approval for human use in 2008  in august 2006 an artificial heart was implanted into a 15yearold girl at the stollery childrens hospital in edmonton alberta it was intended to act as a temporary fixture until a donor heart could be found instead the artificial heart called a berlin heart allowed for natural processes to occur and her heart healed on its own after 146 days the berlin heart was removed and the girls heart was able to function properly on its own  on december 16 2011 the berlin heart gained us fda approval the device has since been successfully implanted in several children including a 4yearold honduran girl at childrens hospital boston  in 2012 a study published in the new england journal of medicine compared the berlin heart to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo and concluded that a ventricular assist device available in several sizes for use in children as a bridge to heart transplantation such as the berlin heart was associated with a significantly higher rate of survival as compared with ecmo  the studys primary author charles d fraser jr surgeon in chief at texas childrens hospital explained with the berlin heart we have a more effective therapy to offer patients earlier in the management of their heart failure when we sit with parents we have real data to offer so they can make an informed decision this is a giant step forward   another us team has a prototype called the 2005 magscrew total artificial heart teams in japan and south korea are also racing to produce similar devices    in august 2010 70yearold angelo tigano of fairfield new south wales australia had his failing heart removed in a fivehour operation and it was replaced with the syncardia temporary total artificial heart by surgeon dr phillip spratt head of the heart transplant unit at st vincents hospital sydney  on 9 june 2011 40yearold matthew green was implanted with the syncardia temporary total artificial heart in a sevenhour operation at papworth hospital he was the first briton to leave a hospital supported by an artificial heart on 2 august 2011  syncardia is a company based in tucson arizona and currently has two separate models available it is available in a 70cc and 50cc size the 70 cc is used for biventricular heart failure in adult men while the 50cc is for children and women  on 12 march 2011 an experimental artificial heart was implanted in 55yearold craig lewis at the texas heart institute in houston by drs o h frazier and william cohn the device is a combination of two modified heartmate ii pumps that is currently undergoing bovine trials  frazier and cohn are on the board of the bivacor company that develops an artificial heart   bivacor has been tested as a replacement for a heart in a sheep   so far only one person has benefitted from frazier and cohns artificial heart craig lewis was suffering from amyloidosis in 2011 when his heart gave out and doctors pronounced that he had only 12 to 24 hours to live after obtaining permission from his family frazier and cohn replaced his heart with their device lewis survived for another 5 weeks after the operation he later succumbed to liver and kidney failure due to his amyloidosis after which his family asked that his artificial heart be unplugged  on october 27 2008 french professor and leading heart transplant specialist alain f carpentier announced that a fully implantable artificial heart would be ready for clinical trial by 2011 and for alternative transplant in 2013 it was developed and would be manufactured by him biomedical firm carmat sa  and venture capital firm truffle capital the prototype used embedded electronic sensors and was made from chemically treated animal tissues called biomaterials or a pseudoskin of biosynthetic microporous materials  according to a pressrelease by carmat dated december 20 2013 the first implantation of its artificial heart in a 75yearold patient was performed on december 18 2013 by the georges pompidou european hospital team in paris france  the patient died 75 days after the operation  in carmats design two chambers are each divided by a membrane that holds hydraulic fluid on one side a motorized pump moves hydraulic fluid in and out of the chambers and that fluid causes the membrane to move blood flows through the other side of each membrane the bloodfacing side of the membrane is made of tissue obtained from a sac that surrounds a cows heart to make the device more biocompatible the carmat device also uses valves made from cow heart tissue and has sensors to detect increased pressure within the device that information is sent to an internal control system that can adjust the flow rate in response to increased demand such as when a patient is exercising  this distinguishes it from previous designs that maintain a constant flow rate the carmat device unlike previous designs is meant to be used in cases of terminal heart failure instead of being used as a bridge device while the patient awaits a transplant  at 900 grams it weighs nearly three times the typical heart and is targeted primarily towards obese men it also requires the patient to carry around an additional liion battery the projected lifetime of the artificial heart is around 5 years 230 million beats  since 1991 the foundation for cardiac surgery development frk in zabrze has been working on developing an artificial heart nowadays the polish system for heart support polcas consists of the artificial ventricle polvadmev and the three controllers polpdu401 polpdu402 and polpdu501 presented devices are designed to handle only one patient the control units of the 401 and 402 series may be used only in hospital due to its big size method of control and type of power supply the control  unit of 501 series is the latest product of frk due to its much smaller size and weight it is significantly more mobile solution for this reason it can be also used during supervised treatment conducted outside the hospital a centrifugal pump   or an axialflow pump   can be used as an artificial heart resulting in the patient being alive without a pulse a centrifugal artificial heart which alternately pumps the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation causing a pulse has been described  researcher have constructed a heart out of foam the heart is made out of flexible silicone and works with an external pump to push air and fluids through the heart it currently cannot be implanted into humans but it is a promising start for artificial hearts  patients who have some remaining heart function but who can no longer live normally may be candidates for ventricular assist devices vad which do not replace the human heart but complement it by taking up much of the function the first left ventricular assist device lvad system was created by domingo liotta at baylor college of medicine in houston in 1962  another vad the kantrowitz cardiovad designed by adrian kantrowitz boosts the native heart by taking up over 50 of its function  additionally the vad can help patients on the wait list for a heart transplant in a young person this device could delay the need for a transplant by 1015 years or even allow the heart to recover in which case the vad can be removed  the artificial heart is powered by a battery that needs to be changed several times while still working the first heart assist device was approved by the fda in 1994 and two more received approval in 1998  while the original assist devices emulated the pulsating heart newer versions such as the heartmate ii  developed by the texas heart institute of houston provide continuous flow these pumps which may be centrifugal or axial flow are smaller and potentially more durable and last longer than the current generation of total heart replacement pumps another major advantage of a vad is that the patient keeps the natural heart which may still function for temporary backup support if the mechanical pump were to stop this may provide enough support to keep the patient alive until a solution to the problem is implemented several continuousflow ventricular assist devices have been approved for use in the european union and as of august 2007 were undergoing clinical trials for fda approval suffering from endstage heart failure former vice president dick cheney underwent a procedure in july 2010 to have a vad implanted at inova fairfax hospital in fairfax virginia in 2012 he received a heart transplant at age 71 after 20 months on a waiting list

V consciousness after death is a common theme in society and culture in the context of life after death scientific research has established that the mind and normal waking consciousness are closely connected with the physiological functioning of the brain the cessation of which defines brain death however many people believe in some form of life after death which is a feature of many religions   neuroscience is a large interdisciplinary field founded on the premise that all of behavior and all of the cognitive processes that constitute the mind have their origin in the structure and function of the nervous system especially in the brain according to this view the mind can be regarded as a set of operations carried out by the brain      there are multiple lines of evidence that support this view they are here briefly summarized along with some examples death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat cardiac arrest and of breathing but the development of cpr and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted events which were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances without a functioning heart or lungs life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices organ transplants and artificial pacemakers it may also be suggested that it is not possible for oneself or ones consciousness to know understand define or conclude that oneself is already dead especially when volition and perception  as well as speech and action are generally accepted as integral and a prerequisite of knowledge and thought hence death in an absolute sense is usually declared by a second party other than the deceased  today where a definition of the moment of death is required doctors and coroners usually turn to brain death or biological death to define a person as being dead brain death being defined as the complete and irreversible loss of brain function including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life     according to the current neuroscientific view consciousness fails to survive brain death and along with all other mental functions is irrecoverably lost  a neardeath experience nde refers to a personal experience associated with impending death encompassing multiple possible sensations including detachment from the body feelings of levitation total serenity security warmth the experience of absolute dissolution and the presence of a light   explanatory models for the nde can be divided into several broad categories including psychological physiological and transcendental explanations    research from neuroscience considers the nde to be a hallucination caused by various neurological factors such as cerebral anoxia hypercarbia abnormal activity in the temporal lobes or brain damage  while some nde researchers in the field of neardeath studies advocate for a transcendental explanation

V memory erasure is the selective artificial removal of memories or associations from the mind there are many reasons that research is being done on the selective removal of memories potential patients for this research include patients suffering from psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder or substance use disorder among others  memory erasure has been shown to be possible in some experimental conditions some of the techniques currently being investigated are druginduced amnesia selective memory suppression destruction of neurons interruption of memory reconsolidation  and the disruption of specific molecular mechanisms    research focused on gaining a better understanding of what memories are has been going on for many years in this way so has research in memory erasure the basis for the recent history for memory erasure has been focused on determining how the brain actively keeps memories stored and retrieves them there have been several instances where researchers found drugs that when applied to certain areas of the brain usually the amygdala have relative success in being able to erase some memories as early as 2009 researchers were able to trace and destroy neurons involved in supporting the specific type of memory that they were trying to erase this caused the erasure of the target memory  aside from the biotechnology approach to studying memory research in psychiatry on how memories work has also been going on for several years there has been some studies that show that some behavioral therapy can erase bad memories  although there has been some evidence that psychodynamic therapy and other energy techniques  can help with forgetting memories among other psychiatric issues there is no proven therapeutic approach for trying to erase bad memories  there are several different types of possible patients that have the potential to draw great benefit from the selective memory erasure these include people suffering from drug addiction or posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd ptsd patients may include war veterans people who witnessed horrific events victims of violent crimes and many other possibly traumatic events these potential patients have unwanted memories that can be absolutely devastating to their daily lives and cause them to not be able to function properly  along with patients suffering from these severe circumstances the idea of selective memory erasure is a very attractive idea for many thus making the practical use of this technology something that could be used by many people  there are three main types of memories sensory memory shortterm memory and longterm memory sensory memory in short is the ability to hold sensory information for a short period of time for example looking at an object and being able to remember what it looked like moments after shortterm memory is memory that allows a person to recall a short period of time this can be a few seconds to a minute shortterm memory allows people to remember what happened during that short time span without actually practicing the memory longterm memory has a much larger capacity than the prior two and actually stores information from both these types of memories to create a long lasting and large memory longterm memory is the largest target for research involving selective memory erasure within longterm memory there are also different types of longterm memories implicit memory is one type of longterm memory that is generally described as the ability to remember how to use objects or specific movements of the body eg using a hammer another type of longterm memory explicit memory refers to memories that can be consciously drawn upon by a person to remember explicit memory can be split into further subcategories one being episodic memory which is the memory of specific events and the information surrounding it as well as semantic memory which is the ability to remember factual information eg what numbers mean  a type of memory of main concern for memory erasure are emotional memories these memories often involve several different aspects of information in them that can come from a variety of the different categories of memories mentioned above these emotional memories are very powerful memories and can have very strong physiological effects on a person  an example of an emotional memory can be found in patients suffering from ptsd for these patients a traumatic event has left a lasting emotional memory that can have powerful effects on a person even without them consciously retrieving the memory  druginduced amnesia is the idea of selectively losing or inhibiting the creation of unwanted memories using drugs amnesia can be used as a treatment for patients who have experienced psychological trauma or for medical procedures where full anesthesia is not an option druginduced amnesia is also a sideeffect of other drugs like alcohol and rohypnol  there are other drugs that also can cause their users to be put in an amnesic state where they experience some type of amnesia because of their use examples of these drugs include triazolam midazolam and diazepam  there is a growing amount of information that has shown that memory depends largely on the brains synaptic plasticity with a large part of this being dependent on its ability to maintain longterm potentiation ltp  studies on ltp have also started to indicate that there are several molecular mechanisms that may be at the basis of memory storage  thus a more recent approach to erasing memories and the associations the brain makes with objects is disrupting specific molecular mechanisms in the brain that are actively keeping memories active  recovering methamphetamine meth addicts have reported that the sight of certain objects such as a lighter gum or drug paraphernalia can cause massive cravings that can sometimes lead to a break in their mental strength and cause them to relapse  this indicates that longterm memories can be called upon by various different associations that were made with the memory without the conscious effort of the person with an increasing belief that memories are largely supported by functional and structural plasticity deriving from factin polymerization in postsynaptic dendritic spines at excitatory synapses  recent research has been done to target this factin polymerization by using direct actin depolymerization or a myosin ii inhibitor to disrupt the polymerized factin associated with meth memory associations the study indicated types of associations can be disrupted days to weeks after consolidation  although the depolymerization techniques had no effect on food reward based associations or shock based associations the results demonstrate the idea that methassociated memories actin cytoskeleton is constantly changing making it uniquely sensitive to depolymerization during the maintenance phase this is some of the first evidence showing that memories made with different associations are actively maintained using different molecular substrates these results also show that the actin cytoskeleton may be a promising target for selective disruption of unwanted longterm memories  selective memory suppression is the idea that someone can consciously block an unwanted memory there are many different therapeutic techniques or training that has been done to test this idea with some success  many of these techniques focus on blocking the retrieval of a memory using different suppression techniques to slowly teach the brain to suppress the memory although some of these techniques have been useful for some people it has not been shown to be a clear cut solution to forgetting memories because these memories are not truly erased but merely suppressed the question of how permanent the solution is and what actually happens to the memories can be troubling for some  selective memory suppression is also something that can occur without a person being consciously aware of suppressing the creation and retrieval of unwanted memories when this occurs without the person knowing it is usually referred to as memory inhibition the memory itself is called a repressed memory  one of the ways scientists have attempted to erase these memories through suppression is by interrupting the reconsolidation of a memory memory consolidation of a memory is when a person recalls a memory usually a fearful one it becomes susceptible to alteration and then gets stored again  this has led many researchers to believe that this time period is the best time for memories to be altered or erased studies have shown that through behavioral training results showed that they were able to erase memories by tampering with memories during the reconsolidation phase  with evidence showing that different memories excite different neurons or system of neurons in the brain  the technique of destroying select neurons in the brain to erase specific memories is also being researched studies have started to investigate the possibility of using distinct toxins along with biotechnology that allows the researchers to see which areas of the brain are being used during the reward learning process of making a memory to destroy target neurons in a paper published in 2009 authors showed that neurons in the lateral amygdala that had a higher level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response elementbinding protein creb were activated primarily over other neurons by fear memory expression this indicated to them that these neurons were directly involved in the making of the memory trace for that fear memory they then proceeded to train mice using auditory fear training to produce a fear memory they proceeded to check which of the neurons were overexpressing creb and then using a inducible diphtheriatoxin strategy they destroyed those neurons resulting in persistent and strong memory erasure of the fear memory  due to the lack of understanding of the brain this technique of destroying neurons may have a much larger effect on the patient than just the removal of the intended memories due to this complex nature of the brain treatment that would stun the neurons instead of destroying them could be another approach that could be taken  emotional freedom techniques eft are selfhelp techniques that do not involve any medication they are designed to help erase traumatic memories or help relieve the user of any emotional angst they may have there is no quality evidence for the effectiveness of eft beyond placebo  as with most new technologies the idea of being able to erase memories comes with many ethical questions one ethical question that arises is the idea that although there are some extremely painful memories that some people for example ptsd patients would like to be rid of not all unpleasant memories are bad  the ability to soften or erase memories could have drastic effects on how society functions the ability to remember unpleasant effects from ones past has a huge impact on the future actions they may take remembering and learning from past mistakes is crucial in the emotional development of a person and helps to ensure they do not repeat previous errors  the ability to erase memory could also have a massive impact on the law when it comes to determining the outcome of a trial the ability to modify memory could have a massive impact on the judicial system another ethical question that arises is to how the government will use this technology and what restrictions would need to be put in place some worry that if soldiers can go into battle knowing that the memories created during that time period can simply be erased they may not uphold military morale and standards  memory erasure has also been a common topic of interest in science fiction and other fiction several notable comics tv shows and movies feature mindwipes including telefon total recall men in black eternal sunshine of the spotless mind the bourne identity and dollhouse  novels that feature memory erasure include the invincible by stanis\u0142aw lem and some of the harry potter novels including harry potter and the chamber of secrets by j k rowling also the giver by lois lowry deals with this subject several works by philip k dick are about mindwipes including paycheck and we can remember it for you wholesale inspiration for total recall

V phonetotopy is the concept that articulatory features as well as perceptual features of speech sounds are ordered in the brain in a similar way as tone tonotopy articulation and its somatosensory feedback somatotopy or visual location of an object retinotopy it is assumed that a phonetotopic ordering of speech sounds as well as of syllables can be found at a supramodal speech processing level ie at a phonetic speech processing level within the brain the concept of phonetotopy was introduced in kröger et al 2009 on the basis of modeling speech production speech perception as well as speech acquisition  moreover fmri measurements on ordering of vowels with respect to phonetic features  as well as eegarray measurements on vowel and syllable articulation  support this concept the concept of phonetotopy at least underpins the concept of distinctive features which are phonetically based features of speech sounds ie based in perceptual as well as in articulatory domain but which as well are linguistically or phonologically relevant and thus are realized in a language specific way in humans

V pyloroplasty is a surgery performed to widen the opening at the lower part of the stomach also known as the pylorus  when the pylorus thickens it becomes difficult for food to pass through  the surgery is performed to widen the band of muscle known as the pyloric sphincter a ring of smooth muscular fibers that surrounds the pylorus and helps to regulate digestion and prevent reflux see illustration   the widening of the pyloric sphincter enables the contents of the stomach to pass into the first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum    pyloroplasty can be performed on a narrowed or thickened pylorus but also on a normal pylorus  pyloroplasty is used to treat those who have complications causing a blockage of the pylorus commonly peptic ulcers  it also can be performed on patients at high risk for gastric or peptic ulcer disease pud  pyloroplasty is almost never performed by itself it is most commonly paired with another procedure like a vagotomy  nearly 4 million people in the us have pud it is estimated that 5 out of every 100000 adults in us will develop a peptic ulcer  8090 of primary ulcers are believed to be caused by helicobacter pylori bacteria and infection by h pylori occurs more often in black and hispanic populations than white pud can occur in patients of all ages  pyloroplasty is performed while the patient is under general anesthesia and placed in the supine position   the surgery can be performed as an open surgery or by a laparoscope if performed as an open surgery the surgeon will make a large surgical cut on the stomach to open the area and cut through some of the pyloric sphincter to widen and relax it  a midline incision is most commonly used for this procedure  if performed by laparoscope 3 to 5 small cuts are made on the stomach the stomach is filled with gas so that the surgeon looking through the small camera can see the area the pyloric sphincter is then widened in the same way as in an open surgery  pyloroplasty allows for rapid emptying of the contents of the stomach into the duodenum but may cause reflux of contents of the small intestine back into the stomach  there are multiple types of pyloroplasty techniques the most commonly performed pyloroplasty is known as heinekemikulicz pyloroplasty this type consists of a transversely closed longitudinal incision across the pylorus another technique is known as jaboulay pyloroplasty which is not a pylorus incision but a sidetoside gastroduodenostomy lastly finney pyloroplasty is the same technique as jaboulay pyloroplasty but also with a pylorus incision  after the surgery the patients breathing blood pressure temperature heart rate fluid intake and output respiration and operative site will be monitored typically about 8 hours after surgery the patient may be able to walk a short distance and walk increasing distances over the next 23 days  most patients are released after 24 hours and recover quickly and completely most people can slowly begin a regular diet within 23 weeks  risks include those general to surgery such as reactions to medications bleeding blood clots or infection risks specific to pyloroplasty include damage to the intestines chronic diarrhea mucosal perforations leakage of the contents of the stomach malnutrition bile reflux vomiting and hernias    some variants of pyloroplasty are pyloric dilatation and pyloromyotomy which are less invasive alternative procedures to pyloroplasty include gastrojejunostomy and antrectomy

V heart nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale nanotechnology research   nanotechnology deals with structures and materials that are approximately one to onehundred nanometers in length at this microscopic level quantum mechanics take place and are in effect resulting in behaviors that would seem quite strange compared to what humans see with the naked eye regular matter nanotechnology is used for a wide variety of fields of technology ranging from energy to electronics to medicine in the category of medicine nanotechnology is still relatively new and has not yet been widely adopted by the field its possible that nanotechnology could be the new breakthrough of medicine and may eventually be the solution and cure for many of the health problems that humans encounter nanotechnology may lead to the cure for illnesses such as the common cold diseases and cancer it is already starting to be used as a treatment for some serious health issues more specifically it is being used to treat the heart and cancer nanotechnology in the field of medicine is more commonly referred to as nanomedicine nanomedicine that deals with helping the heart is really starting to take off and gain in popularity compared to most of the other fields that nanomedicine currently has to offer there are several heart problems that could potentially be used to treat heart disease in the near future it should hopefully be able to treat heart valves that are defective and detect and treat arterial plaque in the heart nanotechnology made clear nanomedicine should be able to help heal the hearts of people that have already been victims of heart disease and heart attacks on the other hand it will also play a key role in finding people with a high risk of having heart disease and will be able to help prevent heart attacks from happening in the first place nanotechnology of the heart is a lot less invasive than surgery because everything is occurring at a minuscule level in the body compared to relatively large tissues that are dealt with in surgery with our technology today heart surgeries are performed to treat the damaged heart tissue that resulted from a heart attack this is a major surgery that usually takes a couple of months to recover from webmd  better information better health during this period patients are extremely limited in the activities that they can do this long recovery process is an inconvenience to the patients and with the growth of medicine it most likely wont be very long before a more efficient method for treating heart attack patients will be developed and used  the method that is the frontrunner to replace major heart surgery is the use of nanotechnology there are a couple alternate ways to heart surgery that nanotechnology will potentially be able to offer in the future with people that have heart disease or that have suffered a heart attack their hearts are often damaged and weakened the more minor forms of heart failure do not require surgery and are often treated with medications webmd  better information better health the use of nanotechnology on treating damaged hearts will not replace these milder heart problems but rather the more serious heart problems that currently require surgery or sometimes even heart transplants a group of engineers doctors and materials scientists at mit and childrens hospital boston have teamed together and are starting the movement of finding a way to use nanotechnology to strengthen the weakened heart tissue mit  massachusetts institute of technology the first method uses nanotechnology combined with tissue engineering and gold nanowires are placed and woven into the damaged parts of the heart essentially replacing the nonfunctioning or dead tissues  tissue regenerationthe other approach would potentially use minuscule nanoparticles that would travel through the body and find dying heart tissue the nanoparticles would be carrying objects such as stem cells growth factors drugs and other therapeutic compounds  then the nanoparticles would release the compounds and inject them into the damaged heart tissue this would theoretically lead to the regeneration of the tissue  being able to fix cardiac tissue that has been damaged from a heart attack or heart disease is not very simple and it is one of the major challenges today in the field of tissue engineering popular science this is because heart cells are not the easiest objects to create in a lab it takes an enormous amount of special care and work to develop the cells so that they beat in sync with one another popular science even after the heart cells have finally been made it is also a large task to insert the cells into the inoperable parts of the heart and to get them working in unison with the tissues that were still working properly popular science there have been several successful examples of this with the use of a stemcell based heart patch developed by duke university researchers popular science the biomaterials that make up the patch are usually made of either biological polymers like alginate or synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid nature nanotechnology these materials are good at organizing the cells into functioning tissues however they act as insulators and are poor conductors of electricity which is a major problem especially in the heart nature nanotechnology since the electrical signals that are sent between calcium ions are what control when the cardiomyocytes of the heart contract which makes the heart beat the stemcell heart patch is not very efficient and not as effective as doctors would like it to be popular science the results of the patch not being very conductive is that the cells are not able to attain a smooth continuous beat throughout the entire tissue containing the stem cells this results in the heart not functioning properly which in turn could mean that more heart problems might arise due to the implanting of the stem cells recently  there have been some new developments in the field of nanotechnology that will be more efficient than the poorly conducting stemcellbased patch nature nanotechnology scientists and researchers found a way for these stem cell patches also known as tissue scaffolds to be conductive and therefore become exponentially  more effective nature nanotechnology they found that by growing gold nanowires into and through the patches they were able to greatly increase the electrical conductivity  the nanowires are thicker than the original scaffold and the cells are better organized as well  there is also an increase in production of the proteins needed for muscle calcium binding and contraction  the gold nanowires poke through the stem cells scaffolding material which strengthens the electrical communication between surrounding heart cells  without the nanowires the stem cell patches produced a minute current and the cells would only beat in small clusters at the stimulation origin  with the nanowires the cells seem to contract together even when they are clustered far away from the source of stimulation  the use of gold nanowires with the stem cell heart patches is still a relatively new concept and it will probably be awhile before they will be used in humans it is hoped that the nanowires will be tested in live animals in the near future  another way that nanotechnology will potentially be used to help fix damaged heart tissues is through the use of guided nanoparticle missiles  these nanoparticles can cling to and attach to artery walls and secrete medicine at a slow rate mitmassachusetts institute of technology the particles known as nanoburrs due to the fact that that they are coated with little protein fragments that stick to and target certain proteins the nanoburrs can be made to release the drug that is attached to them over the course of several days mitmassachusetts institute of technology they are unique compared to regular drugs because they can find the particular damaged tissue attach to it and release the drug payload that is attached to it mitmassachusetts institute of technology what happens is the nanoburrs are targeted to a certain structure known as the basement membrane this membrane lines the arterial walls and is only present if the area is damaged nanoburrs could be able to carry drugs that are effective in treating the heart and also potentially carry stem cells to help regenerate the damaged heart tissue mitmassachusetts institute of technology the particles are made up of three different layers and are sixty nanometers in diameter mitmassachusetts institute of technologythe outer layer is a coating of polymer called peg and its job is to protect the drug from disintegrating while it is traveling through the body the middle layer consists of a fatty substance and the inner core contains the actual drug along with a polymer chain which controls the amount of time it will take before the drug is released mitmassachusetts institute of technology in a study done on rats the nanoparticles were injected directly into the rats tail and they still were able to reach the desired target the left carotid artery at a rate that was twice the amount of the nontargeted nanoparticles mitmassachusetts institute of technology because the particles can deliver drugs over a long period of time and can be injected intravenously the patients would not need to have multiple repeated injections or invasive surgeries on the heart which would be a lot more convenient the only downside to this is that the existing delivery approaches are invasive requiring either a direct injection into the heart catheter procedures or surgical implants  there is no question however that the future of heart repairs and heart diseaseattack prevention will definitely involve the use of nanotechnology in some way polyketal nanoparticles are phsensitive hydrophobic nanoparticles formulated from poly14phenyleneacetone dimethylene ketal  they are an acidsensitive vehicle of drug delivery specifically designed for targeting the environments of tumors phagosomes and inflammatory tissue  in such acidic environments these nanoparticles undergo accelerated hydrolysis into low molecular weight hydrophilic compounds consequently releasing their therapeutic contents at a faster rate  unlike polyesterbased nanoparticles polyketal nanoparticles do not generate acidic degradation products following hydrolysis    postmyocardial infarction inflammatory leukocytes invade the myocardium leukocytes contain high amounts of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph and nox2   nox2 and nadph oxidase combine to act as a major source of cardiac superoxide production which in excess can lead to myocyte hypertrophy apoptosis fibrosis and increased matrix metalloproteinase2 expression  in a mousemodel study by somasuntharam et al 2013 polyketal nanoparticles were used as a delivery vehicle for sirna to target and inhibit nox2 in the infarcted heart  following intramyocardial injection in vivo nox2sirna nanoparticles prevented upregulation of nox2nadph oxidase and improved fractional shortening  when taken up by macrophages in the myocardium following a mi the nanoparticles degraded in the acidic environment of the endosomesphagosomes releasing nox2specific sirna into the cytoplasm  polyketal nanoparticles have also been used in the infarcted mouse heart to prevent ischemiareperfusion injury caused by reactive oxygen species ros  levels of the antioxidant cuznsuperoxide dismutase sod1 which scavenges harmful ros decrease following mi  sod1enacapsulated polyketal nanoparticles are able to scavenge reperfusioninjury induced ros  furthermore this treatment improved fractional shortening suggesting the benefit of targeted delivery by polyketals one of the key advantages of polyketal use is that they do not exacerbate the inflammatory response even when administered at concentrations exceeding therapeutic limits  in contrast to commonlyused polylacticcoglycolic acid plga nanoparticles polyketal nanoparticle administration in mice instigates little recruitment of inflammatory cells  additionally intramuscular injection of polyketals into the leg of rats shows no significant

V the ear is the organ that detects sound it not only receives sound but also aids in balance and body position the ear is part of the auditory system often the entire organ is considered the ear though it may also be considered just the visible portion in most mammals the visible ear is a flap of tissue that is also called the pinna or auricle in humans and is the first of many steps in hearing vertebrates have a pair of ears placed somewhat symmetrically on opposite sides of the head this arrangement aids in the ability to localize sound sources   the shape of the outer ear of mammals varies widely across species however the inner workings of mammalian ears including humans are very similar the outer ear is the most external portion of the ear the outer ear includes the fleshy visible outer ear called the pinna or auricle the ear canal and the outer layer of the tympanic membrane also known as the ear drum    the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in humans and almost all vertebrates and consequently the word ear may be used to refer to the pinna alone the auricle consists of the curving outer rim the helix the inner curved rim the antihelix and opens into the ear canal properly called the external acoustic meatus the tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal the ear canal stretches for a distance of about 1 inch and consists of an inner portion surrounded by bone and an outer portion surrounded by cartilage the skin surrounding the external acoustic meatus contains glands that produce ear wax cerumen the ear canal ends at the external surface of the ear drum tympanic membrane     two sets of muscles are associated with the outer ear the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles in some mammals these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna    in humans these muscle have very little action if any at all  these muscles are supplied by the facial nerve which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself as well as the ear cavity the vagus nerve auriculotemporal nerve of the mandibular nerve lesser occipital branch of c2 and the greater occipital nerve branch of c3 all supply sensation to portions of the outer ear and surrounding skin    the auricle consists of a single piece of fibrocartilage with a complicated relief on the anterior concave side and a fairly smooth configuration on the posterior convex side the darwinian tubercle which is present in some people lies in the descending part of the helix and corresponds to the true ear tip of the longeared mammals the lobule merely contains subcutaneous tissue  in some animals with mobile pinnae like the horse each pinna can be aimed independently to better receive the sound for these animals the pinnae help localize the direction of the sound source human beings localize sound within the central nervous system by comparing arrivaltime differences and loudness from each ear in brain circuits that are connected to both ears this process is commonly referred to as eps or echo positioning system the middle ear is an airfilled cavity behind the tympanic membrane includes three bones ossicles the malleus or hammer incus or anvil and stapes or stirrup the middle ear also connects to the upper throat via the eustachian tube   the three ossicles transmit sound from the tympanic membrane to the secondary tympanic membrane which is situated within the oval window and is one of the two windows between the middle ear and the inner ear the malleus bone is connected to the tympanic membrane and transmits vibrations of the membrane produced by sound waves the malleus has a long process the manubrium or handle that is attached to the mobile portion of the eardrum the incus bone is the bridge between the malleus and stapes the stapes bone connects to the oval window and is the smallest named bone in the human body the three bones are arranged so that movement of the tympanic membrane causes movement of the malleus which causes movement of the incus which causes movement of the stapes when the stapes footplate pushes on the oval window it causes movement of fluid within the cochlea a portion of the inner ear   the ossicles help in amplification of sound waves by nearly thirty times the round window is the second of the two windows between the middle ear and the inner ear the round window allows for the fluid within the inner ear to move as the stapes pushes the tympanic membrane in the inner ear fluid moves and pushes the round window membrane out a corresponding amount in humans and other land animals the middle ear like the ear canal is normally filled with air unlike the open ear canal however the air of the middle ear is not in direct contact with the atmosphere outside the body the eustachian tube connects from the chamber of the middle ear to the back of the nasopharynx the middle ear is very much like a specialized paranasal sinus called the tympanic cavity it like the paranasal sinuses is a hollow mucosalined cavity in the skull that is ventilated through the nose the mastoid portion of the human temporal bone which can be felt as a bump in the skull behind the pinna also contains air which is ventilated through the middle ear normally the eustachian tube is collapsed but it gapes open both with swallowing and with positive pressure when taking off in an airplane the surrounding air pressure goes from higher on the ground to lower in the sky the air in the middle ear expands as the plane gains altitude and pushes its way into the back of the nose and mouth on the way down the volume of air in the middle ear shrinks and a slight vacuum is produced active opening of the eustachian tube is required to equalize the pressure between the middle ear and the surrounding atmosphere as the plane descends the diver also experiences this change in pressure but with greater rates of pressure change active opening of the eustachian tube is required more frequently as the diver goes deeper into higher pressure abnormalities such as impacted ear wax occlusion of the external ear canal fixed or missing ossicles or holes in the tympanic membrane generally produce conductive hearing loss conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid buildup in the normally airfilled space tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ears tympanic membrane and ossicles grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact ear drum sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively the inner ear is split anatomically into bony and membranous labyrinths this contains the sensory organs for balance and motion namely the vestibules of the ear utricle and saccule and the semicircular canals this also contains the sensory organ for hearing the cochlea   the bony labyrinth refers to a bone matrix which opens externally into the oval window which connects with the incus which transmits vibrations into a fluid called endolymph which fills the membranous labyrinth the endolymph is situated in two vestibules the utricle and saccule and eventually transmits to the cochlea a spiralshaped structure the cochlea consists of three fluidfilled spaces the scala tympani the scala vestibuli and the scala media which together are responsible for hearing   the blood supply of the ear differs according to each part of the ear the external ear is supplied by the anterior and posterior auricular arteries which are branches of the superficial temporal artery and external carotid artery respectively and branches of the occipital artery   the middle ear is supplied by mastoid branch of the occipital or posterior auricular arteries tympanic branch of the maxillary artery and some branches from different arteries including the middle meningeal artery ascending pharyngeal artery internal carotid artery and the artery of pterygoid canal   the inner ear is supplied by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery and the labyrinthine artery arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the basilar artery   humans and primates such as the orangutan and chimpanzee have ear muscles that are minimally developed and nonfunctional yet still large enough to be easily identifiable  these undeveloped muscles are vestigial structures an ear muscle that cannot move the ear for whatever reason can no longer be said to have any biological function this serves as evidence of homology between related species in humans there is variability in these muscles such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions and it has been said that it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials  in such primates the inability to move the ear is compensated mainly by the ability to turn the head on a horizontal plane an ability which is not common to most monkeysa function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another  sound waves travel through the outer ear are modulated by the middle ear and are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the inner ear this nerve transmits information to the temporal lobe of the brain where it is registered as sound sound that travels through the outer ear impacts on the tympanic membrane ear drum and causes it to vibrate the three ossicles bones transmit this sound to a second window the oval window which protects the fluidfilled inner ear in detail the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound which impacts on the tympanic membrane the malleus rests on the membrane and receives the vibration this vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window two small muscles the tensor tympani and stapedius also help modulate noise the tensor tympani dampens noise and the stapedius decreases the receptivity to highfrequency noise vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the ventricles and cochlea    the hollow channels of the inner ear are filled with liquid and contain a sensory epithelium that is studded with hair cells the microscopic hairs of these cells are structural protein filaments that project out into the fluid the hair cells are mechanoreceptors that release a chemical neurotransmitter when stimulated sound waves moving through fluid flows against the receptor cells of the organ of corti the fluid pushes the filaments of individual cells movement of the filaments causes receptor cells to become open to the potassiumrich endolymph this causes the cell to depolarise and creates an action potential that is transmitted along the spiral ganglion which sends information through the auditory portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the temporal lobe of the brain    the human ear can generally hear sounds with frequencies between 20 hz and 20 khz the audio range although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory portion of the central nervous system as well as a working ear human deafness extreme insensitivity to sound most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central auditory system sound below 20hz is considered infrasound which the ear cannot process  providing balance when moving or stationary is also a central function of the ear the ear facilitates two types of balance static balance which allows a person to feel the effects of gravity and dynamic balance which allows a person to sense acceleration static balance is provided through the two ventricles the utricle and the saccule cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer each cell has 5070 small filaments and one large filament the kinocilium within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths tiny formations of calcium carbonate when a person moves these otoliths shift position this shift alters the positions of the filaments which opens ion channels within the cell membranes creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve    dynamic balance is provided through the three semicircular canals these are three canals situated perpendicularly at the end of each canal is a slight enlargement known as the ampulla which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula the fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head when a person changes acceleration the inertia of the fluid changes this affects the pressure on the cupula and results in the opening of ion channels this causes depolarisation which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve    deafness refers to a partial or total loss of the ability to hear this may be a result of injury or damage congenital disease or physiological causes when deafness is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear it is known as conductive deafness when deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear vestibulochoclear nerve or brain it is known as sensorineural deafness vertigo refers to the inappropriate perception of motion this is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system one common cause of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal the displaced otolith rests on the cupola causing a sensation of movement when there is none menieres disease labyrinthitis strokes and other infective and congenital diseases may also result in the perception of vertigo    the auricle can be easily damaged because it is skincovered cartilage with only a thin padding of connective tissue rough handling of the ear can cause enough swelling to jeopardize the bloodsupply to its framework the auricular cartilage that entire cartilage framework is fed by a thin covering membrane called the perichondrium meaning literally around the cartilage any fluid from swelling or blood from injury that collects between the perichondrium and the underlying cartilage puts the cartilage in danger of being separated from its supply of nutrients if portions of the cartilage starve and die the ear never heals back into its normal shape instead the cartilage becomes lumpy and distorted a phenomenon called wrestlers ear because wrestling is one of the most common ways such an injury occurs or cauliflower ear the lobule of the ear ear lobe is the one part of the human auricle that normally contains no cartilage instead it is a wedge of adipose tissue fat covered by skin there are many normal variations to the shape of the ear lobe which may be small or large tears of the earlobe can be generally repaired with good results since there is no cartilage there is not the risk of deformity from a blood clot or pressure injury to the ear lobe other injuries to the external ear occur fairly frequently and can leave minor to major deformity some of the more common ones include laceration from glass knives and bite injuries avulsion injuries cancer frostbite burn and repeated twisting or pulling of a childs ear a form of physical child discipline ear canal injuries can come from firecrackers and other explosives and mechanical trauma from placement of foreign bodies into the ear the ear canal is most often selftraumatized from efforts at ear cleaning the outer part of the ear canal rests on the flesh of the head the inner part rests in the opening of the bony skull called the external auditory meatus the skin is very different on each part the outer skin is thick and contains glands as well as hair follicles the glands make cerumen also called ear wax the skin of the outer part moves a bit if the pinna is pulled it is only loosely applied to the underlying tissues the skin of the bony canal on the other hand is not only among the most delicate skin in the human body it is tightly applied to the underlying bone a slender object used to blindly clean cerumen out of the ear often results instead with the wax being pushed in and contact with the thin skin of the bony canal is likely to lead to laceration and bleeding like outer ear trauma middle ear trauma most often comes from blast injuries and insertion of foreign objects into the ear skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures the temporal bone can also cause damage to the middle ear small perforations of the tympanic membrane usually heal on their own but large perforations may require grafting displacement of the ossicles will cause a conductive hearing loss that can only be corrected with surgery forcible displacement of the stapes into the inner ear can cause a sensory neural hearing loss that cannot be corrected even if the ossicles are put back into proper position because human skin has a top waterproof layer of dead skin cells that are constantly shedding displacement of portions of the tympanic membrane or ear canal into the middle ear or deeper areas by trauma can be particularly traumatic if the displaced skin lives within a closed area the shed surface builds up over months and years and forms a cholesteatoma the oma ending of that word indicates a tumour in medical terminology and although cholesteatoma is not a neoplasm but a skin cyst it can expand and erode the ear structures the treatment for cholesteatoma is surgical there are two principal damage mechanisms to the inner ear in industrialized society and both injure hair cells the first is exposure to elevated sound levels noise trauma and the second is exposure to drugs and other substances ototoxicity in 1972 the us epa told congress that at least 34million people were exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss  the worldwide implication for industrialized countries would place this exposed population in the hundreds of millions the national institute for occupational safety and health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty 11 and the percentage that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure 24  furthermore according to the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes approximately twentytwo million 17 us workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise  workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noiseinduced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection the auricles also have an effect on facial appearance in western societies protruding ears present in about 5 of ethnic europeans have been considered unattractive particularly if asymmetric the first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature in 1881 the ears have also been ornamented with jewelry for thousands of years traditionally by piercing ear piercing of the earlobe in both modern and primitive cultures ornaments are placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes allowing for larger plug jewellery to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings or from traumatic pull of an earring for example by snagging on a sweater is fairly common  the repair of such a tear is usually not difficult a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty in the rare cases when no pinna is formed atresia or is extremely small microtia reconstruction of the auricle is possible most often a cartilage graft from another part of the body generally rib cartilage is used to form the matrix of the ear and skin grafts or rotation flaps are used to provide the covering skin based on technology developed in 1997 and demonstrated by the earmouse an ear shape can be grown in the patients body using their own cartilage to seed a frame temporarily implanted under the skin when babies are born without an auricle on one or both sides or when the auricle is very tiny the human ear canal is ordinarily either small or absent and the middle ear often has deformities the initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the babys hearing and the condition of the ear canal as well as the middle and inner ear depending on the results of tests reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages with planning for any possible repairs of the rest of the ear    the pinna helps direct sound through the ear canal to the tympanic membrane eardrum the complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus echolocation signals and any sound produced by the prey these ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals such as the bat ayeaye lesser galago bateared fox mouse lemur and others    comparative anatomy of primate ears human left and barbary macaque right bat pinnae come in different sizes and shapes only vertebrate animals have ears though many invertebrates detect sound using other kinds of sense organs in insects tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds they are located either on the head or elsewhere depending on the insect family  the tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals the female cricket fly ormia ochracea has tympanal organs on each side of her abdomen they are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums but because they are linked they provide acute directional information the fly uses her ears to detect the call of her host a male cricket depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from the flys hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies this difference may be as little as 50billionths of a second but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitize it  simpler structures allow arthropod to detect nearfield sounds spiders and cockroaches for example have hairs on their legs which are used for detecting sound caterpillars may also have hairs on their body that perceive vibrations  and allow them to respond to sound

V wernickes area \u02c8v\u025b\u0259rn\u1d7bk\u0259 or \u02c8v\u025b\u0259rn\u1d7bki german \u02c8v\u025b\u0281n\u026ak\u0259 also called wernickes speech area is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex linked since the late nineteenth century to speech the other is brocas area it is involved in the production of written and spoken language it is traditionally thought to be in brodmann area 22 which is located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus stg in the dominant cerebral hemisphere  which is the left hemisphere in about 95 of right handed individuals and 60 of left handed individuals damage caused to wernickes area results in receptive fluent aphasia this means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words but will lack meaning this is unlike nonfluent aphasia in which the person will use meaningful words but in a nonfluent telegraphic manner    wernickes area is classically located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus stg in the most commonly left cerebral hemisphere this area encircles the auditory cortex on the lateral sulcus the part of the brain where the temporal lobe and parietal lobe meet  this area is neuroanatomically described as the posterior part of brodmann area 22 however there is an absence of consistent definitions as to the location  some identify it with the unimodal auditory association in the superior temporal gyrus anterior to the primary auditory cortex the anterior part of ba 22  this is the site most consistently implicated in auditory word recognition by functional brain imaging experiments   others include also adjacent parts of the heteromodal cortex in ba 39 and ba40 in the parietal lobe  while previously thought to connect wernickes area and brocas area new research demonstrates that the arcuate fasciculus instead connects to posterior receptive areas with premotormotor areas and not to brocas area  consistent with the word recognition site identified in brain imaging the uncinate fasciculus connects anterior superior temporal regions with brocas area  research using transcranial magnetic stimulation suggests that the area corresponding to the wernickes area in the nondominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous wordssuch as river when given the ambiguous word bank in contrast the wernickes area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings teller given bank  this area is also important in understanding jokes  neuroimaging suggests the functions earlier attributed to wernickes area occur more broadly in the temporal lobe and indeed happen also in brocas area  the range of areas implicated in speech processing go well beyond the classical language areas typically mentioned for speech the vast majority of textbooks still state that this aspect of perception and language processing occurs in wernickes area the posterior third of the stg  support for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study done at university of rochester in which american sign language native speakers were subject to mris while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax relationship is determined by the word order or inflection relationship is determined by physical motion of moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex associated with ability to put information into sequences being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes associated with dividing information into its constituent parts being more active in the inflection condition however these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap these findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process the brain may be using fairly basic preexisting computational methods  wernickes area is named after carl wernicke a german neurologist and psychiatrist who in 1874 hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words  he did this on the basis of the location of brain injuries that caused aphasia receptive aphasia in which such abilities are preserved is also known as wernickes aphasia in this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension while speech retains a naturalsounding rhythm and a relatively normal syntax language as a result is largely meaningless a condition sometimes called fluent or jargon aphasia while neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to wernickes area is common in people with receptive aphasia this is not always so some people may use the right hemisphere for language and isolated damage of wernickes area cortex sparing white matter and other areas may not cause severe receptive aphasia   even when patients with wernickes area lesions have comprehension deficits these are usually not restricted to language processing alone for example one study found that patients with posterior lesions also had trouble understanding nonverbal sounds like animal and machine noises  in fact for wernickes area the impairments in nonverbal sounds were statistically stronger than for verbal sounds

V venous hum is a benign phenomenon at rest 20 of the cardiac output flows to the brain via the internal carotid and vertebral arteries this drains via the internal jugular veins the flow of blood can cause the vein walls to vibrate creating a humming noise which can be heard by the subject typically a peculiar humming sound is heard in the upper chest near the clavicle this may be confused with a heart murmur the venous hum is heard throughout the cardiac cycle the difference is easily detected by placing a finger on the jugular vein when listening to the heart which will abolish or change the noise a true heart murmur will be unaffected by this maneuver the murmur also disappears when the patient is in the supine position or may disappear if the subject turns their head to one side it is also known by the names nuns murmur and bruit de diable the devils noise while a venous hum may provoke consultation with a health care professional it is entirely harmless

V renal failure also known as kidney failure or renal insufficiency is a medical condition in which the kidneys fail to adequately filter waste products from the blood  the two main forms are acute kidney injury which is often reversible with adequate treatment and chronic kidney disease which is often not reversible in both cases there is usually an underlying cause kidney failure is mainly determined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate which is the rate at which blood is filtered in the glomeruli of the kidney the condition is detected by a decrease in or absence of urine production or determination of waste products creatinine or urea in the blood depending on the cause hematuria blood loss in the urine and proteinuria protein loss in the urine may be noted in kidney failure there may be problems with increased fluid in the body leading to swelling increased acid levels raised levels of potassium decreased levels of calcium increased levels of phosphate and in later stages anemia bone health may also be affected longterm kidney problems are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease    kidney failure can be divided into two categories acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease the type of renal failure is differentiated by the trend in the serum creatinine other factors that may help differentiate acute kidney injury from chronic kidney disease include anemia and the kidney size on sonography as chronic kidney disease generally leads to anemia and small kidney size acute kidney injury aki previously called acute renal failure arf   is a rapidly progressive loss of renal function  generally characterized by oliguria decreased urine production quantified as less than 400 ml per day in adults  less than 05 mlkgh in children or less than 1 mlkgh in infants and fluid and electrolyte imbalance aki can result from a variety of causes generally classified as prerenal intrinsic and postrenal the underlying cause must be identified and treated to arrest the progress and dialysis may be necessary to bridge the time gap required for treating these fundamental causes chronic kidney disease ckd can also develop slowly and initially show few symptoms  ckd can be the long term consequence of irreversible acute disease or part of a disease progression acute kidney injuries can be present on top of chronic kidney disease a condition called acuteonchronic kidney failure aocrf the acute part of aocrf may be reversible and the goal of treatment as with aki is to return the patient to baseline kidney function typically measured by serum creatinine like aki aocrf can be difficult to distinguish from chronic kidney disease if the patient has not been monitored by a physician and no baseline ie past blood work is available for comparison symptoms can vary from person to person someone in early stage kidney disease may not feel sick or notice symptoms as they occur when kidneys fail to filter properly waste accumulates in the blood and the body a condition called azotemia very low levels of azotaemia may produce few if any symptoms if the disease progresses symptoms become noticeable if the failure is of sufficient degree to cause symptoms kidney failure accompanied by noticeable symptoms is termed uraemia  symptoms of kidney failure include the following     acute kidney injury previously known as acute renal failure  or aki  usually occurs when the blood supply to the kidneys is suddenly interrupted or when the kidneys become overloaded with toxins causes of acute kidney injury include accidents injuries or complications from surgeries in which the kidneys are deprived of normal blood flow for extended periods of time heartbypass surgery is an example of one such procedure drug overdoses accidental or from chemical overloads of drugs such as antibiotics or chemotherapy may also cause the onset of acute kidney injury unlike chronic kidney disease however the kidneys can often recover from acute kidney injury allowing the patient to resume a normal life people suffering from acute kidney injury require supportive treatment until their kidneys recover function and they often remain at increased risk of developing future kidney failure  among the accidental causes of renal failure is the crush syndrome when large amounts of toxins are suddenly released in the blood circulation after a long compressed limb is suddenly relieved from the pressure obstructing the blood flow through its tissues causing ischemia the resulting overload can lead to the clogging and the destruction of the kidneys it is a reperfusion injury that appears after the release of the crushing pressure the mechanism is believed to be the release into the bloodstream of muscle breakdown products  notably myoglobin potassium and phosphorus  that are the products of rhabdomyolysis the breakdown of skeletal muscle damaged by ischemic conditions the specific action on the kidneys is not fully understood but may be due in part to nephrotoxic metabolites of myoglobin chronic kidney disease ckd has numerous causes the most common causes of ckd are diabetes mellitus and longterm uncontrolled hypertension  polycystic kidney disease is another wellknown cause of ckd the majority of people afflicted with polycystic kidney disease have a family history of the disease other genetic illnesses affect kidney function as well overuse of common drugs such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen paracetamol can also cause chronic kidney damage  some infectious diseases such as hantavirus can attack the kidneys causing kidney failure  the apol1 gene has been proposed as a major genetic risk locus for a spectrum of nondiabetic renal failure in individuals of african origin these include hivassociated nephropathy hivan primary nonmonogenic forms of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and hypertension affiliated chronic kidney disease not attributed to other etiologies  two western african variants in apol1 have been shown to be associated with end stage kidney disease in african americans and hispanic americans   chronic kidney failure is measured in five stages which are calculated using a patients gfr or glomerular filtration rate stage 1 ckd is mildly diminished renal function with few overt symptoms stages 2 and 3 need increasing levels of supportive care from their medical providers to slow and treat their renal dysfunction patients in stages 4 and 5 usually require preparation of the patient towards active treatment in order to survive stage 5 ckd is considered a severe illness and requires some form of renal replacement therapy dialysis or kidney transplant whenever feasible a normal gfr varies according to many factors including sex age body size and ethnic background renal professionals consider the glomerular filtration rate gfr to be the best overall index of kidney function  the national kidney foundation offers an easy to use online gfr calculator  for anyone who is interested in knowing their glomerular filtration rate a serum creatinine level a simple blood test is needed to use the calculator before the advancement of modern medicine renal failure was often referred to as uremic poisoning uremia was the term for the contamination of the blood with urine it is the presence of an excessive amount of urea in blood starting around 1847 this included reduced urine output which was thought to be caused by the urine mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra  the term uremia is now used for the illness accompanying kidney failure

the patient may return to a normal life as soon as possible the replaced function doesnt necessarily have to be related to life support but often is implied by this definition is the fact that the device must not be continuously tethered to a stationary power supply or other stationary resources such as filters or chemical processing units periodic rapid recharging of batteries refilling of chemicals andor cleaningreplacing of filters would exclude a device from being called an artificial organ thus a dialysis machine while a very successful and critically important life support device that completely replaces the duties of a kidney is not an artificial organ at this time an efficient selfcontained artificial kidney has not become available   reasons to construct and install an artificial organ an extremely expensive process initially which may entail many years of ongoing maintenance services not needed by a natural organ might include the use of any artificial organ by humans is almost always preceded by extensive experiments with animals initial testing in humans is frequently limited to those either already facing death or who have exhausted every other treatment possibility rarely testing may be done on healthy volunteers who are scheduled for execution pertaining to violent crimes although not typically thought of as organs one might also consider replacement bone and joints thereof such as hip replacements in this context neurostimulators including deep brain stimulators send electrical impulses to the brain in order to relieve movement disorders including parkinsons disease as well as epilepsy depression and other conditions such as increased bladder secretions rather than replacing existing neural networks to restore function these devices often serve by disrupting the output of existing malfunctioning nerve centers to eliminate symptoms artificial cardia and pylorus can be used to fight esophageal cancer achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease this pertains to gastric repairs specifically of the valves at either end of the stomach  to treat erectile dysfunction both corpora cavernosa can be irreversibly surgically replaced with manually inflatable penile implants this is a drastic therapeutic surgery meant only for men who suffer from complete impotence that has resisted all other treatment approaches an implanted pump in the groin or scrotum can be manipulated by hand to fill these artificial cylinders normally sized to be direct replacements for the natural corpora cavernosa from an implanted reservoir in order to achieve an erection  while natural hearing to the level of musical quality is not typically achieved most recipients are pleased with some finding it useful enough to return to their surgeon with a request to do the other  the most successful functionreplacing artificial eye so far is actually an external miniature digital camera with a remote unidirectional electronic interface implanted on the retina optic nerve or other related locations inside the brain the present state of the art yields only very partial functionality such as recognizing levels of brightness swatches of color andor basic geometric shapes proving the concepts potential while the living eye is indeed a camera it is also much more than that various researchers have demonstrated that the retina performs strategic image preprocessing for the brain the problem of creating a 100 functional artificial electronic eye is even more complex than what is already obvious steadily increasing complexity of the artificial connection to the retina optic nerve or related brain areas advances combined with ongoing advances in computer science is expected to dramatically improve the performance of this technology for the person whose damaged or diseased living eye retains some function other options superior to the electronic eye may be available  while considered a success the use of artificial hearts is limited to patients awaiting transplants whose death is imminent the current state of the heart devices are unable to reliably sustain life beyond about 18 months artificial pacemakers are electronic devices which can either intermittently augment defibrillator mode continuously augment or completely bypass the natural living cardiac pacemaker as needed are so successful that they have become commonplace ventricular assist devices are mechanical circulatory devices that partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart without the removal of the heart itself artificial arms and legs or prosthetics are intended to restore a degree of normal function to amputees mechanical devices that allow amputees to walk again or continue to use two hands have probably been in use since ancient times the most notable one being the simple peg leg surgical procedure for amputation however was not largely successful until around 600 bc armorers of the middle ages created the first sophisticated prostheses using strong heavy inflexible iron to make limbs that the amputee could scarcely control even with the articulated joints invented by ambroise paré in the 1500s the amputee could not flex at will artificial hands of the time were quite beautiful and intricate imitations of real hands but were not exceptionally functional upper limbs developed by peter baliff of berlin in 1812 for belowelbow amputees and van peetersen in 1844 for aboveelbow amputees were functional but still far less than ideal the nineteenth century saw a lot of changes most initiated by amputees themselves j e hanger an engineering student lost his leg in the civil war he subsequently designed an artificial leg for himself and in 1861 founded a company to manufacture prosthetic legs the j e hanger company is still in existence today another amputee named a a winkley developed a slipsocket belowknee device for himself and with the help of lowell jepson founded the winkley company in 1888 they marketed the legs during the national civil war veterans reunion thereby establishing their company another amputee named d w dorrance invented a terminal device to be used in the place of a hand in 1909 dorrance who had lost his right arm in an accident was unhappy with the prosthetic arms then available until his invention they had consisted of a leather socket and a heavy steel frame and either had a heavy cosmetic hand in a glove a rudimentary mechanical hand or a passive hook incapable of prehension dorrance invented a split hook that was anchored to the opposite shoulder and could be opened with a strap across the back and closed by rubber bands his terminal device the hook is still considered to be a major advancement for amputees because it restored their prehension abilities to some extent modified hooks are still used today though they might be hidden by realisticlooking skin hepalife is developing a bioartificial liver device intended for the treatment of liver failure using stem cells the artificial liver currently under development is designed to serve as a supportive device either allowing the liver to regenerate upon acute liver failure or to bridge the patients liver functions until a transplant is available  it is only made possible by the fact that it uses real liver cells hepatocytes and even then it is not a permanent substitute for a liver on the other hand researchers colin mcgucklin professor of regenerative medicine at newcastle university and nico forraz senior research associate and clinical sciences business manager at newcastle university say that pieces of artificial liver could be used to repair livers injured in the next five years these artificial livers could also be used outside the body in a manner analogous to the dialysis process used to keep alive patients whose kidneys have failed  the researchers from japan found that a mixture of human liver precursor cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs and two other cell types can spontaneously form threedimensional structures dubbed liver buds in the mice these liver buds formed functional connections with natural blood vessels and perform some liverspecific functions such as breaking down drugs in the bloodstream  with some almost fully functional artificial lungs promise to be a great success in near future  an ann arbor company mc3 is currently working on this type of medical device for the treatment of diabetes numerous promising techniques are currently being developed including some that incorporate donated living tissue housed in special materials to prevent the patients immune system from killing the foreign live components the two main methods for replacing bladder function involve either redirecting urine flow or replacing the bladder in situ  standard methods for replacing the bladder involve fashioning a bladderlike pouch from intestinal tissue  an alternative emerging method involves growing a bladder from cells taken from the patient and allowed to grow on a bladdershaped scaffold  reproductive age patients who develop cancer often receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy which damages oocytes and leads to early menopause an artificial human ovary has been developed at brown university  with selfassembled microtissues created using novel 3d petri dish technology the artificial ovary will be used for the purpose of in vitro maturation of immature oocytes and the development of a system to study the effect of environmental toxins on folliculogenesis an implantable machine that performs the function of a thymus does not exist however researchers have been able to grow a thymus from reprogrammed fibroblasts they expressed hope that the approach could one day replace or supplement neonatal thymus transplantation  surgeons in sweden performed the first implantation of a synthetic trachea in july 2011 for a 36yearold patient who was suffering from cancer stem cells taken from the patients hip were treated with growth factors and incubated on a plastic replica of his natural trachea  it is also possible to construct and install an artificial organ to give its possessor abilities which are not naturally occurring research is proceeding particularly in areas of vision memory and information processing however this idea is still in its infancy some current research focuses on restoring inoperative shortterm memory in accident victims and lost access to longterm memory in dementia patients success here would lead to widespread interest in applications for persons whose memory is considered healthy to dramatically enhance their memory far beyond what can be achieved with mnemonic techniques given that our understanding of how living memory actually works is incomplete it is unlikely this scenario will become reality in the near future one area of success was achieved in 2002 when a british scientist kevin warwick had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the internet with this in place he carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the internet to control a robotic hand a form of extended sensory input and the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans  another idea with significant consequences is that of implanting a language translator for diplomatic and military applications while machine translation does exist it is presently neither good nor small enough to fulfill its promise this might also include the existing and controversial when applied to humans practice of implanting subcutaneous chips integrated circuits for identification and location purposes an example of this is the rfid tags made by verichip corporation npr reported scientists are developing palmsized mock human organs designed to test drugs and help understand the basic function of healthy or diseased organs researchers are hopeful this technology may speed up drug development and make it less expensive

V a wisdom tooth or third molar is one of the three molars per quadrant of the human dentition it is the most posterior most distal of the three wisdom teeth generally erupt between the ages of 17 and 25  most adults have four wisdom teeth a third molar in each of the four quadrants but it is possible to have fewer or more in which case the extras are called supernumerary teeth wisdom teeth commonly affect other teeth as they develop  becoming impacted or coming in sideways they are often extracted when this occurs   agenesis of wisdom teeth differs by population ranging from practically zero in tasmanian aborigines to nearly 100 in indigenous mexicans  the difference is related to the pax9 gene and perhaps other genes  wisdom teeth are vestigial third molars that used to help human ancestors in grinding down plant tissue the common postulation  is that the skulls of human ancestors had larger jaws with more teeth which were possibly used to help chew down foliage to compensate for a lack of ability to efficiently digest the cellulose that makes up a plant cell wall as human diets changed smaller jaws gradually evolved yet the third molars or wisdom teeth still commonly develop in human mouths  wisdom teeth often notated clinically as m3 for third molar have long been identified as a source of problems and continue to be the most commonly impacted teeth in the human mouth the oldest known impacted wisdom tooth belonged to a european woman of the magdalenian period 1800010000 bc  a lack of room to allow the teeth to erupt results in a risk of periodontal disease and dental cavities that increases with age  only a small minority less than 2 of adults age 65 years or older maintain the teeth without caries or periodontal disease and 13 maintain unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or periodontal disease  impacted wisdom teeth are classified by the direction and depth of impaction the amount of available space for tooth eruption and the amount soft tissue or bone or both that covers them the classification structure allows clinicians to estimate the probabilities of impaction infections and complications associated with wisdom teeth removal  wisdom teeth are also classified by the presence or absence of symptoms and disease  treatment of an erupted wisdom tooth is the same as any other tooth in the mouth if impacted treatment can be localized to the infected tissue overlying the impaction   extraction  or coronectomy  although formally known as third molars the common name is wisdom teeth because they appear so late  much later than the other teeth at an age where people are presumably wiser than as a child when the other teeth erupt  the term probably came as a translation of the latin dens sapientiae

V in anatomy the g cell is a type of cell in the stomach and duodenum that secretes gastrin it works in conjunction with gastric chief cells and parietal cells g cells are found deep within the pyloric glands of the stomach antrum and occasionally in the pancreas  and duodenum the vagus nerve innervates the g cells gastrinreleasing peptide is released by the postganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve onto g cells during parasympathetic stimulation the peptide hormone bombesin also stimulates gastrin from g cells gastrinreleasing peptide as well as the presence of amino acids in the stomach stimulates the release of gastrin from the g cells gastrin stimulates enterochromaffinlike cells to secrete histamine  gastrin also targets parietal cells by increasing the amount of histamine and the direct stimulation by gastrin causing the parietal cells to increase hcl secretion in the stomach g cells have a distinctive microscopic appearance that allows one to separate them from other cells in the gastric antrum their nuclei are centrally located in the cell they are found in the middle portion of the gastric glands

V in female human anatomy skenes glands or the skene glands ski\u02d0n usdictsk\u0113n also known as the lesser vestibular glands periurethral glands paraurethral glands  or female prostate are glands located on the anterior wall of the vagina around the lower end of the urethra they drain into the urethra and near the urethral opening and may be near or a part of the gspot these glands are surrounded with tissue which includes the part of the clitoris that reaches up inside the vagina and swells with blood during sexual arousal   the location of the skenes gland is the general area of the vulva glands located on the anterior wall of the vagina around the lower end of the urethra they are homologous with the prostate gland in males  the skenes ducts are a pair of ducts leading from the skenes glands to the surface of the vulva to the left and right of the urethral opening it has been postulated that the skenes glands are the source of female ejaculation  female ejaculate which may emerge during sexual activity for some women especially during female orgasm has a composition somewhat similar to the fluid generated in males by the prostate gland   containing biochemical markers of sexual function like human urinary protein 1  and the enzyme pde5 where women without the gland had lower concentrations  when examined with electron microscopy both glands show similar secretory structures  and both act similarly in terms of prostatespecific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase studies     because they are increasingly perceived as merely different versions of the same gland some researchers are moving away from the term skenes gland and are referring to it instead as the female prostate  in 2002 emanuele jannini of university of laquila in italy showed that there may be an explanation both for female ejaculation and for the frequent denials of its existence skenes glands have highly variable anatomy and in some extreme cases they appear to be absent entirely if skenes glands are the cause of female ejaculation and gspot orgasms this may explain the absence of the phenomenon in many women   it has been demonstrated that a large amount of fluid can be secreted from this gland when stimulated from inside the vagina  some reports indicate that embarrassment regarding female ejaculation and the debated notion that the substance is urine can lead to purposeful suppression of sexual climax leading women to seek medical advice and even undergo surgery to stop the urine  disorders of or related to the skenes gland include  while the glands were first described by the french surgeon alphonse guérin 18161895 they were named after the scottish gynaecologist alexander skene who wrote about it in western medical literature in 1880

V the tympanum is an external hearing structure in animals such as frogs toads insects and mammals  in frogs and toadstympanum is a large external oval shape membrane made up of nonglandular skin   it is located just behind the eye it does not actually process sound waves it simply transmits them to the amphibians inner ear which is protected from water and other foreign objects a frogs ear drum is called a tympanum and works in very much the same way that our human ear drums work a frogs ear drum just like a humans ear drum is a membrane that is stretched across a ring of cartilage like a snare drum that vibrates there is rod that is connected to the ear drum which vibrates by sounds that come at the frog that sound is just pressure waves the rod sloshes around in the inner ear fluid which causes microscopic hairs to move which send signals to the frogs brain for interception a frogs ear lungs also vibrate when sound waves come toward it although they are less sensitive than the frogs ear drum

V super bowl xxxviii  which was broadcast live on february 1 2004 from houston texas on the cbs television network in the united states  was noted for a controversial halftime show in which janet jacksons breast adorned with a nipple shield was exposed by justin timberlake for about half a second in what was later referred to as a wardrobe malfunction  the incident sometimes referred to as nipplegate   was widely discussed along with the rest of the halftime show it led to an immediate crackdown and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting  the federal communications commission fcc fined cbs a record us550000 which was fought in the supreme court  but that fine was appealed and ultimately voided by the third circuit court of appeals in a 2011 ruling and a case to reinstate the fine was refused in 2012   the incident was ridiculed both within the united states and abroad some american commentators saw the incident as a sign of decreasing morality in the national culture while others considered the incident harmless and felt that it received an undue amount of attention and backlash      the increased regulation of broadcasting raised concerns regarding censorship and free speech in the united states  and the fcc increased the fine per indecency violation from us27500 to us325000 shortly after the event  the halftime show that year was produced by mtv and was themed around the networks rock the vote campaign due to the event occurring during a presidential election year following the wardrobe incident the national football league nfl announced that mtv which also produced the halftime show for super bowl xxxv would not be involved in any halftime shows in the future  the exposure was broadcast to a total audience of 1436 million viewers  youtube cofounder jawed karim claims that this incident was what led to the creation of the video sharing website  the incident also made janet jackson the most searched term event and image in internet history as well as the most searched person and term of 2004 and 2005     the incident also broke the record for most searched event over one day  jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of guinness world records as most searched in internet history and the most searched for news item  it became the most watched recorded and replayed television moment in tivo history and enticed an estimated 35000 new tivo subscribers to sign up    the incident also coined the phrase wardrobe malfunction which was later added to the merriamwebsters collegiate dictionary  following the incident media conglomerates involved with the broadcast who were fined by the fcc including viacom and cbs their coowned subsidiaries mtv and infinity broadcasting and clear channel communications enforced a blacklist of jacksons singles and music videos on many radio formats and music channels worldwide  the blacklisting and denouncement of jackson was considered to be one of the saddest things in pop music over the last decade  in january 2014 former fcc chairman michael powell stated that the controversy fines and reaction to the incident were overblown and also said jackson did not deserve the harsh treatment and blacklisting she had received in the media powell also considered it unfair that timberlake did not receive the same effect and backlash that jackson had endured    in 2002 entertainment weekly reported that jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for super bowl xxxvi however the nfl ultimately decided to select u2 to headline it after a group of nfl owners and officials attended the bands concert in new york city shortly after the september 11 attacks  in september 2003 the nfl announced that jackson would be the headline performer of the super bowl xxxviii halftime show  because the event was occurring during an election year mtv decided that the shows theme would heavily focus on the networks rock the vote campaign which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote  prior to the incident jackson notably had an essential role in timberlakes personal life career and rise to fame timberlake attended jacksons rhythm nation tour as an adolescent and jacksons energetic dance routines and daring performing style made a deep impression on him  while timberlake was a member of pop group n sync jackson selected the boy band as the opening act for many dates of her blockbuster velvet rope world tour which helped promote and introduce the thenrelatively unknown group and timberlake to the public worldwide  timberlake said he was psyched and later described the experience as fulfilling   while on the tour jackson further promoted the group by performing with n sync on several dates including joining the group for a live a capella duet of stevie wonders overjoyed which a biography stated was a highlight moment for timberlake which gave justin a chance to show his family and friends how far he had come  following the tour timberlake and jackson became good friends with jackson also praising timberlake  timberlake recreated jacksons thats the way love goes video with n sync and was inspired by jacksons performing style  timberlake had frequently mentioned admiring jackson in many interviews during this time and throughout the following few years preceding the incident    when asked who he thought was the sexiest woman on the planet timberlake had said ive thought janet jackson has nothing but sex appeal so id probably say her  timberlake later asked jackson to sing backing vocals on and she said take me now a song from his debut solo album justified which was initially planned to be released as a single commenting i wrote the chorus from a girls perspective and i just thought we should get a female on the part her name was the first that popped up in my head just because i love her voice it sounds like feathers i mean she sounds like an angel  during the halftime show jackson performed a medley of hits beginning with all for you rhythm nation and a brief excerpt of the knowledge before surprise guest timberlake appeared to perform a duet version of timberlakes song rock your body   the performance featured several suggestive dance moves by both singers and as timberlake reached his final line of rock your body im gonna have you naked by the end of this song timberlake pulled off a part of jacksons costume revealing her right breast partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry for less than a second in the immediate aftermath of the incident the cbs broadcast cut to an aerial view of reliant stadium the host venue for super bowl xxxviii but was unable to do so before the picture was sent to the television sets of an estimated 143 million viewers the incident has been referred to as nipplegate and the boob seen round the world in the media  the notorious incident led to a fivesecond broadcast delay being implemented for all future performances on live television to ensure that any potentially indecent material is not broadcast in full and an ongoing protracted legal battle over fcc censorship which lasted until 2012 and nearly went to the supreme court  jacksons publicist stated the performance ending was only supposed to reveal jacksons red lace bra though the lace undergarment was accidentally removed along with the outer layer   the fccs case to reinstate the governments fine of us550000 was refused in june 2012 chief justice john roberts said it is now clear that the brevity of an indecent broadcast  be it word or image  cannot immunize it from fcc censureany future wardrobe malfunctions will not be protected on the ground relied on by the court below  its truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million 140 million people saw my breast and then to see it blown up on the internet the size of a computer screen  but there are much worse things in the world and for this to be such a focus i dont understand mtv stated the tearing of janet jacksons costume was unrehearsed unplanned completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance mtv regrets this incident occurred and we apologize to anyone who was offended by it  the network also said our goal with the super bowl halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting we are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident  a statement from cbs read we attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen the moment did not conform to cbs broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended  viacom president mel karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99 of what people saw on the broadcast it understands what a difference one percent can make nfl commissioner paul tagliabue said the show produced by mtv which like cbs was owned by viacom at the time before the two networks were respectively separated into viacom and cbs corporation both controlled by national amusements in december 2005 fell far short of the tasteful firstclass entertainment the league expected fcc commissioner michael powell appearing before a senate panel called the super bowl incident a new low for prime time television   joe browne executive vice president of the nfl said we were extremely disappointed by elements of the mtvproduced halftime show they were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show its unlikely that mtv will produce another super bowl halftime  an hourlong mtv documentary titled making the super bowl halftime show was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently   salli frattini the executive producer for mtv who had planned the entire performance recalled a phone call from the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong frattini was in a truck outside of reliant stadium celebrating the end of 12minute halftime performance which they initially thought was a success we were like uh were playing that back right now frattini said there was lots of chaos in the truck and we played it back and we were like oh shit what just happened alex coletti another mtv producer said he could not find jackson after the performance i tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay he said her entire camp stopped answering the phones i finally got to her tour manager and they were already at the airport coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately though later assumed the incident was a possible set up adding it was the last time he had spoken to her colettis assumption is potentially another reason for jacksons blacklisting on mtv in addition to other music channels and radio formats  an mtv representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the mtv staff in which the shows producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to timberlakes closing lyric during rehearsals this led to jackson and timberlake improvising the move in which timberlake tore off jacksons kilt which was decided to look unappealing frattini stated when we did the original rehearsal there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear and that justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt in rehearsal they actually tried to rip open the skirt which kind of went with the lyrics of the song  the production team then discussed another option which led to the costume tearing although the outfit was intended to stay in place  jacksons representative explained the incident saying justin was supposed to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra the garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed  cbs forced jackson to release a video apology and said my decision to change the super bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal mtv cbs and the nfl had no knowledge of this whatsoever and unfortunately the whole thing went wrong in the end i am really sorry if i offended anyone that was truly not my intention jackson later commented sometimes they cut out that i said it was an accident when the statement was replayed in the media  a written statement read the decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals mtv was completely unaware of it it was not my intention that it go as far as it did i apologize to anyone offended  including the audience mtv cbs and the nfl  due to the event being accidental and unintentional jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this speaking to usa today jackson said its truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million 140 million people saw my breast and then to see it blown up on the internet the size of a computer screen  but there are much worse things in the world and for this to be such a focus i dont understand  regarding continued backlash she responded who knowsmaybe theyll get mad at something that i do in my show but at least it wont be new to me since ive already gone through all of this but i feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine everything happens for a reason  publicist marvet britto stated jackson embodies grace style and integrityshe has never been known as a bad person britto describes jacksons videotaped apology as impersonal saying she has never been an impersonal artist so it made it seem like she was guilty of something and she wasnt i would have had her and timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning since they performed side by side otherwise it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived jackson said of the apology i probably should have done it live but there was so much going on at the time that i needed to just get it done it is what it is and it will pass and im fine with it  at one point jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by diane sawyer on the abc newsmagazine primetime however the interview never came to fruition  jackson later briefly discussed the incident on good morning america and the late show with david letterman jacksons outfit was designed by famed designer alexander mcqueen with jackson later commenting i dont blame him he didnt rip it alexander is so great at what he does  hes a genius  in an interview with australias herald sun jackson commented on timberlake whom as mentioned jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group n sync to open for her velvet rope world tour at the start of their career   distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame i really want to be honest about this but i just feel that anything i say about him will be taken the wrong way said jackson i do think that justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him but he seems to have changed recently hes gotten a bit cocky you know some people can handle success and some people cant im starting to wonder if the latter is the case with justin and it hurts me to say that  producer jimmy jam revealed jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her damita jo album saying i dont know whether it will or not but i have a feeling it probably will because kind of whatevers happening in her life tends to be what she writes about  itd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it  the furor is hypocritical with everything you see on tv there are more important thing to focus on than a womans body part which is a beautiful thing theres war famine homelessness aids  they needed something to focus on instead of the war and i was the perfect vehicle for that  people are going to think what they want it was an accident it was not a stunt that was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast michael musto of the village voice commented on the medias reaction to the incident saying janet became a symbolic joan of arc to burn at the stake i actually do think her breast was used as a diversionary tactic  im not sure to distract from iraq specifically  but it did distract from important issues from things we actually should be appalled by the story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone  speaking to robert tannenbaum of blender magazine jackson had strong if guarded views on the reactions saying the furor is hypocritical with everything you see on tv there are more important thing to focus on than a womans body part which is a beautiful thing theres war famine homelessness aids the fact that it happened in an election year did have a great deal to do with it they needed something to focus on instead of the war and i was the perfect vehicle for that people are going to think what they want it was an accident it was not a stunt that was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast thats like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people  janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as contradictory noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and viagra are both very sexual and practically omnipresent  jackson also said the mishap was not intentional and a costume accident also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology saying sometimes they cut out that i said it was an accidentthats what the media does thats the way they are because they want it to be told a different way  in glamour magazine janet exclaimed its hard to believe that theres a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast people said that it was done intentionally to sell records do you know what i have never pulled a stunt why would you do that and have your album come out two months later it doesnt make sense in the ensuing months janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her people think im immune to being hurt by whats said they ask me questions that shock me not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill people push you and you start to think can i handle this but i know i can  immediately following the incident timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions telling access hollywood hey man we love giving you all something to talk about  timberlake released a statement saying i am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the super bowl it was not intentional and is regrettable  however timberlake was not required to film a video apology as jackson was timberlake also addressed the incident at the grammy awards the following week which jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter saying i know its been a rough week on everybody what occurred was unintentional completely regrettable and i apologize if you guys are offended  timberlake gave an additional interview at the grammy event and stated all i could say was oh my god oh my god timberlake said i looked at her they brought a towel up on stage they covered her up i was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as i could im frustrated at the whole situation im frustrated that my character is being questioned and the fact of the matter is you know ive had a good year a really good year especially with my music  timberlake later declared it was something that went wrong then i felt like im going to show everyone that this was something that didnt affect me and im going to show up at the grammys  he later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in spain having only one day to rehearse  while promoting his sophomore album futuresexlovesounds over two years later timberlake expressed regret for his behavior saying in my honest opinion now  i couldve handled it better justin admits im part of a community that consider themselves artists and if there was something i could have done in her defense that was more than i realized then i would have but the other half of me was like wow we still havent found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this in retrospect timberlake thinks he should have been held more responsible i probably got 10 percent of the blame and that says something about society he explains i think that americas harsher on women and i think that america is you know unfairly harsh on ethnic people   when asked to comment in retrospect a decade after the incident timberlake stated i take that i chose not to comment on it still after 10 years im not touching that thing with a 10foot pole  timberlakes character was called into question following the performance and he received a large amount of criticism after distancing himself from the controversy and leaving jackson to take the blame for the incident  jackson suspected ulterior motives in the medias reaction expressing it was just perfect timing to take peoples focus off of other things thats what happens and it happened to me  accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise michael rich director of harvards center on media and child health exclaimed here we have michael powell upset about the happening in the super bowl but the same powell has been unwilling to do anything about the violence on television where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids robert thompson founding director of the center for the study of popular television at syracuse university said michael powell is representing the super bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties or like its the macys day parade  come on theres gambling theres a lot of drinking partying a carnival atmosphere he asserted jay rosenthal attorney for the recording artists coalition says the fccs involvement was a smokescreen or a sound bite attempt by the republicanled commission to act as if its doing something when it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists they dont care about that but when it comes to indecency after ignoring it for years all of a sudden theyre snapping to attention he said simon renshaw of management group the firm stated it to be inappropriate that powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of whats currently going on in the media what i find offensive is cbs refusal to carry moveonorgs ad during the super bowl which pictured children working in factories to pay off the bush administrations budget deficit  the boston legal episode let sales ring likened the incident to being used as a distraction portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media  daniel kreps of rolling stone explained for the fcc nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left faced with lax broadcast standards for cable tv and satellite radio as well as the absolute lawlessness of the internet the fcc becomes hellbent on preserving common decency in the familyfriendly realm of network television thus screws are tightened everywhere under the bodys jurisdiction tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections while the aftermath of nipplegate starts to fade the fcc will continue to carry its torch for the next halfdecade  cynthia fuchs of popmatters stated it behooves tv producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant news rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians performers professional spinners and journalists janet is not that person you watch on tv and neither is anyone else  a decade after the incident former fcc chairman michael powell gave his first interview regarding jacksons performance saying jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy including his own reaction was completely overblown powell stated i think weve been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that i had to put my best version of outrage on that i could put on part of it was surreal right look i think it was dumb to happen and they knew the rules and were flirting with them and my job is to enforce the rules but you know really this is what were gonna do powell also said the treatment of jackson who was lambasted for causing an outrageous stunt was unfair and commented on timberlake not receiving the same backlash i personally thought that was really unfair he said it all turned into being about her in reality if you slow the thing down its justin ripping off her breastplate  in the united states the exposure of jacksons nipple by timberlake led to much media controversy and headlines in which it was sometimes referred to as nipplegate   the socially conservative media watchdog group parents television council ptc issued a statement that same day condemning the halftime show announcing that their members would file indecency complaints with the fcc and the council supported the commissions decision to investigate the halftime show immediately  in addition the fcc received nearly 540000 complaints from americans  with the ptc claiming responsibility for around 65000 of them  in its appeal to the third circuit court cbs disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual nonorganized viewers  columnists l brent bozell iii  who also founded the parents television council and phyllis schlafly  also expressed criticism of the halftime show in their weekly columns democratic senator zell miller of georgia both on the floor of the united states senate  and in an editorial on saloncom  denounced the halftime show as what he perceived as declining morality in america the day immediately following the super bowl thenfcc chairman michael powell ordered an investigation into the halftime show  timberlake told cbs ownedandoperated station kcbstv in los angeles a few days following the super bowl that even his own family was offended by the mishap at the end of the halftime show  however an associated press poll taken nearly three weeks after the super bowl found that although 54 of american adults considered the exposure distasteful only 18 supported the fccs investigation  film director spike lee speaking at kent state university at stark on february 3 called the incident a new low in entertainment  the super bowl controversy was also a subject of humor on all of the latenight talk shows for example cbss own late show with david letterman mocked the incident all week following the super bowl host david letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the super bowl that he was happy to see this thing happen because that meant for one night i wasnt the biggest boob on cbs  the next day he also joked that president george w bush formed a department of wardrobe security to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions  on february 4 letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction  additionally the top ten lists featured on the program on that same night  briefly referenced the incident jacksons appearance on the late show the following month increased the shows ratings 20 from the programs usual weeknight opener  larry king also stated jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples commenting i wore them once they were cute  democratic presidential candidate howard dean called the fccs investigation silly commenting in general i think the fcc does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency however considering whats on television these days i think the fcc is being pretty silly about investigating this dean added i dont find it terribly shocking relative to some of the things you can find on standard cable television i think the fcc probably has a lot of other things they should be pursuing  south park aired on comedy central a sister network to cbs at the time and to mtv through viacom took aim at the hysteria in its eighth season premiere good times with weapons on march 17 of that year when eric cartman sneaks across a stage in the nude and later blames the incident on a wardrobe malfunction the townspeople are angered by cartmans display rather than feeling concern for a badly injured and disoriented character butters who is also present on stage  a reference to the american cultures acceptance of violence while maintaining a taboo against nudity  during the 2004 mtv video music awards comedian dave chappelle joked that his appearance on the vmas was the biggest mistake mtv made since they put janet jackson on the super bowl  family guy also did an episode based around the wardrobe malfunction and the fccs crackdown on indecent content with one scene parodying the incident directly  the fourth season episode ptv involved actor david hyde pierce having a trouser malfunction at the emmys the fccs sudden crackdown on indecent material on television leads an angered peter griffin to start his own network with looser content standards ptv on which later in the same episode he presents a show called the side boob hour which among other risque programs he puts on leads his objected wife lois to call the fcc to crack down on ptv leading to the implication of the fcc also regulating what his family says and does the halftime show continued to be a subject of discussion in 2005 at the beginning of 2005 the parody newspaper the onion ran as its headline article for january 26 2005 us children still traumatized one year after seeing partially exposed breast on tv the articles satirical target was the nations reaction to the incident rather than the incident itself  on february 1 2005 exactly one year after the halftime show the ptc released a report titled mtv smut peddlers targeting kids with sex drugs and alcohol covering mtv programming during the networks spring break week from march 20 to 27 2004 accusing mtv of irresponsibly promoting sex drugs and alcohol to impressionable youth in response to the report mtv network executive jeannie kedas argued that the report underestimates young peoples intellect and their level of sophistication  on february 6 however new york times columnist frank rich argued that censorship on television was becoming more prevalent following the halftime show in his february 6 2005 column the year of living indecently examples he cited included more than 60 abcaffiliated stations including those owned by the e w scripps company hearstargyle television and cox broadcasting refusing to broadcast saving private ryan due to the profanity prevalent throughout the film which was to be aired unedited in its entirety by the network and pbs editing obscene language out of certain programs such as the british terrorist drama dirty war  the espn series playmakers was also immediately forced to be canceled by the nfl following the incident   an ad from budweiser which depicted a man opening a beverage on the outfits breastplate and tearing it before it was worn was intended to be aired during super bowl xxxix the following year but was pulled before its broadcast   in canada where the super bowl telecast was broadcast by the global television network the incident passed largely without controversy only about 50 canadians complained about the incident to the canadian broadcast standards council cbsc  the cbsc received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the super bowl broadcast including music and advertising issues though some were expected complaints about canadian contentsimsub issues preventing viewing of the popular american ads which is a common issue among canadian viewers of the super bowl to the present day  professor robert thompson director of the center for the study of popular television at syracuse university stated i know many people in other countries are scratching their heads and thinking what in the world is the big fuss over there  new zealand news outlets rebroadcast the nipplegate moment some in slow motion with commentary explaining that american ultraconservatives had made the incident into a major controversy the nations largest newspaper the new zealand herald ran an oped from a new zealander living in the us detailing his bafflement at his american friends who had expressed outrage at the glimpse of nipple while supporting their countrys invasion of iraq and being fans of the television show sex and the city  on february 4 terri carlin a banker residing in knoxville tennessee filed a class action lawsuit against jackson and timberlake on behalf of all american citizens who watched the outrageous conduct the lawsuit alleged that the halftime show contained sexually explicit acts solely designed to garner publicity and ultimately to increase profits for themselves the lawsuit sought maximum punitive and compensatory damages from the performers carlin later dropped the lawsuit  three months later eric stephenson a lawyer from farmington utah filed a us5000 lawsuit in smallclaims court against viacom for false advertising of the super bowl halftime show as he the father of three young children claimed that pregame advertising led him to believe that the halftime show would consist of marching bands balloons and a patriotic celebration  the lawsuit was rejected because stephenson should have filed a federal lawsuit or complaint to the fcc which was already investigating the halftime show  america online the internet service provider that sponsored the halftime show demanded a refund of the approximately us75 million that it paid to sponsor and advertise on the halftime show however no other advertisers of the super bowl had similar demands  the incident triggered a rash of fines that the fcc levied soon after the super bowl alleging that the context of the wardrobe malfunction was intended to pander titillate and shock those watching because it happened within the lyrics within timberlakes performance of rock your body hurry up cause youre taking too long better have you naked by the end of this song  in addition the fcc cited a news article on mtvs website mtvcom claiming that the halftime show would promise shocking moments  and that officials of both cbs and mtv were well aware of the overall sexual nature of the jacksontimberlake segment and fully sanctioned it  indeed touted it as shocking to attract potential viewers  cbs however argued that the exposure was unplanned  although in later statements cbs asserted that while the exposure was unplanned by cbs it was deliberately planned by timberlake and jackson independently and clandestinely  on september 22 2004 the fcc fined viacom the maximum penalty of us27500 for each of the 20 cbsowned television stations including satellites of wfrv in green bay wcco in minneapolis and kutv in salt lake city current cbs ownedandoperated station kovr in sacramento at the time was owned by the sinclair broadcast group for a fine totaling us550000 the largest ever placed against a television broadcaster at that time   however the parents television council  and even some of the fcc commissioners  criticized the commission for fining only 20 cbs stations not all of them for the halftime show 66 of respondents to a march 2005 time magazine poll believed that the fcc overreacted to the halftime show by fining cbs  on november 24 2004 viacom paid out us35 million to settle outstanding indecency complaints and stated that it would challenge the us550000 penalty related to the incident on the grounds that the broadcast was unintentional and thus exempt from indecency regulation  in march 2006 the fcc affirmed that the super bowl halftime show was indecent  so cbs paid the fccs issued fine in july 2006 in order to take their appeal against their fine to federal court  cbs appealed the fine on september 17 at the us third circuit court of appeals in philadelphia  on july 21 2008 the third circuit court of appeals ruled  in favor of cbs voiding the fccs fine on the grounds that the enforcement involved a significant deviation from prior practice that was not announced as a clear policy change    on may 4 2009 however the supreme court vacated and remanded the case back to the third circuit for reconsideration in light of the previously decided federal communications commission v fox television stations 2009   on november 2 2011 the third circuit court ruled 21 that its earlier decision was correct citing that the broadcast was legal under the fccs thencurrent policy of allowing fleeting indecency on the airwaves and that it was unfair of the fcc to change the policy retroactively   on june 29 2012 the supreme court declined an fcc appeal  prior to the broadcast cbs rejected the moveonorg super bowl ad bush in 30 seconds because it was deemed too controversial cbs stated that it had a decadesold policy of rejecting ads regarding controversial issues of public importance although moveon charged that the networks had previously accepted similar ads from other groups  the super bowl broadcast featured numerous commercials for erectile dysfunction medicines and advertisements for anheuserbuschs bud light brand featuring a flatulating horse and a dog attacking male genitalia however no politically charged ads appeared during the telecast  cbs which also held the rights to super bowl xliv later aired a commercial during that game featuring thenflorida gators quarterback tim tebow and his mother that discreetly refer to their prolife viewpoints the ad sponsored by focus on the family received similar controversy   in a leaguemandated policy meant to clear the airwaves of such advertisements the nfl announced that those types of commercials would not air again during super bowl broadcasts the league ended an advertising relationship with levitra in march 2007 as an official league sponsor  in january 2005 fox the network that carried super bowl xxxix under the nfls alternating network contract for the championship game rejected an advertisement for the cold remedy airborne that briefly featured the naked buttocks of veteran actor mickey rooney  moments after the jacksontimberlake tangle streaker mark roberts added to the controversial halftime by running around the field naked except for some writing on his body which read super bowel on the front an advertisement for an online betting website and a wellplaced gstring attached to half of a miniature football covering roberts genitals  part of roberts stunt was broadcast in the united states cbs chose to keep its cameras in a wideshot view of the stadium and use quick cutaways to players and coaches as roberts ran around the field until players from both competing teams the new england patriots and the carolina panthers tackled him matt chatham the patriots special teams expert and reserve linebacker initially knocked roberts down thus allowing stadium security and police to arrest roberts and take him into custody  roberts returned on october 28 2007 when the nfl staged the first regular season game played outside north america before the second half of the new york giantsmiami dolphins contest at wembley stadium in london in what he dubbed super bowel returns he streaked again  aside from jacksons exposure minor controversy around the shows other performances included rappers p diddy and nelly gesturing towards their crotches stripping cheerleaders and musician kid rock appearing in a poncho made from a slit american flag which he later threw towards the audience   us senator zell miller complained that kid rocks outfit was a desecration of the american flag  website soap opera central speculated that the fallout from this incident may have had a subtle effect on daytime television these television shows are known for love in the afternoon and regularly feature romantic couplings shortly before the super bowl the procter  gamble soap operas as the world turns and guiding light had gone as far as featuring rear male nudity during sexual scenes after the super bowl controversy fcc commissioner michael j copps stated that it was time for a crackdown on inappropriate sexual content in daytime television and indicated that he was reviewing whether soap operas were violating the agencys indecency prohibitions  two other major sporting events that followed the super bowl that year also were forced to clean up their respective halftime shows following the incident the pro bowl which would be played on february 8 at aloha stadium in hawaii originally was to feature singer jc chasez who was a member of boy band n sync as was timberlake sing the national anthem before the game and perform his hit song blowin me up with her love at halftime however the nfl did not allow chasez to perform during halftime due to the sexually suggestive content of his chosen song even though the game was carried by espn which is not under the content purview of the fcc as it is a cable network and therefore only selfregulates content as an advertisersupported service replacing it with traditional hawai\u02bbian dancers   the 2004 nba allstar game also cleaned up its act despite being broadcast on tnt which in reiteration is not bound by fcc content regulations as a cable network having halftime performer beyoncé knowles perform crazy in love rather than naughty girl which they feared would incite controversy given its sexual content jackson was in attendance at the game and dressed conservatively  the networks that were to broadcast the 46th grammy awards cbs and the 76th academy awards abc live events scheduled for february 8 and february 29 respectively enhanced their broadcast delays to accommodate editing of inappropriate video in addition to audio   following these announcements guiding light edited out nudity from an episode that had already been taped a week later the shows executive producer john conboy was fired and replaced by ellen wheeler all nine american network soaps began to impose an unwritten rule of avoiding any sort of risqué adult scenes and in the months following editors of soap opera periodical soap opera digest wrote about how daytime television was losing its steam  nbc also reedited a scene from an episode of its medical drama er where paramedics were wheeling an elderly woman into the hospital and her breast could be seen nonexplicitly in the context of her injury and treatment  even as late as veterans day november 11 of 2004 65 abcaffiliated stations preempted the uncut network presentation of the film saving private ryan over concerns about the films violent and profane content and fcc regulations benjamin svetkey of entertainment weekly quoted l brent bozell iii and peggy noonan associating the mass preemption of ryan with the halftime show incident  the annual victorias secret fashion show was cancelled for that year in reaction to the incident  clear channel communications owner of many popular radio stations and affiliated with super bowl broadcaster cbs had also censored or removed many songs from radio following the event including blacklisting jackson from receiving airplay as well as focusing on editing rock radio formats in particular rolling stone stated stations all over the country the petition notes are dropping or editing dozens of songs including the whos who are you lou reeds walk on the wild side pearl jams jeremy and john mellencamps jack and diane according to the petition a clear channel programmer combed through the song database for five denver stations and made changes to everything from steve millers jet airliner to nine inch nails closer cleveland classicrock station wncx 985 has yanked warren zevons lawyers guns and money pink floyds money and several other classics its absurd says reed its like being censored by a squirrel its beneath me its beneath all these artists its done by people who are very pious and stupid  clear channel communications also removed talkradio host howard stern from several of its largemarket radio stations within a month of the incident citing the raunchy content of sterns show the fcc fined clear channel over allegedly indecent content on the bubba the love sponge radio show  as a result of the incident some networks established regulations requiring time delays of as much as five minutes for live broadcasts such as awards shows and sporting events  in late 2004 the united states house of representatives passed a bill to raise the maximum fcc fine penalty from said us27500 to us500000 per violation the united states senate voted to decrease it to us275000 per incident with a cap of us3 million per day  by june 2006 the two houses reconciled the differences in fine levels settling for a fine of us325000 per violation in the broadcast decency enforcement act of 2005  the incident also prompted tighter control over content by station owners and managers viacom at the center of the controversy also employed the controversial howard stern in its radio division at the time called infinity broadcasting the expanding control on content is said to be a contributing factor that drove stern away from terrestrial radio and onto sirius satellite radio and is sometimes credited as the media figure most responsible for introducing a new era in radio  it has also been reported that some teenoriented awards shows in the summer of 2004 had also been purged of most sexual and profane content that had been perceived as staples in such awards telecasts in the past including foxs teen choice awards and mtvs selfcreated video music awards  author frederick s lane stated in an interview with john eggerton of broadcasting  cable magazine that the controversy surrounding the halftime show was the primary inspiration for his 2006 book the decency wars the campaign to cleanse american culture which explains moral controversies in the american media over the years  the super bowl itself would not feature a modern act for its halftime show for the next six years opting instead for classic rockers such as paul mccartney the rolling stones prince tom petty and the heartbreakers bruce springsteen and the e street band and the who mccartney the stones and the who were all part of the british invasion of the 1960s in fact no women performed at the super bowl halftime show at all until the black eyed peas performed in 2011 in 2012 during the halftime show for super bowl xlvi rapper mia pointed up her middle finger during her performance that incident drew comparisons with the exposure of janet jacksons breast in the super bowl halftime show eight years prior the associated press asserted that people learned what mia did only when reports surfaced in the media and quoted tv critic james poniewozik i had no idea she even did it until nbc issued an apology for it  nbc blurred the entire screen albeit a second too late to obscure mia giving the finger  the nfl ultimately sued mia for us15 million on breach of contract grounds  which mia is currently defending in court as an indication of the reduced level of complaints only 222 complaints were filed over the incident  sports would be greatly affected by the controversy three weeks later nascar announced at the driver and crew chief meeting at north carolina speedway that it would stiffen penalties on use of improper language or gestures including larger fines loss of points if it occurred in a postrace interview or after the driver fell out of a race ejection of a team from the race or lap penalties if inrace under the circuits detrimental to nascar rule  johnny sauter was fined us10000 and 25 points a week after the new rule took in effect for obscene language in an interview later in 2004 dale earnhardt jr received a 25point penalty and a us50000 fine when he used an obscenity after winning the 2004 ea sports 500 at talladega superspeedway he lost the championship lead after that incident and lost the championship by 100 points after the incident in 2007 tony stewart received a similar penalty after using an obscenity in a postrace interview following his brickyard 400 win kyle busch in november 2010 was fined us25000 for an obscene gesture caught on espn along with an inrace twolap penalty as the gesture was aimed at a nascar official the nfl also came under some smaller controversies over its telecasts the fcc received a complaint about foxs telecast of a january 2005 playoff game between the green bay packers and minnesota vikings the complainant alleged that minnesota player randy moss who scored a touchdown apparently made movements appearing to moon the spectators however the fcc denied the complaint because moss was fully clothed at all times and his gestures were shown for only a few seconds thus warranting that the display was not indecent game announcer joe buck also immediately condemned the act and additionally moss was fined by the nfl  on january 13 2007 during foxs coverage of an nfl playoff game between the new orleans saints and philadelphia eagles the camera cut to the stands showing for four seconds a shirt with the words fuck da eagles that was worn by a female spectator that drew a backlash from the parents television council which filed complaints with the fcc  during nbcs live broadcast of super bowl xliii on february 1 2009 the fiveyear anniversary of the original incident affiliate kvoatvs analog broadcast feed the high definition feed of the station was unaffected over comcasts tucson arizona system was interrupted by an unknown party when an excerpt of a film aired by adult cable channel shorteez was broadcast for 30 seconds to local comcast subscribers just after larry fitzgerald scored his fourthquarter touchdown to take the cardinals to a 2320 lead afterwards 10 seconds of an end credit segment from clubjenna which like shorteez is owned by playboy enterprises was shown  comcast offered a us10 credit for customers who claimed to have seen the incident  and the federal communications commission announced that it would investigate the cause of the incident e online columnist josh grossberg stated this almost makes us nostalgic for the days of nipplegate  frederick s lane argued in his 2006 book the decency wars that the super bowl halftime show controversy influenced the primary focus on moral values and media decency in the 2004 democratic party primaries  jackson claimed the incident was used in the media as a diversion for president george w bushs poor approval ratings and the iraq war with bush and first lady laura bush giving public commentary on the incident rather than focusing on other issues  we are absolutely bailing on the record  the pressure is so great they cant align with anything related to janet the highups are still pissed at her and this is a punitive measure  radio wouldnt play it and mtv wouldnt play her videos for i want you and all nite two songs that wouldve been outofthepark hits at any other point in jacksons career various entertainment companies including viacom which owns mtv and infinity broadcasting as well as at the time cbs which owned clear channel communications enforced a blacklist of jacksons singles and music videos on many music channels and radio stations worldwide as a result of the incident which largely affected her chart performance throughout the course of her eighth studio album damita jo released the same year as well as her following two albums 20 yo and discipline     jackson was intended to appear at the 46th annual grammy awards which was being held the following week but her invitation was withdrawn due to the incident jackson was originally scheduled to appear as a presenter for a tribute to luther vandross performed by celine dion richard marx and alicia keys and was chosen due to previously collaborating with vandross on the 1 hit the best things in life are free according to people magazine jackson had been slated to speak before the accolade but was being pressured to bow out gracefully  or face being uninvited before later being completely barred from attending however timberlake was still allowed to attend and perform at the event   the majority of the artists at the ceremony were also asked to comment on jacksons incident  jackson had also been cast to play lena horne in a movie about the singer and activists life which was to be produced by abc but was forced to resign following the performance incident  a statue of mickey mouse wearing jacksons iconic rhythm nation outfit was mantled at walt disney world theme park the previous year to honor jacksons legacy but was removed following jacksons controversial performance a spokesman for disney said considering all the controversy the performance drew we talked it over for a couple of days and decided it would be best to replace hers with a new one entertainment weekly objected the decision arguing theyre still letting donald duck walk around without pants  in her first interview since the incident jackson appeared on cbss late show with david letterman on march 29 2004 which increased the shows ratings over 20  in april 2004 jackson poked fun at herself in an appearance on saturday night live first while playing condoleezza rice in a skit nervously answering a question by exposing her right breast which was pixelated by nbc and again by viewing a mock home video from her childhood in which her bathing suit top came off in a wading pool calling it a swimsuit malfunction   an nbc spokesman said jackson was wearing a bra beneath her blouse during the skit  during a performance on abcs good morning america the network promoted jacksons appearance as her first live performance since the super bowl hinting at the chance of shock value blender magazine recalled photographers and camera crews are packed in in case jackson decides to show us the left one and if all eyes and cameras are on her chest jackson 38 responds defiantly by refusing to cloak her breasts in a modest turtleneck the cleavage is her way of saying fuck you  in 2006 during an interview on the oprah winfrey show jackson upheld her claim that the super bowl scandal was an accident  janet jacksons first album released following the super bowl incident was damita jo her eighth studio album a majority of the reviews for the album including those by allmusic the bbc entertainment weekly the guardian and the new york times focused on the negative backlash suffered by jackson as a result of the incident but gave favorable reviews to the album itself    blender magazine considered the albums success to be a minorchord fyou victory to the wolves nipping at janets tits  despite the blacklisting damita jo was a success and certified platinum selling over three million copies worldwide and also receiving a grammy nomination the albums lead single just a little while peaked at 1 in japan and the albums second single i want you was also certified platinum the albums third single all nite dont stop was called one of the biggest records this year in several different scenes despite the airplay boycott attributing its success to embracing the best elements of mainstream pop music and not simply dismissing the entire medium as creatively barren  both just a little while and all nite dont stop also reached 1 on the hot dance club songs chart although receiving positive reception the incident also affected the performance of following albums 20 yo and discipline due to the blacklist however 20 yo managed to sell over 15 million copies worldwide certified platinum and receiving a grammy nomination call on me a duet with nelly peaked at 1 on the billboard hot rb songs chart and also became a top five hit in europe and other territories   additionally feedback reached the top 20 pop hit on the billboard hot 100 selling one million copies worldwide subsequent releases make me peaked atop the hot dance club songs and top 20 internationally nothing reached 1 on the digital pop and music video charts also considered for an oscar nomination  immediately following the incident timberlake jokingly dismissed it telling the inquisitive press jackson and i love giving you all something to talk about  his attitude quickly changed as the scandal grew into a serious controversy people magazine stated timberlake was referred to as the teflon man at the 46th annual grammy awards because the incident did not affect him as it did with jackson  in a 2006 interview with mtv timberlake said that compared to the huge backlash jackson suffered he himself received only about 10 of the blame and he accused american society of being both harsher on women and unfairly harsh on ethnic people  prior to plans for the super bowl performance jackson and timberlake had discussed potentially recording a duet for jacksons damita jo album as well as a rumored collaboration for a quincy jones album though neither came to fruition   in november 2013 timberlake performed a cover of jacksons lets wait awhile on the 2020 experience world tour before transitioning into his song until the end of time which was regarded as a sign of affection or apology to jackson  media commentators stated jackson was treated too harshly by the media and public while timberlakes career was not affected much by the incident shannon l holland in womens studies in communication argued that the media reaction after the incident focused disproportionately on jackson representing her as a contemporary jezebel in that her racial and gendered otherness was often juxtaposed with the normalcy of timberlakes white masculinity that is she emerged in a public discourse as the primary if not sole instigator of the lewd act a scheming seductress who manipulated timberlake for her own economic gain  in 2014 former fcc chairman michael powell who had enforced fines on the conglomerates involved with the broadcast following the incident stated i personally thought that was really unfair it all turned into being about her in reality if you slow the thing down its justin ripping off her breastplate  rob sheffield of rolling stone stated justin isnt exactly mr loyalty  he totally left janet jackson to take the heat after the super bowl  e online also commented timberlake wasted no time placing the bulk of the blame for the incident on jackson and of course the woman takes the blame even though the man stripped her pathetically typical   a reporter for vh1 said jt still gets a side eye for leaving her out to dry  one observer claimed despite her wardrobe malfunction  for which we think justin timberlake wasnt punished nearly as severely for  janet put on a pretty amazing show  the new york times noted after her right breast upstaged the super bowl she was criticized by the first lady vilified by media executives and abandoned by her coconspirator justin timberlake less excitable commentators suggested she was merely a shrewd publicitystunt woman with a new album to promote  jacksons parents joe and katherine jackson also expressed concern that timberlake did not stand by janet following the incident commenting what i didnt like is there wasnt one person on that stage there were two people after a while there was only janet jackson thats all there was janet jackson adding janet dont pull that thing open herself he did it we were surprised that they didnt say anything to justin about it  an anecdote from la weekly provided a scathing attack on timberlakes character regarding the aftermath of the incident saying meanwhile jacksons super bowl accomplice young master timberlake has proven himself to be the bitchmadepopstar you always knew he was as though aiming to get his own chapter in greg tates book everything but the burden what white people are taking from black culture timberlake shed all wigger affectations the moment he felt the heat of real controversy he dropped the hiphop gear grabbed a suit and tie and literally held his mommys hand as he strolled into this years grammy awards where he all but burst into tears as he apologetically explained onstage how hed been bamboozled into taking part in janets shameful shenanigans poor thing  pop singer katy perry parodied jacksons super bowl incident in the music video for her single last friday night tgif during a scene where perrys breast is accidentally exposed at a school event   jacksons incident is also recreated in eminems ass like that music video the controversy and sexual nature surrounding miley cyrus performance of we cant stop and blurred linesgive it 2 u with guest artist robin thicke at the 2013 mtv video music awards was likened to jacksons performance with timberlake at the super bowl event  the term wardrobe malfunction which was developed to describe jacksons incident in a public statement and was later added to the merriamwebsters collegiate dictionary has influenced media by frequently being used by various entertainers and publications when describing revealing outfits or more so accidental public exposures or nudity the terms frequent usage following the incident has led to numerous entertainment outlets compiling various celebrity wardrobe malfunctions with jackson included in the lists as the most infamous example and originator of the term   several songs have mentioned jacksons performance most notably drake in birdmans money to blow and eminems ass like that as well as drakes zone tygas tyga montana 50 cents just a touch kanye west in mases be alright welcome back remix tech n9nes pornographic and flash tpains therapy chamillionaires talking that talk and common in jadakisss

referenced the incident when ripping off part of kristen wiigs outfit during an appearance on saturday night live in 2009  the family guy episode ptv was written as a parody of the fccs strict measures and regulations following jacksons super bowl halftime show performance controversy  a scene from the episode involving the fictional portrayal of an extreme reaction to actor david hyde pierce having a wardrobe malfunction at the emmy awards was also a recreation and reference to the incident  jacksons performance is again referenced in a brief scene where peter griffin is dressed in jacksons super bowl outfit and has his breast exposed by justin timberlake during the musical number the freaking fcc  the episode received primetime emmy award and annie award nominations for its subject matter jacksons performance also inspired the south park episode good times with weapons in the episode the shows creators draw attention to the media and publics unnecessary reaction to jacksons brief exposure while disregarding or accepting extreme acts of violence during a scene where the public is outraged when eric cartman is seen naked and having a wardrobe malfunction on stage while character butters stotch is ignored although he is bleeding and severely injured several game shows have also mentioned jacksons performance several presenters at award shows have referenced the incident including anna nicole smith at the first annual mtv australia video music awards dave chappelle at the mtv video music awards and singer alanis morissette at the juno awards commenting its disturbing and curious to me to see what came of that were all sexual beings and if we dont let it out organically we repress ourselves if we repress anger it turns to depression if we repress our sexuality it turns to pornography and rape to think that the country was in an uproar because of a nipple   comedian russell brand referenced the incident when hosting the 2008 mtv video music awards saying i can almost guarantee a janet jacksonstyle super bowl nip slip  the super bowl xxxviii incident is considered to be the most controversial television and media event to occur within popular culture and jackson was regarded as the worlds most controversial musician who was changing the cultural landscape due to the incidents massive effect on censorship and broadcasting in television and entertainment  the performance incident made janet jackson the most searched term event and image in internet history   jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of guinness world records as most searched in internet history and the most searched for news item  it also broke the record for most searched event over one day  janet jackson also became the most searched term and person for 2004 and also of the following year   it also set a record for being the most watched recorded and replayed moment on tivo  a company representative stated the audience measurement guys have never seen anything like it the audience reaction charts looked like an electrocardiogram  monte burke of forbes magazine reported the fleeting moment enticed an estimated 35000 new tivo subscribers to sign up  janets super bowl halftime incident also coined the phrase wardrobe malfunction which was later officially added to the websters english dictionary in 2008  in the immediate aftermath of the incident entertainment weekly stated radio stations rushed to add jacksons new single just a little while to playlists on monday following the incident  and usa today reports that jewelry stores and piercing studios are seeing increased customer interest in silver sunburstshaped nipple shields  youtube cofounder jawed karim revealed that his frustration at not being able to easily find a video clip of the incident provided the inspiration for the creation of youtube and later of vevo  the launch of facebook commenced three days following the incident in a potential attempt to capitalize on its publicity through social networking  rolling stone stated jacksons super bowl performance is far and away the most famous moment in the history of the super bowl halftime show  popcrush called the performance one of the most shocking moments in pop culture as well as a totally unexpected and unforgettable moment  gawker ranked the performance among the most recent of the 10 shows that advanced sex on television commenting the set had all the elements of a huge story and within seconds the world searched furtively for pictures concluding it remains so ubiquitous its impossible to look at a starburst nipple shield without thinking janet jackson  e online ranked it among the top ten most shocking celebrity moments of the prior two decades  a study of televisions most impactful moments of the last 50 years conducted by sony electronics and the nielsen television research company ranked jacksons super bowl performance at 26 the incident was the only super bowl event on the list and the highest music and entertainment event aside from the death of whitney houston  tv guide network ranked it at 2 in a 2010 special listing the 25 biggest tv blunders  complex stated its the citizen kane

immediately after the incident the fcc received a flood of complaints from parents who just wanted their children to enjoy a nice wholesome three hours of grown men inflicting damaging and longlasting pain on each other for sport halftime shows would never be the same  patrick gipson of bleacher report ranked it as 1 in its list of the most jaw dropping moments of the last decade stating janet

V breast enlargement supplements are frequently portrayed as being a natural means to increase breast size and with the suggestion that they are free from risk   the popularity of breast enlargement supplements stems from their heavy promotion   towards women   at times testimonials by companies have been faked   the mayo clinic advises that there may be serious drug interactions with use  there has been historical folklore about using herbs for breast enlargement     products typically contain a variety of ingredients of plant or fungal origin the compounds claimed to be pharmacologically active are typically estrogen mimics called xenoestrogens specifically known as phytoestrogens in plants and mycoestrogens in fungi  commonly used ingredients include     there is inadequate scientific study whether herbal breast enlargement can be safely achieved  it is unlikely that any of the common ingredients would be efficacious    no randomized blinded and fully controlled tests has been performed to test any breast enhancement product   most supplement ingredients do not have significant adverse effects but some ingredients are potentially dangerous for consumption or use   herbal products are normally sold under generally regarded as safe gras rules and are not approved for this indication some naturally occurring compounds produced by plants and fungi can carry serious health risks one potential risk is an increased chance of breast cancer some of the ingredients included in supplements are carcinogenic including don quai   by altering the bodys hormonal levels certain ingredients including zearalenone may reduce fertility  one ingredient kava may cause liver damage   black cohosh has been shown to have no estrogenic effect in vivo or in vitro   hops contain estrogenlike compounds called prenylflavonoids of the most potent is 8prenylnaringenin  hops role on fertility lacks research   prenylflavonoids from hops have anticancer properties  zearalenone and its derivatives are a class of xenoestrogens associated with many herbal bust enhancement products  there have been some indications that zearalenone can increase the size of breasts in humans but there are no tests of efficacy or safety   zearalenone produced by a toxic fungus is a mycoestrogen that stimulates the growth of breast cancer cells increases the chance of estrogen dependent breast cancer and may reduce fertility  other supplements are unlikely to have been spoiled with the mould    indirect assay tests of the product erdic also known as bust out on the uterus of rodents by measuring the amount of estrogen present showed no difference from the control   preliminary findings in 2001 in mice suggested that hops based products would be ineffective  another test of a hops ingredient on mice showed weak effects for high dosages    diosgenin contained in fenugreek and wild yam affected maturation but that wasnt enough evidence for this indication   some medications have been involved in breast enlargement as a side effect

V the framingham heart study is a longterm ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of framingham massachusetts the study began in 1948 with 5209 adult subjects from framingham and is now on its third generation of participants  prior to it almost nothing was known about the epidemiology of hypertensive or arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease  much of the nowcommon knowledge concerning heart disease such as the effects of diet exercise and common medications such as aspirin is based on this longitudinal study it is a project of the national heart lung and blood institute in collaboration with since 1971 boston university  various health professionals from the hospitals and universities of greater boston staff the project   thomas royle dawber was director of the study from 1949 to 1966 he was appointed as chief epidemiologist shortly after the start of the project when it was not progressing well  the study had been intended to last 20 years but at that time dawber moved to boston and became chairman of preventive medicine raising funds to continue the project and taking it with him by 1968 a fight was underway to keep the framingham study going in an era marked by protests assassinations the struggle for civil rights and controversy surrounding americas military involvement with the vietnam war a committee gathered and considered that after 20 years of research the framingham study should come to an end since their hypothesis had been tested and extensive information concerning heart diseases had been gathered despite this conclusion the study continued and in 1971 it enrolled a second generation of participants  in 1994 a more diverse sampling of framingham residents was enrolled as the omni cohort in april 2002 a third generation was enrolled in the core study and a second generation of omni participants was enrolled in the following year over 1000 medical papers have been published related to the framingham heart study it is generally accepted that the work is outstanding in its scope and duration and overall is considered very useful the initial population was 5209 healthy men and women aged 30 to 62 not the whole of the town population as is sometimes assumed it was rightly assumed from the start of the framingham heart study that cardiac health can be influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors and by inheritance the framingham heart study is the origin of the term risk factor before the framingham heart study doctors had little sense of prevention in the 1950s it was believed that clogging of arteries and narrowing of arteries atherosclerosis arteriosclerosis was a normal part of aging and occurred universally as people became older high blood pressure hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol hypercholesterolemia were also seen as normal consequences of aging in the 1950s and no treatment was initiated these and further risk factors eg homocysteine were gradually discovered over the years      the framingham heart study along with other important large studies eg the seven countries study nurses health study womens health initiative also showed the importance of healthy diet not being overweight or obese and regular exercise in maintaining good health and that there are differences in cardiovascular risk between men and women   it also confirmed that cigarette smoking is a highly significant factor in the development of heart disease leading to angina pectoris myocardial infarction mi and coronary death along with other important studies about smoking eg the british doctors study   recently the framingham studies have become regarded as overestimating risk particularly in the lower risk groups eg for uk populations  one question in evidencebased medicine is how closely the people in a study resemble the patient with which the healthcare professional is dealing  there has been discussion of the study in this regard researchers recently used contact information given by subjects over the last 30 years to map the social network of friends and family in the study  the 10year cardiovascular risk of an individual can be estimated with the easy to use framingham risk score including individuals without known cardiovascular disease the framingham risk score is based on findings of the framingham heart study major findings from the framingham heart study according to the researchers themselves  the framingham heart study participants and their children and grandchildren voluntarily consented to undergo a detailed medical history physical examination and medical tests every two years  creating a wealth of data about physical and mental health especially about cardiovascular disease in recent years scientists have been carrying out genetic research within the framingham heart study inheritance patterns in families  heritability and genetic correlations  molecular markers  and associations have been studied the association studies include traditional genetic association studies ie looking for associations of cardiovascular risk with gene polymorphisms singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps in candidate genes and genome wide association studies gwas  for example one genome wide study called the 100 k study included almost 1400 participants of the framingham heart study from the original cohort and the offspring cohort and revealed a genetic variant associated with obesity the researchers were able to replicate this particular result in four other populations  further the share study snp health association resource study uncovered new candidate genes and confirmed already known candidate genes for homocysteine and vitamin b12 levels in participants of the framingham heart study  because of these exciting genomic results the framingham heart study has been described as on its way to becoming the gold standard for cardiovascular genetic epidemiology  however clinically despite these and other efforts the aggregate effect of genes on cardiovascular disease risk beyond that of traditional cardiovascular risk factors has not been established until now

V hormonal breast enhancement or augmentation is a medical treatment pertaining to the breasts in which hormones or hormonal agents such as estrogen growth hormone gh and insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 are utilized or manipulated to produce breast enlargement in women   it is an alternative or supplement to surgical breast augmentation with breast implants or fat transfer and other means of medical breast enlargement  in addition to pharmaceuticals some herbal breast enlargement supplements contain phytoestrogens such as 8prenylnaringenin found in hops and miroestrol a constituent of pueraria mirifica and thus may be regarded as a form of hormonal breast enhancement  however evidence of their effectiveness as well as safety data are lacking    at puberty estrogen but not progesterone at this time and ghigf1 are essential for mediating the development of the breasts and are synergistic in doing so      hormonal contraception and hormone replacement therapy hrt with estrogen andor progestogens have been associated with increased breast growth and breast size   a trial of hormonal breast enhancement in 45 young women with very high doses 80mginjection of intramuscular bioidentical estrogen in the form of estradiol polyphosphate a slowreleasing estradiol prodrug for six months found that only the women in whom an increase in igf1 levels occurred after four weeks 467 of subjects experienced a significant increase in breast size 8243mm to 8985mm   this is in accordance with the established fact that both estrogen and igf1 are essential for breast development and when present together are synergistic in mediating it   administration of estrogen to women with turner syndrome who normally do not develop breasts due to hypogonadism results in normal pubertal breast development  estrogen and gh are often combined in turner syndrome   estrogen in combination with gh or igf1 has been employed safely and effectively to improve bone density in women with anorexia nervosa    trans women who are treated with estrogen experience normal pubertal breast development similarly to the case of girls with turner syndrome  however they generally show a smaller final breast size in comparison to their immediate relatives one cup size less on average  this is perhaps due to the fact that most trans women do not commence hrt until adulthood which is of relevance because ghigf1 levels significantly and progressively decrease after normal adolescent puberty from late adolescenceearly adulthood and thereafter  as such synergy of estrogen with ghigf1 and by extension maximal breast development potential may be reduced systemic administration of gh or igf1 causes mammary hyperplasia enlargement of the mammary glands in animals  for example in a study of aged female rhesus macaques treatment with gh alone igf1 alone and the combination of gh and igf1 were found to produce mammary gland hyperplasia and increased mammary gland size and epithelial proliferation by 2fold 3 to 4fold and 4 to 5fold respectively changes that were directly correlated with serum concentrations of gh and igf1    in accordance with findings on ghigf1 research has found that girls with growth hormone deficiency ghd who are treated with gh experience accelerated breast growth  and that boys with ghd treated with gh sometimes experience gynecomastia  moreover igf1 levels and activity have been found to be correlated with breast volume in the female general population  paradoxically however women with laron syndrome a condition of insensitivity to gh characterized by very low serum igf1 concentrations reach normal breast size and the breasts may be large in relation to body size in spite of ghigf1 axis insufficiency  however contradictorily it has also been reported that breast development is affected in women with laron syndrome but that the breasts can support normal lactation and that in animal models of laron syndrome mammary gland development is impaired but not abolished   certain longacting growth hormone secretagogues such as cjc1295  and ibutamoren mk677  are capable of reliably and effectively increasing serum gh and igf1 concentrations in humans    alternatively exogenous pharmaceutical gh and igf1 as mecasermin or mecasermin rinfabate themselves or analogues of igf1 such as des13igf1 and igf1 lr3 may be employed to increase ghigf1 axis function a number of dietary supplements including larginine lornithine llysine acetyllcarnitine and creatine may be able to significantly increase gh levels although evidence is mixed      vitamin d has been found to increase igf1 levels in both healthy subjects and individuals with ghd and vitamin d deficiency is associated with low igf1 levels    however there is evidence that vitamin d may also potently inhibit breast growth via activation of the vitamin d receptor     oral estrogen treatment suppresses igf1 production in the liver where approximately 80 of serum igf1 originates from  and reduces total serum igf1 levels by 1540 dependent on dose and type of estrogen administered as well as increases levels of insulinlike growth factorbinding protein 1 igfbp1 a carrier protein that inhibits igf1 bindingactivity  this results in a state of functional gh resistance as gh induces igf1 production and secretion in the liver to mediate most of its effects  with combined oral estrogen and gh being less effective in evoking the clinical effects of gh relative to gh alone in clinical studies of individuals with hypopituitarismghd  in contrast treatment with combined gh and transdermal estrogen has been found not to decrease igf1 levels or increase igfbp1 levels  as such estrogen administered via other routes of administration that bypass the liver such as transdermal in the form of estrogen patches sublingual intranasal intramuscular injection and subcutaneous injection may be significantly more effective than oral estrogen  progesterone and nonandrogenic progestins such as dydrogesterone do not affect serum igf1 levels regardless of route of administration  however androgenic progestins such as 19nortestosterone derivatives like norethisterone and levonorgestrel and others like to a lesser extent medroxyprogesterone acetate mpa when taken orally induce igf1 production via activation of the androgen receptor ar in the liver  however at the same time androgens potently inhibit estrogen action on the breast such as by suppressing er expression in breast tissue and this action would be expected to likely cancel out any benefit   in accordance a single small clinical study found that the addition of oral mpa to estrogen in trans women undergoing sex reassignment therapy did not result in increased breast size  diet and nutrition have been found to affect serum igf1 levels specifically low protein intake fasting and malnourishment are associated with low igf1 levels whereas obesity is associated with high or normal igf1 levels and lowered igfbp1 and igfbp3 levels resulting in higher free igf1 concentrations    in addition milk consumption and circulating igf1 levels have been found to be positively correlated  aside from diet and nutrition exercise has also been found to significantly increase gh levels  androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone dht powerfully suppress the action of estrogen in the breasts     at least one way that they do this is by reducing the expression of the estrogen receptor in breast tissue   in women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais who are completely insensitive to androgens and have only modest levels of estrogen 50 pgml the relatively low levels of estrogen are capable of mediating significant breast development and the breast sizes of cais women on average are in fact actually larger than those of noncais women  in males treated with antiandrogens gynecomastia enlargement of the breasts in males and mastodynia breast tendernesspain commonly occur    antiandrogens for instance spironolactone are also known to cause breast enlargement and mastodynia in women  some examples of widelyused and highlypotent antiandrogens include cyproterone acetate and bicalutamide   cyclooxygenase2 cox2 overexpression in mammary gland tissue produces mammary gland hyperplasia as well as precocious mammary gland development in female mice indicating a strong stimulatory effect of this enzyme on the growth of the mammary glands   these effects appear to be downstream actions of increased activation of the prostaglandin ep2 ep3 and ep4 receptors but not the ep1 receptor in mammary gland tissue which in turn results in the potent induction of amphiregulin expression a critical growth factor involved in normal mammary gland development   in addition agonists of the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr the molecular target of amphiregulin induce cox2 expression in mammary gland tissue potentially resulting in a selfperpetuating cycle of growth amplification by cox2   this is in accordance with the fact that longterm administration of aspirin a cox inhibitor as well as of other coxinhibiting nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids have been found to slightly reduce the risk of breast cancer in women it is notable here that breast growthsize and breast cancer risk are positively associated  taken together these findings indicate that cox2 inhibitors such as aspirin ibuprofen naproxen paracetamol acetaminophen and celecoxib may suppress growth of breast tissue   longterm treatment with estrogens andor progestogens in women specifically in the form of oral contraceptives appears to be associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer   the risk appears to be highest in younger women notably in those who started taking oral contraceptives before 20 years of age  this could be related to increased synergy of estrogens with the higher levels of ghigf1 that are present with younger age  research has suggested that the enhancement of growth factor pathways including that of ghigf1 could potentially increase the risk of various cancers including breast cancer  multiple large studies have found a correlation in premenopausal women between serum igf1 levels in the upper quartile of the normal range and igfbp3 levels in the lower quartile ie high circulating igf1 levels and low circulating ifgbp3 levels and the risk of developing various cancers including breast cancer   however the increase in breast cancer risk has been found only to be modest eg only more than twice the usual risk  subsequent studies have found the increase in risk to be even less clear and it is notable that highnormal range igf1 levels have been found to correlate only with premenopausal and not with postmenopausal breast cancer incidence   in any case mice engineered to have lower circulating levels of igf1 show a lower risk of developing various cancers including breast cancer  in contrast to the case of igf1 the upper quintile 20 of postmenopausal women with the highest of both circulating estrogen and androgen levels have been found to have a significantly increased risk of breast cancer relative to lowest quintile the risk is 2 to 3fold higher  a significant positive association with breast cancer risk has also been found with prolactin levels in postmenopausal women  in acromegaly a condition caused and maintained by highly elevated ghigf1 levels overall there appears to be little or no increased risk of breast cancer nor certain other cancers eg prostate cancer lung cancer   that said cancer risk does appear to be consistently elevated in individuals specifically with uncontrolled disease  in addition there appears to be an increased risk of colorectal cancer and premalignant tubular adenomas in acromegaly  in any case individuals with acromegaly appear to show no increased risk of cancer mortality or general mortality posttreatment ie after their ghigf1 levels have been normalized with medical treatment  largerscale studies are needed however   increased proliferation due to increased igf1 activity has been suggested to possibly play a key role in the high risk of breast cancer seen in women with the brca1 mutation  there has been concern expressed about doping in athletes with ghigf1 and possible increased risk of cancer including breast cancer  people with laron syndrome a condition characterized by insensitivity to gh and very low igf1 levels have a majorly reduced in fact almost absent risk of developing cancer including breast cancer

V breast ironing also known as breast flattening  is the pounding and massaging of a pubescent girls breasts using hard or heated objects to try to make them stop developing or to disappear   it is typically carried out by the girls mother who will say she is trying to protect the girl from sexual harassment and rape  to prevent early pregnancy that would tarnish the family name  or to allow the girl to pursue education rather than be forced into early marriage   it is mostly practiced in parts of cameroon where boys and men may think that girls whose breasts have begun to grow are ready for sex  there are also fears that it has spread to the cameroonian diaspora for example to that in britain  the most widely used implement for breast ironing is a wooden pestle normally used for pounding tubers other tools used include leaves  bananas coconut shells  grinding stones ladles spatulas  and hammers heated over coals    breast ironing is practiced in all ten regions of cameroon  and has also been reported across west and central africa in benin chad ivory coast guineabissau guineaconakry kenya togo and zimbabwe breast sweeping has been reported in south africa  all of cameroons 200 ethnic groups engage in breast ironing  with no known relation to religion socioeconomic status or any other identifier  a june 2006 survey by the german development agency giz of more than 5000 cameroonian girls and women between the ages of 10 and 82 estimated that nearly one in four had undergone breast ironing corresponding to four million girls the survey also reported that it is most commonly practiced in urban areas where mothers fear their children could be more exposed to sexual abuse  incidence is as high as 53 percent in the cameroons southeastern region of littoral  compared with cameroons christian and animist south breast ironing is less common in the muslim north where only 10 percent of women are affected  some hypothesize that this is related to the practice of early marriage which is more common in the north making early sexual development irrelevant or even preferable  a rise in the incidence of breast ironing in recent times has been attributed to the earlier onset of puberty caused by dietary improvements in cameroon over the last 50 years  half of cameroonian girls who develop under the age of nine have their breasts ironed  and 38 of those who develop under the age of eleven  additionally since 1976 the percentage of women married by the age of 19 has decreased from nearly 50 to 20 leading to an increasingly long gap between childhood and marriage the later age of marriage may be due to changed social norms that allow girls and women to attend school through university and to hold jobs in the formal sector women who delay marriage in pursuit of education and career can procure the corresponding benefit of financial independence later in life whereas girls who become pregnant are often forced to drop out of school and forgo formal employment  there are fears that the practice has spread to the cameroonian diaspora for example to that in britain  a charity came womens and girls development organisation is currently working with londons metropolitan police and social services departments to raise awareness regarding the problem  breast ironing is extremely painful and can cause tissue damage there have been no medical studies on its effects  however medical experts warn it might contribute toward breast cancer cysts and depression  and perhaps interfere with breastfeeding later  other possible sideeffects reported by giz include breast infections the formation of abscesses malformed breasts and the eradication of one or both breasts the practice ranges dramatically in its severity from using heated leaves to press and massage the breasts to using a scalding grinding stone to crush the budding gland due to the range of this activity health consequences vary from benign to acute  as well as being dangerous breast ironing is criticized as being ineffective for stopping early sex and pregnancy giz then called gtz and the network of aunties renata a cameroonian nongovernmental organization that supports young mothers campaign against breast ironing  and are supported by the ministry for the promotion of women and the family  some have also advocated a law against the practice however no such law has been passed  according to one cameroonian lawyer if a medical doctor determines that damage has been caused to the breasts the perpetrator can be punished by up to three years in prison provided the matter is reported within a few months  however it is unclear if such a law exists as there are no recorded instances of legal enforcement  the giz survey found that 39 percent of cameroonian women opposed breast ironing with 41 percent expressing support and 26 percent indifferent

V a semicircular canal or a semicircular duct is one of three semicircular interconnected tubes located inside each ear the three canals are   the anterior and posterior semicircular ducts are oriented vertically at right angles to each other the lateral semicircular duct is about 30degree angle from the horizontal plane the orientations of the ducts cause a different duct to be stimulated by rotation of the head in different planes thus the horizontal canal detects angular acceleration of the head such as when you spin in a rotating chair while the superior and posterior canals detect vertical head movements such as when you bend forward to pick something up from the floor  the semicircular canals are a component of the bony labyrinth among species of mammals the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion specifically species that are agile and have fast jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously  the lateral or horizontal canal external semicircular canal is the shortest of the three canals movement of fluid within this canal corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis ie the neck or in other words rotation in the transverse plane this occurs for example when you turn your head to the left and right hand sides before crossing a road it measures from 12 to 15mm and its arch is directed horizontally backward and laterally thus each semicircular canal stands at right angles to the other two its ampullated end corresponds to the upper and lateral angle of the vestibule just above the fenestra vestibuli where it opens close to the ampullated end of the superior canal its opposite end opens at the upper and back part of the vestibule the lateral canal of one ear is very nearly in the same plane as that of the other while the superior canal of one ear is nearly parallel to the posterior canal of the other the superior semicircular canal anterior semicircular canal is a part of the vestibular system and detects rotations of the head in around the lateral axis or in other words rotation in the sagittal plane this occurs for example when nodding your head it is 15 to 20mm in length is vertical in direction and is placed transversely to the long axis of the petrous part of the temporal bone on the anterior surface of which its arch forms a round projection as part of the vestibular system it detects rotation of the head around a rostralcaudal anteriorposterior axis it describes about twothirds of a circle its lateral extremity is ampullated and opens into the upper part of the vestibule the opposite end joins with the upper part of the posterior canal to form the crus commune which opens into the upper and medial part of the vestibule the posterior semicircular canal is a part of the vestibular system detects rotation of the head around a rostralcaudal anteriorposterior axis or in other words rotation in the coronal plane this occurs for example when you move your head to touch your shoulders or when doing a cartwheel it is directed superiorly as per its nomenclature and posteriorly nearly parallel to the posterior surface of the petrous bone the vestibular canaliculus is immediately medial to it it is part of the bony labyrinth and is used by the vestibular system to detect rotations of the head in the sagittal plane it is the longest of the three canals measuring from 18 to 22 mm its lower or ampullated end opens into the lower and back part of the vestibule its upper into the crus commune findings from a 2009 study demonstrated a critical late role for bmp2b in the morphogenesis of semicircular canals in the zebrafish inner ear it is suspected that the role of bmp2 in semicircular canal duct outgrowth is likely to be conserved between different vertebrate species  each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains motion sensors within the fluids at the base of each canal the bony region of the canal is enlarged which opens into the utricle and has a dilated sac at one end called the osseous ampullae within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris these hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula as the head rotates the duct moves but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia this deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within the bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected stopping the sensation of acceleration  the specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph consequently the cupula is not displaced by gravity unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule as with macular hair cells hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition in the horizontal canal ampullopetal flow is necessary for haircell stimulation whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary in the anterior and posterior canals  this adjustment period is in part the cause of an illusion known as the leans often experienced by pilots as a pilot enters a turn hair cells in the semicircular canals are stimulated telling the brain that the aircraft and the pilot are no longer moving in a straight line but rather making a banked turn if the pilot were to sustain a constant rate turn the endolymph would eventually catch up with the ducts and cease to deflect the cupula the pilot would no longer feel as if the aircraft was in a turn as the pilot exits the turn the semicircular canals are stimulated to make the pilot think that they are now turning in the opposite direction rather than flying straight and level in response to this the pilot will often lean in the direction of the original turn in an attempt to compensate for this illusion a more serious form of this is called a graveyard spiral rather than the pilot leaning in the direction of the original turn they may actually reenter the turn as the endolymph stabilizes the semicircular canals stop registering the gradual turn and the aircraft slowly loses altitude until impacting with the ground  the semicircular ducts provide sensory input for experiences of rotary movements they are oriented along the pitch roll and yaw axes this article incorporates text in the public domain from the 20th edition of grays anatomy 1918 coronal section of right temporal bone the cochlea and vestibule viewed from above transverse section through head of fetal sheep in the region of the labyrinth x 30 position of the right bony labyrinth of the ear in the skull viewed from above the

V breast milk is the milk produced by the breasts or mammary glands of a human female for her infant offspring milk is the primary source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed either exclusively or in combination with other foods from around six months of age when solid foods may be introduced   the baby nursing from his or her own mother is the most common way of obtaining breast milk but the milk can be pumped and then fed by baby bottle cup andor spoon supplementation drip system or nasogastric tube breast milk can be supplied by a woman other than the babys mother either via donated pumped milk generally from a milk bank or via informal milk donation or when a woman nurses a child other than her own at her breast a practice known as wetnursing the world health organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life with solids gradually being introduced around this age when signs of readiness are shown supplemented breastfeeding is recommended until at least age two and then for as long as the mother and child wish  breastfeeding offers health benefits to mother and child even after toddlerhood  these benefits include a 73 decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome  increased intelligence  decreased likelihood of contracting middle ear infections  cold and flu resistance  a tiny decrease in the risk of childhood leukemia  lower risk of childhood onset diabetes  decreased risk of asthma and eczema  decreased dental problems  decreased risk of obesity later in life  and a decreased risk of developing psychological disorders including in adopted children   breastfeeding also provides health benefits for the mother it assists the uterus in returning to its prepregnancy size and reduces postpartum bleeding as well as assisting the mother in returning to her prepregnancy weight breastfeeding also reduces the risk of breast cancer later in life   lactation protects both mother and infant from both types of diabetes  though it now is almost universally prescribed in some countries in the 1950s the practice of breastfeeding went through a period where it was out of vogue and the use of infant formula was considered superior to breast milk however it is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk in addition to the appropriate amounts of carbohydrate protein and fat breast milk provides vitamins minerals digestive enzymes  and hormones  breast milk also contains antibodies and lymphocytes from the mother that help the baby resist infections  the immune function of breast milk is individualized as the mother through her touching and taking care of the baby comes into contact with pathogens that colonize the baby and as a consequence her body makes the appropriate antibodies and immune cells  at around four to six months of age the internal iron supplies of the infant held in the hepatic cells of the liver are exhausted hence this is the time that complementary feeding is introduced   breast milk contains less iron than formula because it is more bioavailable as lactoferrin which carries more safety for mothers and children than ferrous sulphate  under the influence of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin women produce milk after childbirth to feed the baby the initial milk produced is referred to as colostrum which is high in the immunoglobulin iga which coats the gastrointestinal tract this helps to protect the newborn until its own immune system is functioning properly it also creates a mild laxative effect expelling meconium and helping to prevent the buildup of bilirubin a contributory factor in jaundice actual inability to produce enough milk is rare with studies showing that mothers from developing countries experiencing nutritional hardship still produce amounts of milk of similar quality to that of mothers in developed countries  there are many reasons a mother may not produce enough breast milk some of the most common reasons are an improper latch ie the baby does not connect efficiently with the nipple not nursing or pumping enough to meet supply certain medications including estrogencontaining hormonal contraceptives illness and dehydration a rarer reason is sheehans syndrome also known as postpartum hypopituitarism which is associated with prolactin deficiency and may require hormone replacement the amount of milk produced depends on how often the mother is nursing andor pumping the more the mother nurses her baby or pumps the more milk is produced     it is beneficial to nurse when the baby wants to nurse rather than on a schedule a cochrane review came to the result that a greater volume of milk is expressed whilst listening to relaxing audio during breastfeeding along with warming and massaging of the breast prior to and during feeding a greater volume of milk expressed can also be attributed to instances where the mother starts pumping milk sooner even if the infant is unable to breastfeed  sodium concentration is higher in handexpressed milk when compared with the use of manual and electric pumps and fat content is higher when the breast has been massaged in conjunction with listening to relaxing audio this may be important for low birthweight infants  if pumping it is helpful to have an electric highgrade pump so that all of the milk ducts are stimulated galactagogues increase milk supply although even herbal variants carry risks therefore nonpharmaceutical methods should be tried first   breast milk contains complex proteins lipids carbohydrates and other biologically active components the composition changes over a single feed as well as over the period of lactation  during the first few days after delivery the mother produces colostrum this is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that sometimes leaks from the breasts during pregnancy it is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby the babys immune system is not fully developed at birth colostrum also helps the newborns digestive system to grow and function properly colostrum will gradually change to become mature milk in the first 34 days it will appear thin and watery and will taste very sweet later the milk will be thicker and creamier human milk quenches the babys thirst and hunger and provides the proteins sugar minerals and antibodies that the baby needs in the 1980s and 1990s lactation professionals de cleats used to make a differentiation between foremilk and hindmilk but this differentiation causes confusion as there are not two types of milk instead as a baby breastfeeds the fat content very gradually increases with the milk becoming fattier and fattier over time  the level of immunoglobulin a iga in breast milk remains high from day 10 until at least 75 months postpartum  human milk contains 08 to 09 protein 45 fat 71 carbohydrates and 02 ash minerals  carbohydrates are mainly lactose several lactosebased oligosaccharides have been identified as minor components the fat fraction contains specific triglycerides of palmitic and oleic acid opo triglycerides and also lipids with trans bonds see trans fat the lipids are vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid cla accounting for up to 6 of the human milk fat   the principal proteins are alphalactalbumin lactoferrin apolactoferrin iga lysozyme and serum albumin in an acidic environment such as the stomach alphalactalbumin unfolds into a different form and binds oleic acid to form a complex called hamlet that kills tumor cells this is thought to contribute to the protection of breastfed babies against cancer  nonprotein nitrogencontaining compounds making up 25 of the milks nitrogen include urea uric acid creatine creatinine amino acids and nucleotides   breast milk has circadian variations some of the nucleotides are more commonly produced during the night others during the day  mothers milk has been shown to supply endocannabinoids the natural neurotransmitters that marijuana simulates 2arachidonoyl glycerol  and anandamide   they may act as an appetite stimulant but they also regulate appetite so infants dont eat too much that may be why formulafed babies have a higher caloric intake than breastfed babies  breast milk isnt sterile but contains as many as 600 different species of various bacteria including beneficial bifidobacterium breve b adolescentis b longum b bifidum and b dentium  breast milk contains a unique type of sugars human milk oligosaccharides hmos which are not present in infant formula hmos are not digested by the infant but help to make up the intestinal flora they act as decoy receptors that block the attachment of disease causing pathogens which may help to prevent infectious diseases they also alter immune cell responses which may benefit the infant to date 2015 more than a hundred different hmos have been identified both the number and composition vary between women and each hmo may have a distinct functionality  the breast milk of diabetic mothers has been shown to have a different composition from that of nondiabetic mothers it may contain elevated levels of glucose and insulin and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids a dosedependent effect of diabetic breast milk on increasing language delays in infants has also been noted although doctors recommend that diabetic mothers breastfeed despite this potential risk  women breastfeeding should consult with their physician regarding substances that can be unwittingly passed to the infant via breast milk such as alcohol viruses hiv or htlv1 or medications most women that do not breastfeed use infant formula but breast milk donated by volunteers to human milk banks can be obtained by prescription in some countries  expressed breast milk can be stored lipase may cause thawed milk to taste soapy or rancid due to milk fat breakdown it is still safe to use and most babies will drink it scalding it will prevent rancid taste at the expense of antibodies  it should be stored with airtight seals  some plastic bags are designed for storage periods of less than 72 hours others can be used for up to 12 months if frozen this table describes safe storage time limits  all mammalian species produce milk but the composition of milk for each species varies widely and other kinds of milk are often very different from human breast milk as a rule the milk of mammals that nurse frequently including human babies is less rich or more watery than the milk of mammals whose young nurse less often human milk is noticeably thinner and sweeter than cows milk whole cows milk contains too little iron retinol vitamin e vitamin c vitamin d unsaturated fats or essential fatty acids for human babies     whole cows milk also contains too much protein sodium potassium phosphorus and chloride which may put a strain on an infants immature kidneys in addition the proteins fats and calcium in whole cows milk are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk    evaporated milk may be easier to digest due to the processing of the protein but is still nutritionally inadequate some infants are allergic to cows milk protein this problem affecting infant formulas derived from cows milk  in addition to providing essential nourishment to infants human milk ie breast milk has a number of valuable uses especially medicinal uses for both children and adults it has been used medicinally for thousands of years   breast milk contains strong antibodies and antitoxins that many people believe promote healing and better overall health however breast milk lacks sterile and antiseptic properties if a nursing mother is infected with certain communicable diseases such as hiv and cmv as breast milk can transmit such diseases to infants and other people   breast milk has been used as a home remedy for minor ailments such as conjunctivitis insect bites and stings contact dermatitis and infected wounds burns and abrasions breast milk has also been used alternatively to boost the immune system of ill persons having viral gastroenteritis influenza the common cold pneumonia etc because of its immunologic properties however breast milk should never be seen or construed as a cureall some medical experts are convinced that breast milk can induce apoptosis in some types of cancer cells however more research and evidence are needed in this area of cancer treatment  a minority of people including restaurateurs hans lochen of switzerland and daniel angerer of austria who operates a restaurant in new york city have used human breast milk or at least advocated its use as a substitute for cows milk in dairy products and food recipes  tammy frisselldeppe a family counselor specialized in attachment parenting published a book titled a breastfeeding mothers secret recipes providing a lengthy compilation of detailed food and beverage recipes containing human breast milk  the animal rights organization known as peta ignited a firestorm of criticism when it urged a dairy company to replace the cows milk they use in their ice cream products with human breast milk as a way to stop cattle abuse   human breast milk is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially because the use of human breast milk as an adult food is considered unusual to the majority of cultures around the world and most disapprove of such a practice  attempts to formulate soap from breast milk have also been made and those using it claim that its effectiveness as a cleanser is greater than or equal to that of traditional soaps  environmental pollutants found in breast milk are usually not harmful and should be considered only when environmental levels are unusually high in addition there has been a decrease in environmental levels also resulting in a decrease breastmilk levels pollutants that are of most concern are pesticides organic mercury and lead ddt and dieldrin are unavoidable and can also be detected in infant formulas  pesticides and other toxic substances bioaccumulate ie creatures higher up the food chain will store more of them in their body fat this is an issue in particular for the inuit whose traditional diet is predominantly meat studies are looking at the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls and persistent organic pollutants in the body the breast milk of inuit mothers is extraordinarily high in toxic compounds  persistent toxins were first discovered in breast milk in 1951 when a group of mothers were tested for the pesticide ddt in 1966 a swedish researcher found that his wifes breast milk contained polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and five years later sweden banned pcbs with the united states following a few years later but because of their widespread use and persistence they are still the highestconcentration toxins in breast milk most scientists maintain that prenatal exposure to pcbs can do real damage researchers in the great lakes region the arctic and the netherlands found that babies born to mothers with mid to upperrange background levels of pcb contamination most likely because of diets rich in contaminated fish and animal products have reduced immunities against infections lower iqs and delayed learning capabilities with some problems lasting at least into early adolescence however researchers were surprised to learn that although the children who were breastfed had higher pcb levels than children who were not breastfed they consistently performed better than those who drank formulabreast milk appeared to be at least partly protective against the effects of toxic chemicals  in 1981 researchers in the us discovered the flame retardant pbde in stored human milk samples testing showed that between the early 70s when the chemical first came into use and up to 1998 levels of pbdes in breast milk were doubling every five years and levels were found to be 10 to 100 times higher than those of women in europe and japan  in costa rica there have been trials to produce cheese and custard from human milk as an alternative to weaning  a controversial swiss restaurateur has created a menu based around foods cooked in human breast milk  an icecreamist in londons covent garden started selling an ice cream named baby gaga in february 2011 each serving costs 14 all the milk was donated by mrs hiley who earns 15 for every 10 ounces and calls it a great recession beater  the ice cream sold out on its first day despite the success of the new flavour the westminster council officers removed the product from the menu to make sure that it was as they said fit for human consumption  while there is no scientific evidence that shows that breast milk is more advantageous for adults than cows milk according to several 2015 news sources breast milk is being used by bodybuilders for its nutritional value in a february 2015 abc news article one former competitive body builder said it isnt common but ive known people who have done this its certainly talked about quite a bit on the bodybuilding forums on the internet calling bodybuilders a strange breed of individuals he said even if this type of thing is completely unsupported by research theyre prone to gym lore and willing to give it a shot if there is any potential effect at the time the article was written in the us the price of breast milk was about 10 an ounce compared to cows milk at about 344 a gallon   there is a market for human breast milk both in the form of wet nurse service and milk product as a product breast milk is exchanged by human milk banks as well as directly between milk donors and customers mediated by websites on the internet human milk banks generally have standardized measures for screening donors and storing the milk while donors on websites vary in regard to these measures a study in 2013 came to the result that 74 of breast milk samples from providers found from websites were colonized with gramnegative bacteria or had more than 10000 colonyforming unitsml of aerobic bacteria  growth

V the pineal gland also known as the pineal body conarium or epiphysis cerebri is a small endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain it produces melatonin a serotonin derived hormone which affects the modulation of sleep patterns in both seasonal and circadian rhythms   its shape resembles a tiny pine cone hence its name and it is located in the epithalamus near the center of the brain between the two hemispheres tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join nearly all vertebrate species possess a pineal gland the most important exception is the hagfish which is often thought of as the most primitive extant vertebrate  even in the hagfish however there may be a pineal equivalent structure in the dorsal diencephalon  the lancelet branchiostoma lanceolatum the nearest existing relative to vertebrates also lacks a recognizable pineal gland  the lamprey considered almost as primitive as the hagfish however does possess one  a few more developed vertebrates including the alligator lack pineal glands because they have been lost over the course of evolution  the results of various scientific research in evolutionary biology comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology have explained the phylogeny of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species from the point of view of biological evolution the pineal gland represents a kind of atrophied photoreceptor in the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles it is linked to a vestigial organ known as the parietal eye which is also called the third eye  rené descartes believed the pineal gland to be the principal seat of the soul a mystical concept academic philosophy among his contemporaries considered the pineal gland as a neuroanatomical structure without special metaphysical qualities science studied it as one endocrine gland among many however the pineal gland continues to have an exalted status in the realm of pseudoscience    the pineal gland is the only midline brain structure that is unpaired azygous it takes its name from its pinecone shape  the gland is reddishgray and about the size of a grain of rice 58mm in humans the pineal gland also called the pineal body is part of the epithalamus and lies between the laterally positioned thalamic bodies and behind the habenular commissure it is located in the quadrigeminal cistern near to the corpora quadrigemina  it is also located behind the third ventricle and is bathed in cerebrospinal fluid supplied through a small pineal recess of the third ventricle which projects into the stalk of the gland  unlike most of the mammalian brain the pineal gland is not isolated from the body by the bloodbrain barrier system  it has profuse blood flow second only to the kidney  supplied from the choroidal branches of the posterior cerebral artery the pineal gland receives a sympathetic innervation from the superior cervical ganglion a parasympathetic innervation from the pterygopalatine and otic ganglia is also present  further some nerve fibers penetrate into the pineal gland via the pineal stalk central innervation also neurons in the trigeminal ganglion innervate the gland with nerve fibers containing the neuropeptide pacap the pineal body consists in humans of a lobular parenchyma of pinealocytes surrounded by connective tissue spaces the glands surface is covered by a pial capsule the pineal gland consists mainly of pinealocytes but four other cell types have been identified as it is quite cellular in relation to the cortex and white matter it may be mistaken for a neoplasm  in some parts of the brain and in particular the pineal gland there are calcium structures the number of which increases with age called corpora arenacea or acervuli or brain sand chemical analysis shows that they are composed of calcium phosphate calcium carbonate magnesium phosphate and ammonium phosphate  in 2002 deposits of the calcite form of calcium carbonate were described  calcium and phosphorus  deposits in the pineal gland have been linked with aging the human pineal gland grows in size until about 12 years of age remaining stable thereafter   although its weight increases gradually from puberty onwards   the abundant melatonin levels in children are believed to inhibit sexual development and pineal tumors have been linked with precocious puberty when puberty arrives melatonin production is reduced  melatonin is nacetyl5methoxytryptamine a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan which also has other functions in the central nervous system the production of melatonin by the pineal gland is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light   photosensitive cells in the retina detect light and directly signal the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn entraining its rhythm to the 24hour cycle in nature fibers project from the scn to the paraventricular nuclei pvn which relay the circadian signals to the spinal cord and out via the sympathetic system to superior cervical ganglia scg and from there into the pineal gland the compound pinoline is also produced in the pineal gland it is one of the betacarbolines  studies on rodents suggest that the pineal gland influences the pituitary glands secretion of the sex hormones folliclestimulating hormone fsh and luteinizing hormone lh in a study by motta fraschini and martini 1967 a pinealectomy was performed on rodents no change in pituitary weight was observed however there was an increase in the concentration of fsh and lh within the gland in this same study administration of melatonin did not return the concentrations of fsh to normal levels suggesting that the pineal gland influences the pituitary glands secretion of fsh and lh through some other transmitting molecule  studies on rodents suggest that the pineal gland may influence the actions of recreational drugs such as cocaine  and antidepressants such as fluoxetine prozac  and that its hormone melatonin can protect against neurodegeneration  calcification of the pineal gland is typical in young adults and has been observed in children as young as two years of age  the calcified gland is often seen in skull xrays  calcification rates vary widely by country and correlate with an increase in age with calcification occurring in an estimated 40 of americans by their 17th year  calcification of the pineal gland is largely associated with corpora arenacea also known as brain sand it seems that the internal secretions of the pineal gland inhibit the development of the reproductive glands because in cases where it is severely damaged in children the result is accelerated development of the sexual organs and the skeleton  some studies show that the degree of pineal gland calcification is significantly higher in patients with alzheimers disease vs other types of dementia  pineal gland calcification may also contribute to the pathogenesis of alzheimers disease and may reflect an absence of crystallization inhibitors  calcium phosphorus  and fluoride deposits in the pineal gland have been correlated with aging showing that as the brain ages more deposits collect  tumours of the pineal gland are called pinealomas these tumours are rare and 50 to 70 are germinomas that arise from sequestered embryonic germ cells histologically they are similar to testicular seminomas and ovarian dysgerminomas  a pineal tumour can compress the superior colliculi and pretectal area of the dorsal midbrain producing parinauds syndrome pineal tumours also can cause compression of the cerebral aqueduct resulting in a noncommunicating hydrocephalus other manifestations are the consequence of their pressure effects and consist of visual disturbances headache mental deterioration and sometimes dementialike behaviour  these neoplasms are divided into three categories pineoblastomas pineocytomas and mixed tumours based on their level of differentiation which in turn correlates with their neoplastic aggressiveness  the clinical course of patients with pineocytomas is prolonged averaging up to several years  the position of these tumours makes them very difficult or impossible to remove surgically pinealocytes in many nonmammalian vertebrates have a strong resemblance to the photoreceptor cells of the eye some evolutionary biologists believe that the vertebrate pineal cells possess a common evolutionary ancestor with retinal cells  pineal cytostructure seems to have evolutionary similarities to the retinal cells of chordates  modern birds and reptiles have been found to express the phototransducing pigment melanopsin in the pineal gland avian pineal glands are believed to act like the scn in mammals  in some vertebrates exposure to light can set off a chain reaction of enzymatic events within the pineal gland that regulate circadian rhythms  some early vertebrate fossil skulls have a pineal foramen opening this correlates with the physiology of the modern living fossils the lampreys and the tuatara and some other vertebrates that have a parietal eye which in some of them is photosensitive the parietal eye represents evolutions earlier approach to photoreception  the structures of the pineal eye in the tuatara are analogous to the cornea lens and retina though the latter resembles that of an octopus rather than a vertebrate retina the asymmetrical whole consists of the eye to the left and the pineal sac to the right in animals that have lost the parietal eye including mammals the pineal sac is retained and condensed into the form of the pineal gland  fossils seldom preserve soft anatomy the brain of the russian melovatka bird about 90million years old is an exception and it shows a largerthanexpected parietal eye and pineal gland  in humans and other mammals the light signals necessary to set circadian rhythms are sent from the eye through the retinohypothalamic system to the suprachiasmatic nuclei scn and the pineal gland seventeenthcentury philosopher and scientist rené descartes was highly interested in anatomy and physiology he discussed the pineal gland both in his first book the treatise of man written before 1637 but only published posthumously 16621664 and in his last book the passions of the soul 1649 and he regarded it as the principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed  in the treatise of man descartes did not describe man but a kind of conceptual models of man namely creatures created by god which consist of two ingredients a body and a soul   in the passions descartes begins by splitting man up into a body and a soul and emphasized that the soul is joined to the whole body by a certain very small gland situated in the middle of the brains substance and suspended above the passage through which the spirits in the brains anterior cavities communicate with those in its posterior cavities descartes attached significance to the gland because he believed it to be the only section of the brain to exist as a single part rather than onehalf of a pair he argued that because a person can never have more than one thought at a timeexternal stimuli must be united within the brain before being considered by the soul and he considered the pineal gland to be situated in the most suitable possible place for this purpose located centrally in the brain and surrounded by branches of the carotid arteries the pineal gland played an important role in descartes account because it was involved in sensation imagination memory and the causation of bodily movements but most of descartes basic anatomical and physiological assumptions were totally mistaken not only by our standards but also in light of what was already known in his time   baruch de spinoza criticized descartes viewpoint for neither following from selfevident premises nor being clearly and distinctly perceived descartes having previously asserted that he could not draw conclusions of this sort and questioned what descartes meant by talking of the union of the mind and the body  the notion of a pinealeye is central to the philosophy of the french writer georges bataille which is analyzed at length by literary scholar denis hollier in his study against architecture in this work hollier discusses how bataille uses the concept of a pinealeye as a reference to a blindspot in western rationality and an organ of excess and delirium  this conceptual device is explicit in his surrealist texts the jesuve and the pineal eye  numerous spiritual philosophies contain the notion of an inner third eye that is related to the ajna chakra and also to the pineal gland these are attributed significance in mystical awakening or enlightenment clairvoyant perception and higher states of consciousness this idea occurs historically in asia  as well as in contemporary theories connecting to theosophy and neopagan religions as well as new age spiritual philosophies it was particularly expounded by madame blavatsky in 1888 and gained a growing popularity in the west  author and researcher rick strassman has theorised that the pineal gland is capable of producing the hallucinogen nndimethyltryptamine dmt under certain circumstances calling the drug the spirit molecule the current academic philosophy considered the pineal gland as a neuroanatomical structure without special metaphysical qualities science studied it as one endocrine gland among many however the pineal gland continues to have an exalted status in pseudoscience  the secretory activity of the pineal gland is only partially understood its location deep in the brain suggested to philosophers throughout history that it possesses particular importance this combination led to its being regarded as a mystery gland with mystical metaphysical and occult theories surrounding its perceived functions the pineal gland was originally believed to be a vestigial remnant of a larger organ in 1917 it was known that extract of cow pineals lightened frog skin dermatology professor aaron b lerner and colleagues at yale university hoping that a substance from the pineal might be useful in treating skin diseases isolated and named the hormone melatonin in 1958  the substance did not prove to be helpful as intended but its discovery helped solve several mysteries such as why removing the rats pineal accelerated ovary growth why keeping rats in constant light decreased the weight of their pineals and why pinealectomy and constant light affect ovary growth to an equal extent this knowledge gave a boost to the then new field of chronobiology  pineal

V the swim bladder gas bladder fish maw or air bladder is an internal gasfilled organ that contributes to the ability of many bony fish but not cartilaginous fish  to control their buoyancy and thus to stay at their current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming  also the dorsal position of the swim bladder means the center of mass is below the center of volume allowing it to act as a stabilizing agent additionally the swim bladder functions as a resonating chamber to produce or receive sound the swim bladder is evolutionarily homologous to the lungs charles darwin remarked upon this in on the origin of species  in the embryonic stages some species such as redlip blenny  have lost the swim bladder again mostly bottom dwellers like the weather fish other fish like the opah and the pomfret use their pectoral fins to swim and balance the weight of the head to keep a horizontal position the normally bottom dwelling sea robin can use their pectoral fins to produce lift while swimming the gastissue interface at the swim bladder produces a strong reflection of sound which is used in sonar equipment to find fish the cartilaginous fish eg sharks and rays do not have swim bladders some of them can control their depth only by swimming using dynamic lift others store fats or oils with density less than that of seawater to produce a neutral or near neutral buoyancy which does not change with depth   the swim bladder normally consists of two gasfilled sacs located in the dorsal portion of the fish although in a few primitive species there is only a single sac it has flexible walls that contract or expand according to the ambient pressure the walls of the bladder contain very few blood vessels and are lined with guanine crystals which make them impermeable to gases by adjusting the gas pressurising organ using the gas gland or oval window the fish can obtain neutral buoyancy and ascend and descend to a large range of depths due to the dorsal position it gives the fish lateral stability in physostomous swim bladders a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut the pneumatic duct allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by gulping air excess gas can be removed in a similar manner in more derived varieties of fish the physoclisti the connection to the digestive tract is lost in early life stages fish have to rise to the surface to fill up their swim bladders however in later stages the connection disappears and the gas gland has to introduce gas usually oxygen to the bladder to increase its volume and thus increase buoyancy in order to introduce gas into the bladder the gas gland excretes lactic acid and produces carbon dioxide the resulting acidity causes the hemoglobin of the blood to lose its oxygen root effect which then diffuses partly into the swim bladder the blood flowing back to the body first enters a rete mirabile where virtually all the excess carbon dioxide and oxygen produced in the gas gland diffuses back to the arteries supplying the gas gland thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars  elsewhere at a similar structure known as the oval window the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back together with oxygen other gases are salted out  in the swim bladder which accounts for the high pressures of other gases as well  the combination of gases in the bladder varies in shallow water fish the ratios closely approximate that of the atmosphere while deep sea fish tend to have higher percentages of oxygen for instance the eel synaphobranchus has been observed to have 751 oxygen 205 nitrogen 31 carbon dioxide and 04 argon in its swim bladder physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage they prohibit fast rising as the bladder would burst physostomes can burp out gas though this complicates the process of resubmergence in some fish mainly freshwater species eg common carp wels catfish the swim bladder is connected to the labyrinth of the inner ear by the weberian apparatus a bony structure derived from the vertebrae which provides a precise sense of water pressure and thus depth and improves hearing  in redbellied piranha the swimbladder may play an important role in sound production as a resonator the sounds created by piranhas are generated through rapid contractions of the sonic muscles and is associated with the swimbladder  the illustration of the swim bladder in fishes  shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose namely flotation may be converted into one for a widely different purpose namely respiration the swim bladder has also been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fishes all physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous or ideally similar in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals hence there is no reason to doubt that the swim bladder has actually been converted into lungs or an organ used exclusively for respiration according to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient and unknown prototype which was furnished with a floating apparatus or swim bladder swim bladders are evolutionarily closely related ie homologous to lungs it is believed that the first lungs simple sacs connected to the gut that allowed the organism to gulp air under oxygenpoor conditions evolved into the lungs of todays terrestrial vertebrates and some fish eg lungfish gar and bichir and into the swim bladders of the rayfinned fish  in embryonal development both lung and swim bladder originate as an outpocketing from the gut in the case of swim bladders this connection to the gut continues to exist as the pneumatic duct in the more primitive rayfinned fish and is lost in some of the more derived teleost orders there are no animals which have both lungs and a swim bladder the cartilaginous fish eg sharks and rays split from the other fishes about 420 million years ago and lack both lungs and swim bladders suggesting that these structures evolved after that split  correspondingly these fish also have a heterocercal and pectoral fins which provides the necessary lift needed due to the lack of swim bladders on the other hand teleost fish with swim bladders have neutral buoyancy and have no need for this lift  sonar operators using the newly developed sonar technology during world war ii were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor 300500 metres deep at day and less deep at night this turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms most particularly small mesopelagic fish with swimbladders that reflected the sonar these organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton the layer is deeper when the moon is out and can become shallower when clouds pass over the moon  most mesopelagic fish make daily vertical migrations moving at night into the epipelagic zone often following similar migrations of zooplankton and returning to the depths for safety during the day   these vertical migrations often occur over large vertical distances and are undertaken with the assistance of a swim bladder the swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up and given the high pressures in the mesoplegic zone this requires significant energy as the fish ascends the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting when the fish wants to return to the depths the swimbladder is deflated  some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline where the temperature changes between 10 and 20c thus displaying considerable tolerance for temperature change sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65 of all deep sea fish biomass  indeed lanternfish are among the most widely distributed populous and diverse of all vertebrates playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms the estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550660 million metric tonnes several times the entire world fisheries catch lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the worlds oceans sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders giving the appearance of a false bottom  in some asian cultures the swim bladders of certain large fishes are considered a food delicacy in china they are known as fish maw \u82b1\u81a0\u9c7c\u9cd4  and are served in soups or stews swim bladders are also used in the food industry as a source of collagen they can be made into a strong waterresistant glue or used to make isinglass for the clarification of beer in earlier times they were used to make condoms  swim bladder disease is a common ailment in aquarium fish a fish with swim bladder disorder can float nose down tail up or can float to the top or sink to the bottom of the aquarium  fish with a swim bladder are at greater risk of injury after exposure to loud impulsive sounds than those without  siphonophores have a special swim bladder that allows the jellyfishlike colonies to float along the surface of the water while their tentacles trail below this organ is unrelated to the one in fish  swim bladder display in a malacca shopping mall fish maw soup swim bladder disease has resulted in this female ryukin goldfish

V in vertebrate anatomy the pituitary gland or hypophysis is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea and weighing 05 grams 0018oz in humans it is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain the hypophysis rests upon the hypophysial fossa of the sphenoid bone in the center of the middle cranial fossa and is surrounded by a small bony cavity sella turcica covered by a dural fold diaphragma sellae  the anterior pituitary or adenohypophysis is a lobe of the gland that regulates several physiological processes including stress growth reproduction and lactation the intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes melanocytestimulating hormone the posterior pituitary or neurohypophysis is a lobe of the gland that is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the pituitary stalk also called the infundibular stalk or the infundibulum hormones secreted from the pituitary gland help control growth blood pressure certain functions of the sex organs thyroid glands and metabolism as well as some aspects of pregnancy childbirth nursing watersalt concentration and the kidneys temperature regulation and pain relief   the pituitary gland in humans is a peasized gland that sits in a protective bony enclosure called the sella turcica it is composed of three lobes anterior intermediate and posterior in many animals these three lobes are distinct the intermediate lobe is present in many species in particular in rodents mice and rats that have been used extensively to study pituitary development and function but it regresses in humans at about the 15th week of gestation it is thus absent from the adult human pituitary gland  in all animals the fleshy glandular anterior pituitary is distinct from the neural composition of the posterior pituitary which is an extension of the ventral diencephalon or hypothalamus  the anterior pituitary arises from an invagination of the oral ectoderm and forms rathkes pouch this contrasts with the posterior pituitary which originates from neuroectoderm endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are controlled by regulatory hormones released by parvocellular neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus the latter release regulatory hormones into hypothalamic capillaries leading to infundibular blood vessels which in turn lead to a second capillary bed in the anterior pituitary this vascular relationship constitutes the hypothalamohypophyseal portal system diffusing out of the second capillary bed the hypothalamic releasing hormones then bind to anterior pituitary endocrine cells upregulating or downregulating their release of hormones  the anterior lobe of the pituitary can be divided into the pars tuberalis pars glandularis and pars distalis pars glandularis that constitutes 80 of the gland the pars intermedia the intermediate lobe lies between the pars distalis and the pars tuberalis and is rudimentary in the human although in other species it is more developed  it develops from a depression in the dorsal wall of the pharynx stomal part known as rathkes pouch the posterior lobe develops as an extension of the hypothalamus the magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the posterior side possess cell bodies located in the hypothalamus that project axons down the infundibulum to terminals in the posterior pituitary this simple arrangement differs sharply from that of the adjacent anterior pituitary which does not develop from the hypothalamus the release of pituitary hormones by both the anterior and posterior lobes is under the control of the hypothalamus albeit in different ways  the anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes hormones all releasing hormones rh referred to can also be referred to as releasing factors rf somatotrophins thyrotrophins corticotropins lactotrophins gonadotropins these hormones are released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of the hypothalamus hypothalamic hormones are secreted to the anterior lobe by way of a special capillary system called the hypothalamichypophysial portal system the intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes the following important endocrine hormone the posterior pituitary stores and secretes but does not synthesize the following important endocrine hormones magnocellular neurons hormones secreted from the pituitary gland help control the following body processes some of the diseases involving the pituitary gland are all of the functions of the pituitary gland can be adversely affected by an over or under production of associated hormones the pituitary gland is important for mediating the stress response via the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis critically pituitary gland growth during adolescence can be altered by early life stress such as childhood maltreatment or maternal dysphoric behavior  the greek physician galen referred to the pituitary gland by only using the ancient greek name \u1f00\u03b4\u03ae\u03bd  gland  he described the pituitary gland as part of a series of secretory organs for the excretion of nasal mucus  anatomist andreas vesalius translated \u1f00\u03b4\u03ae\u03bd with glans in quam pituita destillat gland in which slime pituita  drips   besides this descriptive name vesalius used glandula pituitaria from which the english name pituitary gland  is ultimately derived the expression glandula pituitaria is still used as official synonym beside hypophysis in the official latin nomenclature terminologia anatomica  in the seventeenth century the supposed function of the pituitary gland to produce nasal mucus was debunked  the expression glandula pituitaria and its english equivalent pituitary gland can only be justified from a historical point of view  the inclusion of this synonym is merely justified by noting that the main term hypophysis is a much less popular term  the anatomist samuel thomas von sömmerring coined the name hypophysis  this name consists   of \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc under  and \u03c6\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd to grow  in later greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is used differently by greek physicians as outgrowth  sömmering also used the equivalent expression appendix cerebri   with appendix as appendage  in various languages hirnanhang  in german and hersenaanhangsel  in dutch the terms are derived from appendix cerebri the pituitary gland is found in all vertebrates but its structure varies between different groups the division of the pituitary described above is typical of mammals and is also true to varying degrees of all tetrapods however only in mammals does the posterior pituitary have a compact shape in lungfish it is a relatively flat sheet of tissue lying above the anterior pituitary but in amphibians reptiles and birds it becomes increasingly well developed the intermediate lobe is in general not well developed in any species and is entirely absent in birds  the structure of the pituitary in fish apart from the lungfish is generally different from that in other animals in general the intermediate lobe tends to be well developed and may equal the remainder of the anterior pituitary in size the posterior lobe typically forms a sheet of tissue at the base of the pituitary stalk and in most cases sends irregular fingerlike projection into the tissue of the anterior pituitary which lies directly beneath it the anterior pituitary is typically divided into two regions a more anterior rostral portion and a posterior proximal portion but the boundary between the two is often not clearly marked in elasmobranchs there is an additional ventral lobe beneath the anterior pituitary proper  the arrangement in lampreys which are among the most primitive of all fish may indicate how the pituitary originally evolved in ancestral vertebrates here the posterior pituitary is a simple flat sheet of tissue at the base of the brain and there is no pituitary stalk rathkes pouch remains open to the outside close to the nasal openings closely associated with the pouch are three distinct clusters of glandular tissue corresponding to the intermediate lobe and the rostral and proximal portions of the anterior pituitary these various parts are separated by meningial membranes suggesting that the pituitary of other vertebrates may have formed from the fusion of a pair of separate but associated glands  most armadillos also possess a neural secretory gland very similar in form to the posterior pituitary but located in the tail and associated with the spinal cord this may have a function in osmoregulation  there is a structure analogous to the pituitary in the octopus brain  although rudimentary in humans and often considered part of the anterior pituitary the intermediate lobe located between the anterior and posterior pituitary is important to many animals for instance in fish it is believed to control physiological color change in adult humans it is just a thin layer of cells between the anterior and posterior pituitary the intermediate lobe produces melanocytestimulating hormone msh although this function is often imprecisely attributed to the anterior pituitary the intermediate lobe is in general not well developed in tetrapods and is entirely absent in birds  location of the pituitary gland in the human brain pituitary and pineal glands

V the flocculus latin tuft of wool diminutive is a small lobe of the cerebellum at the posterior border of the middle cerebellar peduncle anterior to the biventer lobule like other parts of the cerebellum the flocculus is involved in motor control it is an essential part of the vestibuloocular reflex and aids in the learning of basic motor skills in the brain it is associated with the nodulus of the vermis together these two structures compose the vestibular part of the cerebellum at its base the flocculus receives input from the inner ears vestibular system and regulates balance many floccular projections connect to the motor nuclei involved in control of eye movement   the flocculus is contained within the flocculonodular lobe which is connected to the cerebellum the cerebellum is the section of the brain that is essential for motor control as a part of the cerebellum the flocculus plays a part of the vestibuloocular reflex system a system that controls the movement of the eye in coordination with movements of the head  there are five separate zones in the flocculus and two halves the caudal and rostral half the flocculus has a complex circuitry that is reflected in the structure of the zones and halves these zones of the flocculus refer to five separate groupings of purkinje cells that project to different areas of the brain depending upon where stimulus occurs in the flocculus signals can be projected to very different parts of the brain the first and third zones of the flocculus project to the superior vestibular nucleus the second and fourth zone projects to the medial vestibular nucleus and the fifth zone projects to the interposed posterior nucleus a part of the cerebellum  the anatomy of the flocculus shows that it is composed of two disjointed lobes or halves the halves of the flocculus refer to the caudal half and the rostral half and they indicate from where fiber projections are received and the path in which a signal travels  the caudal half of the flocculus receives mossy fiber projections mainly from the vestibular system and nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis an area within the floor of the midbrain that affects the axonal projections or images received by the cerebellum vestibular inputs are also carried through climbing fibers that project into the flocculus stimulating purkinje cells leading research would suggest that climbing fibers play a specific role in motor learning  the climbing fibers then send the image or projection to the part of the brain that receives electrical signals and generates movement from the midbrain corticopontine fibers carry information from the primary motor cortex  from there projections are sent to the ipsilateral pontine nucleus in the ventral pons both of which are associated with projections to the cerebellum finally pontocerebellar projections carry vestibulooccular signals to the contralateral cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncle  the rostral half of the flocculus also receives mossy fiber projections from the pontine nuclei however it receives very little projection from the vestibular system the flocculus is a part of the vestibuloocular reflex system and is used to help stabilize gaze during head rotation about any axis of space neurons in both the vermis of cerebellum and flocculus transmit an eye velocity signal that correlates with smooth pursuit the idea that the flocculus is involved in motor learning gave rise to the flocculus hypothesis this hypothesis argues that the flocculus plays a key role in the vestibuloocular system most importantly the ability for the vestibular system to adapt to a shift in the visual field  the learning of basic motor skills including walking balancing and the ability to sit up can be attributed to early patterns and pathways associated with the vestibulooccular reflex and the pathways formed in the cerebellum within the cerebellum pathways that contribute to the learning of basic motor skills the flocculus appears to be included a vor pathway that aids in the adaptation to a repeated shift in the visual field  a shift in the visual field affects an individuals spatial recognition the leading research would suggest that flocculus aids in the synchronization of eye and motor functions after a visual shift occurs in order for the visual field and the motor skills to function together if this shift is repeated the flocculus essentially trains the brain to fully readjust to this repeated stimuli  constituted by two disjointedshaped lobes the flocculus is positioned within the lowest level of the cerebellum there are three main subdivisions in the cerebellum and the flocculus is contained within the most primitive the vestibulocerebellum  its lobes are linked through a circuit of neurons connecting to the vermis the medial structure in the cerebellum extensions leave the base of the folluculars lobes which then connect to the spinal cord the cerebellum which houses the flocculus is located in the back and at the base of the human brain directly above the brainstem  the flocculus is most important for the pursuit of movements with the eyes lesions in the flocculus impair control of the vestibuloocular reflex and gaze holding also known as vestibulocerebellar syndrome  the deficits observed in patients with lesions to this area resemble dosedependent effects of alcohol on pursuit movements  bilateral lesions of the flocculus reduce the gain of smooth pursuit which is the steady tracking of a moving object by the eyes instead the bilateral lesions of the flocculus result in saccadic pursuit in which smooth tracking is replaced by simultaneous rapid movements or jerking motions of the eye to follow an object toward the ipsilateral visual field these lesions also impair the ability to hold the eyes in the eccentric position resulting in gazeevoked nystagmus toward the affected side of the cerebellum  nystagmus is the constant involuntary movements of the eyes a patient can have either horizontal nystagmus sidetoside eye movements vertical nystagmus up and down eye movements or rotary nystagmus circular eye movements  the flocculus also plays a role in keeping the body oriented in space a lesion in this area will result in ataxia a neurological disorder that results in the deterioration of the coordination of muscle movements and unsteady bodily movements such as swaying and staggering  the conditions and systems associated with floccular loss are considered to be a subset of a vestibular disease some symptoms of common vestibular diseases include head tilting an inability to stand ataxia dizziness vomiting and strabismus because of the flocculus role in the vestibular system the inner ear equilibrioception and both peripheral and central vision is affected by any loss or damage to the flocculus these systems are affected because damage to the flocculus prevents any changes from being stored in regards to visual and motor communication meaning that although the vor is still intact these systems are unable to store changes in gain or eye movement as you rotate your head back

V the enchanted loom is a famous metaphor for the human brain invented by the pioneering neuroscientist charles s sherrington in a passage from his 1942 book man on his nature in which he poetically describes his conception of what happens in the cerebral cortex during arousal from sleep  the great topmost sheet of the mass that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither the brain is waking and with it the mind is returning it is as if the milky way entered upon some cosmic dance swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one a shifting harmony of subpatterns  the loom he refers to was undoubtedly meant to be a jacquard loom used for weaving fabric into complex patterns the jacquard loom invented in 1801 was the most complex mechanical device of the 19th century it was controlled by a punch card system that was a forerunner of the system used in computers until the 1970s with as many as thousands of independently movable shuttles a jacquard loom in operation must have appeared very impressive if sherrington had written a decade later however he might perhaps have chosen the flashing lights on the front panel of a computer as his metaphor instead according to the neuroscience historian stanley finger  sherrington probably borrowed the loom metaphor from an earlier writer the psychologist fredric myers who asked his readers to picture the human brain as a vast manufactory in which thousands of looms of complex and differing patterns are habitually at work  perhaps in part because of its slightly cryptic nature the enchanted loom has been an attractive metaphor for many writers about the brain and has supplied the title for several books including the following

V the vertical occipital fasciculus is a fascicle of white material running vertically in the rear of the brain it is found at least in primates it is the only major fiber bundle connecting dorsolateral and ventrolateral visual cortex     originally depicted by carl wernicke who called it the senkrechte occipitalbündel vertical occipital bundle  the region was practically lost to scientific knowledge during the twentieth century  theodor meynert had described the brains other white matter tracts as being horizontally oriented and did not accept wernickes finding heinrich obersteiner named the area the fasciculus occipitalis perpendicularis and heinrich sachs named the area the stratum profundum convexitatis it appeared in a 1918 edition of grays anatomy but fell into obscurity  a diffusion tensor imaging dti study in 2004 noted an area of shortrange association fibers in the lateral occipital lobe which they noted corresponded to the vof  the vertical occipital fasciculus consists of long nerve fibers making connections between vision subregions in the rear of the brain research indicates that it is related to both vision and cognition since injury to it can cause reading impairment

V cardioprotection encompasses several regimens that have shown to preserve function and viability of cardiac muscle cell tissue subjected to ischemic insult or reoxygenation cardioprotection includes strategies that are implemented before an ischemic event preconditioning pc during an ischemic event perconditioning perc and after the event and during reperfusion postconditioning postc  these strategies can be further stratified by performing the intervention locally or remotely creating classes of conditioning known as remote ischemic pc ripc remote ischemic postc and remost ischemic perc  classical local preconditioning has an early phase with an immediate onset lasting 23 hours that protects against myocardial infarction  the early phase involves posttranslational modification of preexisting proteins brought about by the activation of g proteincoupled receptors as well as downstream mapks and pi3akt these signaling events act on the rosgenerating mitochondria activate pkc\u03b5 and the reperfusion injury salvage kinase risk pathway preventing mitochondrial permeability transition pore mtp opening  the late phase with an onset of 1224 hours that lasts 34 days and protects against both infarction and reversible postischemic contractile dysfunction termed myocardial stunning    this phase involves the synthesis of new cardioprotective proteins stimulated by nitric oxide no ros and adenosine acting on kinases such as pkc\u03b5 and src which in turn activate gene transcription and upregulation of late pc molecular players eg antioxidant enzymes inos  a role for pkc\u03b5 in more contemporary cardioprotection strategies including ripc  local postc  and remote postc  have been either demonstrated or suggested it was shown that pkc\u03b5 translocates from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction upon ripc induction and that the protection conferred by ripc can be inhibited with the pkc inhibitor chelerythrine   similarly in models of local postc phosphorylation and activation of pkc\u03b5 has been shown to be induced and pkc\u03b5 inhibition attenuated the beneficial effects of these regimens   a recent study showed that blocking hsp90 function with geldanamycin inhibits postc protection and pkc\u03b5 translocation  additional studies are required to investigate a role for pkc\u03b5 in remote postc and perc as this has not been conclusively demonstrated

V if glands are categorized by shape alveolar glands contrast with tubular glands alveolar glands have a saclike secretory portion thus are also termed saccular glands they typically have an enlarged lumen cavity hence the name similar to alveoli the smallest air sacs in the lungs branched alveolar glands are classified as follows some sources draw a clear distinction between acinar and alveolar glands based upon the size of the lumen  a further complication in the case of the alveolar glands may occur in the form of still smaller saccular diverticuli growing out from the main sacculi the term racemose gland  is used to describe a compound alveolar gland or compound acinar gland  alveoli of lacrimal gland human submaxillary gland at the right is a group of mucous alveoli at the left a group of serous alveoli section of portion of mamma

V the flank gland is one of several specialized posterolateral glands a group of glands located along the sides and the rear found predominately in certain species of rodents including voles shrews hamsters and other members of the family cricetidae   the flank gland is located laterally on each side of the abdomen it is often present in both males and females though this varies by species and is usually larger in males   in some species selfscratching of the flank gland typically with a hind foot causes secretion of an oily substance that leaves the surrounding hair visibly matted and emits a chemical odor  these chemicals vary in composition within the same species as well as within an individual as it progresses through sexual maturity  scent marking via secretions of the flank gland has been observed for example some male microtene rodents will perform drummarking in which they repeatedly scratch their flank gland with their foot and proceed to stomp the ground several times  in dominant individuals the matting of fur at the location of secretion is more conspicuous than in subordinate individuals suggesting it serves as some visual signal  there is also experimental evidence of male golden hamsters and of lab rats fighting after which the victor will scentmark more than the submitter this suggests it is used by dominant individuals to establish territory   there is evidence that rodents can remember odors of individuals and discriminate between those that are familiar and those that are not even when the chemical qualities of the odors are very similar however they are not able to discriminate between nonfamiliar kin and nonkin   additionally female golden hamsters show a sexual preference towards familiar nonkin odors  flank gland size varies between individuals though studies concerning a correlation between size of flank gland and reproductive success in males give conflicting results

V topfreedom is a cultural and political movement seeking to advance gender equality by the recognition of the right of women and girls to be topless in public on the same basis that men and boys are permitted to be barechested in addition topfreedom advocates seek recognition of the right of nursing mothers to openly breastfeed in public and of women to sun bathe topless in north america the topfree equal rights association assists women who have been charged for being topless while gotopless organizes demonstrations to protest against the legal and public attitude to the inequality in sweden bara bröst is active in advancing topfreedom as is topless front in denmark   many societies  consider women who expose their nipples and areolae as immodest and contrary to social norms in many jurisdictions  a topless woman may be socially or officially harassed or cited for public lewdness indecent exposure public indecency or disorderly conduct  topfreedom advocates seek to change community attitudes to breasts as sex objects or indecent several countries in europe have decriminalised nonsexual toplessness topless swimming and sunbathing on beaches has become acceptable in many parts of europe though the practice remains controversial in many places and not common in most places many public swimming pools in europe are owned by municipalities which are treated as private organisations and allowed to set their dress codes in many countries around the world breastfeeding in public is not unusual during 20062010 and earlier a number of news reports in the united states cited incidents where women were refused service or harassed for breastfeeding in public in response a majority of us states have passed laws explicitly permitting nursing in public    the united states federal government enacted a law in 1999  which specifically provides that a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a federal building or on federal property if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location however these laws generally do not apply to rules imposed by private organizations or on private property such as restaurants airlines or shopping malls in the united states states have primary jurisdiction in matters of public morality the topfreedom movement has claimed success in a few instances in persuading some state and federal courts to overturn some state laws on the basis of sex discrimination or equal protection arguing that a woman should be free to expose her chest in any context in which a man can expose his other successful cases have been on the basis of freedom of expression in protest or simply that exposure of breasts is not indecent or similar terminology a florida statute about indecent exposure prohibits the vulgar or indecent exposure of sexual organs but do not specify if female breasts are included as sexual organs but the right to breastfeed in public is expressly protected  and one florida court inferred that this exception indicates that female breasts are sexual organs  and the supreme court of florida held that a separate statute about disorderly conduct can be used to prosecute female toplessness   courts have rejected equal protection arguments the right of a woman to protest topless has been held to be a freedom of expression and not an equal protection issue  for example in 2007 a florida court acquitted a woman of indecent exposure for being topless on daytona beach because of the political nature of her stand under the first amendment right of free speech  topless bathing is tolerated on south beach along with a number of hotel pools in miami beach  in december 2007 50 residents of pittsfield massachusetts petitioned the city council requesting a segregated beach for topless sunbathing by both men and women the petition was rejected by the council with the mayor calling it unacceptable and unnecessary proponents of topless sunbathing vowed to continue their fight    in 2010 200 residents of pittsfield placed a question on the ballot asking whether state laws should be clarified to allow topless sunbathing equally for both men and women  the proposal was defeated 2934 to 6855  in 2008 jill coccaro aka phoenix feeley  of new york city see also new york below visited the beach at spring lake new jersey she did not wear a top and was arrested when she refused to cover up she was given a tshirt but left the police department and took it off and was arrested again  she was charged with violating a borough ordinance prohibiting public nudity she appealed the conviction to the state appeals court and the twojudge panelone man one womanruled against her  restrictions on the exposure of the female breast are supported by the important governmental interest in safeguarding the publics moral sensibilities the court cited state of new jersey v arlene vogt 2001 as precedent  in that case vogt was fined after she appeared on higbee beach in cape may county new jersey without a shirt  in the five years since she was found guilty and fined she appealed the case to the new jersey state appellate court who ruled against her the new jersey supreme court refused to hear her appeal  legally representing herself she then appealed to the united states supreme court but it too refused to hear her appeal  she would not pay the 816 fine telling judge george pappas i refuse to pay the fines for an act that is legal for a man but not legal for a woman the judge sentenced her to 16 days but she was released after only eight for good behavior ron taft a manhattan attorney offered to pay her fine but coccaro refused desiring to make a point she went on a hunger strike the gotopless group organized a protest outside the jail where coccaro was held  but only two individuals attended taft commented the point is there are guys with larger breasts than women and sometimes they take their top off   in 1986 seven women who picnicked topless were charged in rochester new york with baring that portion of the breast which is below the top of the areola  that law had originally been enacted to discourage topless waitresses the women were initially convicted but on appeal two of the womens charges were reversed by the new york state court of appeals in 1992 on equal protection grounds in santorellis case     the prementioned jill coccaro feeley was arrested in 2005 in new york city for walking along a street without wearing a shirt she sued the city for violating a new york state supreme court ruling in santorellis case  which had declared that women can go topless in public the city finally paid 29000 to settle her lawsuit the outdoor coed topless pulp fiction appreciation society has since 2011 organized regular gatherings around new york city of women who read books in public while topless  the objective of the group besides enjoying the sun and book reading is to create awareness that new york law allows toplessness in public and to change social attitudes to the exposure of breasts although participation has been very small there has been no harassment of the participants either by the police or the public holly van voast a bronx photographer and performance artist was detained arrested or issued summonses 10 times during 2011 and 2012 among other places she went topless on the staten island ferry  at the oyster bar in grand central terminal in front of an elementary school on a train and outside a hooters restaurant  after her arrest in front of the hooters police officers took her to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation on october 11 2011 she appeared in the midtown community court and promptly removed her top baring her breasts in front of the judge  all the charges were dismissed van voast filed a federal lawsuit on may 15 against the city and the police department  in february 2013 the new york city police department issued a command to all its officers through their daily roll call it reminded officers that they are not to cite or arrest a woman for public lewdness indecent exposure or any other section of the penal law for simply exposing their breasts in public  in 1972 the texas equal rights amendment was passed into law which communities in lewisville tx  and fort worth tx  have used to strike down gendered ordinances including toplessness however women in texas appearing topless in public can be charged under public nuisance laws  with the exception of austin the state capital where some women sunbathe topless in zilker park at various festivals and at hippie hollow   in 2013 lewisville txs nudity laws were updated to indicate that food staff must wear decent covering    other successful cases include in 1991 toplessness as an indecent act was challenged by gwen jacob in guelph ontario who removed her shirt and was charged with indecency part of her defence was the double standards between men and women although she was convicted this was overturned by the court of appeal  this case determined that being topless is not indecent under the meaning of the criminal code however it did not establish any constitutional right of equality this case subsequently led to the acquittal of women in british columbia and saskatchewan who faced similar charges although each province and territory technically reserves its right to interpret the law as it pleases the ontario case has proven influential since the matter has not been determined by the supreme court of canada it is still possible that a woman could be convicted elsewhere in canada but interpretation of moral law in canada has become increasingly liberalized  there do not appear to have been any further women charged in canada since these cases were determined in france the feminist collective les tumultueuses organized a topfree protest in paris in may 2009  in poland in 20082009 two women from szczecin including glamour model dorota krzysztofek  won a court battle that reasserted the womens right to sunbathe topless on public beaches  krzysztofek along with her female companion were fined by local municipal officials for topless sunbathing at a public recreation area the women refused to pay the fine and took the matter to civil court their first hearing had to be postponed due to remarkable media interest  on november 7 2008 judge szczepa\u0144ska upheld the city staff decision and charged the women with indecent exposure explaining that their personal freedoms cannot encroach on the freedoms of families with children who frequent the same recreation spot although topless sunbathing is not prohibited in poland the judge sentenced them to pay a fine of 230 zloty 150 zloty by different source  or 40 55 for breaking the rules of conduct in her rationale the judge also said that it is not up to the defendants to teach youngsters human anatomy however her decision was appealed by krzysztofeks female friend soon afterwards with the plea of not guilty   the appellate court declared both women to be innocent  because the city staff were unable to prove that anyone at the beach was indignant or scandalized by their toplessness and no complaint was ever reported on the contrary some visitors stood up to their defense there were no signs at the recreation area against what is otherwise legal  the appellate courts decision was binding but it also created an aura of ambivalence with topless sunbathing in public declared acceptable only if nobody else including families with children formally objects to it   in december 2007 a group of women and men calling themselves topless front swam topless in public swim baths to promote topless equality  in march 2008 after a yearlong campaign by the group copenhagens culture and leisure committee voted to allow topless bathing in its swimming pools  in sweden toplessness is not illegal however private or public establishments are permitted to establish dress codes which may require women to wear tops and deny access or remove individuals who breach these standards in september 2007 bara bröst a pun meaning both just breasts and bare breasts appeared to promote topless equality in these semipublic facilities the group staged several events in public swim baths in september and october 2007 starting in uppsala from which they were evicted several times before succeeding in sundsvall   the group scored a victory in june 2009 when the malmö citys sports and recreation committee approved new rules that while requiring everybody to wear bathing suits at indoor public swimming pools did not require women to cover their breasts   we dont define what bathing suits men should wear so it doesnt make much sense to do it for women and besides its not unusual for men to have large breasts that resemble womens breasts said a council spokesman  in order to supporting adda smaradottirs freethenipple act in public cyberspace  girls uploaded their topless photos to facebook and protested against its community standards  of considering womens breasts are sexual materials those photos and related news articles were blocked initially  but facebook considered those photos did not violate community standards

V the large intestine also called the colon or the large bowel is the last part of the digestive system in vertebrates water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation  terminologia anatomica medscape and grays anatomy define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum colon rectum and anal canal   other sources such as mosbys medical dictionary and the oxford dictionaries of medicine and biology exclude the anal canal    in humans it begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis just at or below the waist where it is joined to the end of the small intestine it then continues up the abdomen across the width of the abdominal cavity and then down to its endpoint at the anus overall in humans the large intestine is about 15 metres 49ft long which is about onefifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract    the colon is the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrates it extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which floraaided large bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs unlike the small intestine the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients about 15 litres or 45 ounces of water arrives in the colon each day  the length of the adult human colon is on average for women 155cm range of 80 to 214cm and for men 166cm range of 80 to 313cm  the average inner circumference of sections of the colon in centimeters with ranges in parentheses are cecum 87 80105 ascending colon 66 6070 transverse colon 58 5065 descendingsigmoid colon 63 6068 and rectum near rectalsigmoid junction 57 4575  in mammals the colon consists of four sections the ascending colon the transverse colon the descending colon and the sigmoid colon the proximal gut usually refers to the ascending colon and transverse colon and distal gut refers to the descending colon the cecum colon rectum and anal canal make up the large intestine  sections of the colon are the parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the retroperitoneum retroperitoneal organs in general do not have a complete covering of peritoneum so they are fixed in location intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile  of the colon the ascending colon descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal while the caecum appendix transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal  this is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery such as a laparotomy the cecum is the first section of the colon and involved in the digestion while the appendix which develops embryologically from it is a structure of the colon not involved in digestion and considered to be part of the gutassociated lymphoid tissue the function of the appendix is uncertain but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of the colons microflora and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction the ascending colon is one part of four sections of the large intestine this first section of the large intestine is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum the ascending colon runs through the abdominal cavity upwards toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches 20cm one of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it back into the body as the waste material exits the small intestine it will move into the cecum and then to the ascending colon where this process of extraction starts the unwanted waste material is moved upwards toward the transverse section of the colon by the action of peristalsis the ascending colon is sometimes attached to the appendix via gerlachs valve the appendix traditionally seen as a vestigial organ has been shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells in ruminants the ascending colon is known as the spiral colon  the cecum receives the solid wastes of digestion from the ileum via the ileocecal valve   the transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure the turn of the colon by the spleen the transverse colon hangs off the stomach attached to it by a large fold of peritoneum called the greater omentum on the posterior side the transverse colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the transverse mesocolon the transverse colon is encased in peritoneum and is therefore mobile unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after it cancers form more frequently further along the large intestine as the contents become more solid water is removed in order to form feces the proximal twothirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle colic artery a branch of the superior mesenteric artery sma while the latter third is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery ima the watershed area between these two blood supplies which represents the embryologic division between the midgut and hindgut is an area sensitive to ischemia the descending colon is the part of the colon from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon one function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store faeces that will be emptied into the rectum it is retroperitoneal in twothirds of humans in the other third it has a usually short mesentery the arterial supply comes via the left colic artery the descending colon is also called the distal gut as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut gut flora are very dense in this region the sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the rectum the name sigmoid means sshaped see sigmoid cf sigmoid sinus the walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular and contract to increase the pressure inside the colon causing the stool to move into the rectum the sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches usually between 2 and 6 of the sigmoid arteries a branch of the ima the ima terminates as the superior rectal artery sigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique used to examine the sigmoid colon rectum is the last section of the colon cecum  the first part of the large intestine the taenia coli run the length of the large intestine because the taenia coli are shorter than the large bowel itself the colon becomes sacculated forming the haustra of the colon which are the shelflike intraluminal projections  arterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric artery sma and inferior mesenteric artery ima flow between these two systems communicates via a marginal artery that runs parallel to the colon for its entire length historically it has been believed that the arc of riolan or the meandering mesenteric artery of moskowitz is a variable vessel connecting the proximal sma to the proximal ima that can be extremely important if either vessel is occluded however recent studies conducted with improved imaging technology have questioned the actual existence of this vessel with some experts calling for the abolition of the terms from future medical literature  venous drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply with the inferior mesenteric vein draining into the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein joining the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver lymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal twothirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes which drain into the cisterna chyli  the lymph from the distal onethird of the transverse colon the descending colon the sigmoid colon and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes  the lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal iliac nodes  the anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes  the pectinate line only roughly marks this transition one variation on the normal anatomy of the colon occurs when extra loops form resulting in a colon that is up to five metres longer than normal this condition referred to as redundant colon typically has no direct major health consequences though rarely volvulus occurs resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention   a significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope is difficult and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present though specialized variants on the instrument including the pediatric variant are useful in overcoming this problem  the wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelium with invaginations the invaginations are called the intestinal glands or colonic crypts the colon crypts are shaped like microscopic thick walled test tubes with a central hole down the length of the tube the crypt lumen four tissue sections are shown here two cut across the long axes of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes in these images the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brownorange color if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit i ccoi the nuclei of the cells located at the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts are stained bluegray with haematoxylin as seen in panels c and d crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long baker et al  found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells thus by the images shown here there are an average of about 1725 to 2530 cells per colonic crypt nooteboom et al  measuring the number of cells in a small number of crypts reported a range of 1500 to 4900 cells per colonic crypt cells are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before being shed into the colonic lumen days later  there are 5 to 6 stem cells at the bases of the crypts  as estimated from the image in panel a there are about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic epithelium  since the average length of the human colon is 1605cm  and the average inner circumference of the colon is 62cm  the inner surface epithelial area of the human colon has an average area of about 995 sq cm which includes 9950000 close to 10 million crypts in the four tissue sections shown here many of the intestinal glands have cells with a mitochondrial dna mutation in the ccoi gene and appear mostly white with their main color being the bluegray staining of the nuclei as seen in panel b a portion of the stem cells of three crypts appear to have a mutation in ccoi so that 40 to 50 of the cells arising from those stem cells form a white segment in the cross cut area overall the percent of crypts deficient for ccoi is less than 1 before age 40 but then increases linearly with age  colonic crypts deficient for ccoi in women reaches on average 18 in women and 23 in men by 8084 years of age  crypts of the colon can reproduce by fission as seen in panel c where a crypt is fissioning to form two crypts and in panel b where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning most crypts deficient in ccoi are in clusters of crypts clones of crypts with two or more ccoideficient crypts adjacent to each other see panel d  the large intestine takes about 16 hours to finish the digestion of the food it removes water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the indigestible matter to the rectum the colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the colonic bacteria such as vitamin k especially important as the daily ingestion of vitamin k is not normally enough to maintain adequate blood coagulation vitamin b12 thiamine and riboflavin it also compacts feces and stores fecal matter in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation the large intestine also secretes k and cl chloride secretion increases in cystic fibrosis recycling of various nutrients takes place in colon examples include fermentation of carbohydrates short chain fatty acids and urea cycling  the large intestine differs in physical form from the small intestine in being much wider and in showing the longitudinal layer of the muscularis have been reduced to 3 straplike structures known as the taeniae coli the wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelium instead of having the evaginations of the small intestine villi the large intestine has invaginations the intestinal glands while both the small intestine and the large intestine have goblet cells they are abundant in the large intestine  the appendix is attached to the inferior surface of the cecum and contains a small amount of mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue which gives the appendix an undetermined role in immunity however the appendix is known to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and development  the appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence to the patient  the large intestine extends from the ileocecal junction to the anus and is about 15m long on the surface bands of longitudinal muscle fibers called taeniae coli each about 15in wide can be identified there are three bands and they start at the base of the appendix and extend from the cecum to the rectum along the sides of the taeniae tags of peritoneum filled with fat called epiploic appendages or appendices epiploicae are found the sacculations called haustra are characteristic features of the large intestine and distinguish it from the small intestine  the large intestine comes after the small intestine in the digestive tract and measures approximately 15 meters in length in adult humans there are differences in the large intestine between different organisms the large intestine is mainly responsible for storing waste reclaiming water maintaining the water balance absorbing some vitamins such as vitamin k and providing a location for floraaided fermentation by the time the chyme has reached this tube most nutrients and 90 of the water have been absorbed by the body at this point some electrolytes like sodium magnesium and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food eg a large part of ingested amylose starch which has been shielded from digestion heretofore and dietary fiber which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form as the chyme moves through the large intestine most of the remaining water is removed while the chyme is mixed with mucus and bacteria known as gut flora and becomes feces the ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid the muscles of the colon then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess water the stools gradually solidify as they move along into the descending colon  the bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment and create acetate propionate and butyrate as waste products which in turn are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment  no protein is made available in humans perhaps 10 of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes available though this may vary with diet  in other animals including other apes and primates who have proportionally larger colons more is made available thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet the large intestine produces no digestive enzymes  chemical digestion is completed in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine the ph in the colon varies between 55 and 7 slightly acidic to neutral  water absorption at the colon typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient the standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines this hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries the large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that perform a variety of functions as well as fungi protozoa and archaea species diversity varies by geography and diet  the microbes in a human distal gut often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion and can weigh around 200 grams 044 pounds this mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called the latest human organ to be discovered or in other words the forgotten organ  the large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria inhabiting this region undigested polysaccharides fiber are metabolized to shortchain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by passive diffusion the bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty acids  these bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins especially vitamin k and biotin a b vitamin for absorption into the blood although this source of vitamins in general provides only a small part of the daily requirement it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low an individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large intestine may become vitamindeficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit other species of bacteria as well as the diseasecausing bacteria  other bacterial products include gas flatus which is a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide with small amounts of the gases hydrogen methane and hydrogen sulfide bacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides produces these some of the fecal odor is due to indoles metabolized from the amino acid tryptophan the normal flora is also essential in the development of certain tissues including the cecum and lymphatics  they are also involved in the production of crossreactive antibodies these are antibodies produced by the immune system against the normal flora that are also effective against related pathogens thereby preventing infection or invasion the most prevalent bacteria are the bacteroides which have been implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer bifidobacteria are also abundant and are often described as friendly bacteria  a mucus layer protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal bacteria  following are the most common diseases or disorders of the colon colonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and the distal part of the small bowel with a ccd camera or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus it can provide a visual diagnosis eg ulceration polyps and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less once polyps are removed they can be studied with the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not it takes 15 years or fewer for a polyp to turn cancerous colonoscopy is similar to sigmoidoscopythe difference being related to which parts of the colon each can examine a colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon 12001500mm in length a sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion about 600mm of the colon which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion of the colon    a sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening procedure for a full colonoscopy often done in conjunction with a fecal occult blood test fobt about 5 of these screened patients are referred to colonoscopy  virtual colonoscopy which uses 2d and 3d imagery reconstructed from computed tomography ct scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance mr scans is also possible as a totally noninvasive medical test although it is not standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities furthermore virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyptumour removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters if a growth or polyp is detected using ct colonography a standard colonoscopy would still need to be performed additionally surgeons have lately been using the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileoanal pouch the large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods in which it is almost always separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal valve in most vertebrates however it is a relatively short structure running directly to the anus although noticeably wider than the small intestine although the caecum is present in most amniotes only in mammals does the remainder of the large intestine develop into a true colon  in some small mammals the colon is straight as it is in other tetrapods but in the majority of mammalian species it is divided into ascending and descending portions a distinct transverse colon is typically present only in primates however the taeniae coli and accompanying haustra are not found in either carnivorans or ruminants the rectum of mammals other than monotremes is derived from the cloaca of other vertebrates and is therefore not truly homologous with the rectum found in these species  in fish there is no true large intestine but simply a short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca in sharks this includes a rectal gland that secretes salt to help the animal maintain osmotic balance with the seawater the gland somewhat resembles a caecum in structure but is not a homologous structure  intestines scheme colon deep dissection anterior view this article incorporates text in

V the calcar avis previously known as the hippocampus minor is an involution of the wall of the lateral ventricles posterior cornu produced by the calcarine fissure  it is sometimes visible on ultrasonogram  and can resemble a clot  the ridge was originally described by anatomists as the calcar avis while the ridge running along the floor of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle was described by various names in particular as the hippocampus a classical allusion was introduced later with the term pes hippocampi which may date back to diemerbroeck in 1672 introducing a comparison with the shape of the folded back forelimbs and webbed feet of the classical hippocampus greek \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 a sea monster with a horses forequarters and a fishs tail at a subsequent stage the hippocampus was described as pes hippocampi major with the calcar avis being named pes hippocampi minor  the renaming of the hippocampus as hippocampus major and the calcar avis as hippocampus minor has been attributed to félix vicqdazyr systematising nomenclature of parts of the brain in 1786 while hippocampus minor was used interchangeably with calcar avis for much of the 19th century for a few years after 1861 the former name was subjected to publicity and ridicule when the hippocampus minor became the centre of a dispute over human evolution between thomas henry huxley and richard owen satirised as the great hippocampus question the term hippocampus minor fell from use in anatomy textbooks and was officially removed in the nomina anatomica of 1895 but still featured in the encyclopædia britannica of 1926 and appeared in general dictionaries as late as 1957  human brain right dissected lateral view this article incorporates text in the public domain from the 20th edition of grays anatomy 1918

V cardiac physiology or heart function is the study of healthy unimpaired function of the heart involving blood flow myocardium structure the electrical conduction system of the heart the cardiac cycle and cardiac output and how these interact and depend on one another   the heart functions as a pump and acts as a double pump in the cardiovascular system to provide a continuous circulation of blood throughout the body this circulation includes the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation both circuits transport blood but they can also be seen in terms of the gases they carry the pulmonary circulation collects oxygen from the lungs and delivers carbon dioxide for exhalationthe systemic circuit transports oxygen to the body and returns relatively deoxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the pulmonary circuit  blood flows through the heart in one direction from the atria to the ventricles and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation and the aorta into the systemic circulation the pulmonary artery also trunk branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries to supply each lung blood is prevented from flowing backwards regurgitation by the tricuspid bicuspid aortic and pulmonary valves the function of the right heart is to collect deoxygenated blood in the right atrium from the body via the superior and inferior venae cavae and pump it through the tricuspid valve via the right ventricle through the semilunar pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery in the pulmonary circulation where carbon dioxide can be exchanged for oxygen in the lungsthis happens through the passive process of diffusion in the left heart oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein it is then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation eventually in the systemic capillaries exchange with the tissue fluid and cells of the body occurs oxygen and nutrients are supplied to the cells for their metabolism and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products  in this case oxygen and nutrients exit the systemic capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic processes and carbon dioxide and waste products will enter the blood  the ventricles are stronger and thicker than the atria and the muscle wall surrounding the left ventricle is thicker than the wall surrounding the right ventricle due to the higher force needed to pump the blood through the systemic circulation atria facilitate circulation primarily by allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart preventing the inertia of interrupted venous flow that would otherwise occur at each ventricular systole  cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate  spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart this autorhythmicity is still modulated by the endocrine and nervous systems  there are two types of cardiac muscle cell cardiomyocytes which have the ability to contract easily and modified cardiomyocytes the pacemaker cells of the conducting system the cardiomyocytes make up the bulk 99 of cells in the atria and ventricles these contractile cells respond to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells and are responsible for the contractions that pump blood through the body the pacemaker cells make up just 1 of cells and form the conduction system of the heart they are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few of the myofibrils or myofilaments which means that have limited contractibility their function is similar in many respects to neurons  the bundle of his and purkinje fibres are specialised cardiomyocytes that function in the conduction system cardiomyocytes are considerably shorter and have smaller diameters than skeletal myocytes cardiac muscle like skeletal muscle is characterized by striations  the stripes of dark and light bands resulting from the organised arrangement of myofilaments and myofibrils in the sarcomere along the length of the cell t transverse tubules are deep invaginations from the sarcolemma cell membrane that penetrate the cell allowing the electrical impulses to reach the interior in cardiac muscle the ttubules are only found at the zlines  when an action potential causes cells to contract calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the cells as well as the t tubules the calcium release triggers sliding of the actin and myosin fibrils leading to contraction  a plentiful supply of mitochondria provide the energy for the contractions typically cardiomyocytes have a single central nucleus but can also have two or more  cardiac muscle cells branch freely and are connected by junctions known as intercalated discs which help the synchronized contraction of the muscle  the sarcolemma membrane from adjacent cells bind together at the intercalated discs they consist of desmosomes specialized linking proteoglycans tight junctions and large numbers of gap junctions that allow the passage of ions between the cells and help to synchronize the contraction intercellular connective tissue also helps to strongly bind the cells together in order to withstand the forces of contraction  cardiac muscle undergoes aerobic respiration patterns primarily metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates oxygen from the lungs attaches to haemoglobin and is also stored in the myoglobin so that a plentiful supply of oxygen is available lipids and glycogen are also stored within the sarcoplasm and these are broken down by mitochondria to release atp the cells undergo twitchtype contractions with long refractory periods followed by brief relaxation periods when the heart fills with blood for the next cycle  it is not very well known how the electric signal moves in the atria it seems that it moves in a radial way but bachmanns bundle and coronary sinus muscle play a role in conduction between the two atria which have a nearly simultaneous systole    while in the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the myocardium  if embryonic heart cells are separated into a petri dish and kept alive each is capable of generating its own electrical impulse followed by contraction when two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle cells are placed together the cell with the higher inherent rate sets the pace and the impulse spreads from the faster to the slower cell to trigger a contraction as more cells are joined together the fastest cell continues to assume control of the rate a fully developed adult heart maintains the capability of generating its own electrical impulse triggered by the fastest cells as part of the cardiac conduction system the components of the cardiac conduction system include the atrial and ventricular syncytium the sinoatrial node the atrioventricular node the bundle of his atrioventricular bundle the bundle branches and the purkinje cells  normal sinus rhythm is established by the sinoatrial sa node the hearts pacemaker the sa node is a specialized grouping of cardiomyocytes in the upper and back walls of the right atrium very close to the opening of the superior vena cava the sa node has the highest rate of depolarization  this impulse spreads from its initiation in the sa node throughout the atria through specialized internodal pathways to the atrial myocardial contractile cells and the atrioventricular node the internodal pathways consist of three bands anteriormiddle and posterior that lead directly from the sa node to the next node in the conduction system the atrioventricular node the impulse takes approximately 50 ms milliseconds to travel between these two nodes the relative importance of this pathway has been debated since the impulse would reach the atrioventricular node simply following the cellbycell pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in the atria in addition there is a specialized pathway called bachmanns bundle or the interatrial band that conducts the impulse directly from the right atrium to the left atrium regardless of the pathway as the impulse reaches the atrioventricular septum the connective tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the atrioventricular node  the electrical event the wave of depolarization is the trigger for muscular contraction the wave of depolarization begins in the right atrium and the impulse spreads across the superior portions of both atria and then down through the contractile cells the contractile cells then begin contraction from the superior to the inferior portions of the atria efficiently pumping blood into the ventricles  the atrioventricular av node is a second cluster of specialized myocardial conductive cells located in the inferior portion of the right atrium within the atrioventricular septum the septum prevents the impulse from spreading directly to the ventricles without passing through the av node there is a critical pause before the av node depolarizes and transmits the impulse to the atrioventricular bundle this delay in transmission is partially attributable to the small diameter of the cells of the node which slow the impulse also conduction between nodal cells is less efficient than between conducting cells these factors mean that it takes the impulse approximately 100 ms to pass through the node this pause is critical to heart function as it allows the atrial cardiomyocytes to complete their contraction that pumps blood into the ventricles before the impulse is transmitted to the cells of the ventricle itself with extreme stimulation by the sa node the av node can transmit impulses maximally at 220 per minute this establishes the typical maximum heart rate in a healthy young individual damaged hearts or those stimulated by drugs can contract at higher rates but at these rates the heart can no longer effectively pump blood  arising from the av node the bundle of his proceeds through the interventricular septum before dividing into two bundle branches commonly called the left and right bundle branches the left bundle branch has two fascicles the left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle and the right bundle branch the right ventricle since the left ventricle is much larger than the right the left bundle branch is also considerably larger than the right portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles because of this connection each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time so they begin to contract simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles this is believed to allow tension to develop on the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction there is no corresponding moderator band on the left both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the purkinje fibers this passage takes approximately 25 ms  the purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cells in the ventricles they extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum and the base of the heart the purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate and the electrical impulse reaches all of the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom this allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk the total time elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the sa node until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms  action potentials are considerably different between conductive and contractive cardiomyocytes while sodium na  and potassium k  ions play essential roles calcium ions ca  are also critical for both types of cell unlike skeletal muscles and neurons cardiac conductive cells do not have a stable resting potential conductive cells contain a series of sodium ion channels that allow a normal and slow influx of sodium ions that causes the membrane potential to rise slowly from an initial value of 60 mv up to about 40 mv the resulting movement of sodium ions creates spontaneous depolarization or prepotential depolarization  at this point calcium channels open and ca  enters the cell further depolarizing it at a more rapid rate until it reaches a value of approximately 5 mv at this point the calcium ion channels close and potassium channels open allowing outflux of k  and resulting in repolarization when the membrane potential reaches approximately 60 mv the k  channels close and na  channels open and the prepotential phase begins again this process gives the autorhythmicity to cardiac muscle  there is a distinctly different electrical pattern involving the contractile cells in this case there is a rapid depolarization followed by a plateau phase and then repolarization this phenomenon accounts for the long refractory periods required for the cardiac muscle cells to pump blood effectively before they are capable of firing for a second time these cardiac myocytes normally do not initiate their own electrical potential although they are capable of doing so but rather wait for an impulse to reach them  contractile cells demonstrate a much more stable resting phase than conductive cells at approximately 80 mv for cells in the atria and 90 mv for cells in the ventricles despite this initial difference the other components of their action potentials are virtually identical in both cases when stimulated by an action potential voltagegated channels rapidly open beginning the positivefeedback mechanism of depolarization this rapid influx of positively charged ions raises the membrane potential to approximately 30 mv at which point the sodium channels close the rapid depolarization period typically lasts 35 ms depolarization is followed by the plateau phase in which membrane potential declines relatively slowly this is due in large part to the opening of the slow ca  channels allowing ca  to enter the cell while few k  channels are open allowing k  to exit the cell the relatively long plateau phase lasts approximately 175 ms once the membrane potential reaches approximately zero the ca  channels close and k  channels open allowing k  to exit the cell the repolarization lasts approximately 75 ms at this point membrane potential drops until it reaches resting levels once more and the cycle repeats the entire event lasts between 250 and 300 ms  the absolute refractory period for cardiac contractile muscle lasts approximately 200 ms and the relative refractory period lasts approximately 50 ms for a total of 250 ms this extended period is critical since the heart muscle must contract to pump blood effectively and the contraction must follow the electrical events without extended refractory periods premature contractions would occur in the heart and would not be compatible with life  calcium ions play two critical roles in the physiology of cardiac muscle their influx through slow calcium channels accounts for the prolonged plateau phase and absolute refractory period calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein troponin in the troponin complex both roles enabling the myocardium to function properly  approximately 20 percent of the calcium required for contraction is supplied by the influx of ca  during the plateau phase the remaining ca  for contraction is released from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum  the pattern of prepotential or spontaneous depolarization followed by rapid depolarization and repolarization just described are seen in the sa node and a few other conductive cells in the heart since the sa node is the pacemaker it reaches threshold faster than any other component of the conduction system it will initiate the impulses spreading to the other conducting cells the sa node without nervous or endocrine control would initiate a heart impulse approximately 80100 times per minute although each component of the conduction system is capable of generating its own impulse the rate progressively slows from the sa node to the purkinje fibers without the sa node the av node would generate a heart rate of 4060 beats per minute if the av node were blocked the atrioventricular bundle would fire at a rate of approximately 3040 impulses per minute the bundle branches would have an inherent rate of 2030 impulses per minute and the purkinje fibers would fire at 1520 impulses per minute while a few exceptionally trained aerobic athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in the range of 3040 beats per minute the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per minute for miguel indurain a cyclistfor most individuals rates lower than 50 beats per minute would indicate a condition called bradycardia depending upon the specific individual as rates fall much below this level the heart would be unable to maintain adequate flow of blood to vital tissues initially resulting in decreasing loss of function across the systems unconsciousness and ultimately death  the period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as the cardiac cycle the period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called systole the period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is called diastole both the atria and ventricles undergo systole and diastole and it is essential that these components be carefully regulated and coordinated to ensure blood is pumped efficiently to the body  fluids move from regions of high pressure to regions of lower pressure accordingly when the heart chambers are relaxed diastole blood will flow into the atria from the higher pressure of the veins as blood flows into the atria the pressure will rise so the blood will initially move passively from the atria into the ventricles when the action potential triggers the muscles in the atria to contract atrial systole the pressure within the atria rises further pumping blood into the ventricles during ventricular systole pressure rises in the ventricles pumping blood into the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricle and into the aorta from the left ventricle  at the beginning of the cardiac cycle both the atria and ventricles are relaxed diastole blood is flowing into the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus blood flows into the left atrium from the four pulmonary veins the two atrioventricular valves the tricuspid and mitral valves are both open so blood flows unimpeded from the atria and into the ventricles approximately 7080 percent of ventricular filling occurs by this method the two semilunar valves the pulmonary and aortic valves are closed preventing backflow of blood into the right and left ventricles from the pulmonary trunk on the right and the aorta on the left  contraction of the atria follows depolarization represented by the p wave of the ecg as the atrial muscles contract from the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum pressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular tricuspid and mitral or bicuspid valves at the start of atrial systole the ventricles are normally filled with approximately 7080 percent of their capacity due to inflow during diastole atrial contraction also referred to as the atrial kick contributes the remaining 2030 percent of filling atrial systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole as the atrial muscle returns to diastole  ventricular systole follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the qrs complex in the ecg it may be conveniently divided into two phases lasting a total of 270 ms at the end of atrial systole and just prior to atrial contraction the ventricles contain approximately 130 ml blood in a resting adult in a standing position this volume is known as the end diastolic volume edv or preload  initially as the muscles in the ventricle contract the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises but it is not yet high enough to open the semilunar pulmonary and aortic valves and be ejected from the heart however blood pressure quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole this increase in pressure causes blood to flow back toward the atria closing the tricuspid and mitral valves since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early stage the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant consequently this initial phase of ventricular systole is known as isovolumic contraction also called isovolumetric contraction  in the second phase of ventricular systole the ventricular ejection phase the contraction of the ventricular muscle has raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the aorta blood is pumped from the heart pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves pressure generated by the left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle since the existing pressure in the aorta will be so much higher nevertheless both ventricles pump the same amount of blood this quantity is referred to as stroke volume stroke volume will normally be in the range of 7080 ml since ventricular systole began with an edv of approximately 130 ml of blood this means that there is still 5060 ml of blood remaining in the ventricle following contraction this volume of blood is known as the end systolic volume esv  ventricular relaxation or diastole follows repolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the t wave of the ecg it too is divided into two distinct phases and lasts approximately 430 ms  during the early phase of ventricular diastole as the ventricular muscle relaxes pressure on the remaining blood within the ventricle begins to fall when pressure within the ventricles drops below pressure in both the pulmonary trunk and aorta blood flows back toward the heart producing the dicrotic notch small dip seen in blood pressure tracings the semilunar valves close to prevent backflow into the heart since the atrioventricular valves remain closed at this point there is no change in the volume of blood in the ventricle so the early phase of ventricular diastole is called the isovolumic ventricular relaxation phase also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation phase  in the second phase of ventricular diastole called late ventricular diastole as the ventricular muscle relaxes pressure on the blood within the ventricles drops even further eventually it drops below the pressure in the atria when this occurs blood flows from the atria into the ventricles pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves as pressure drops within the ventricles blood flows from the major veins into the relaxed atria and from there into the ventricles both chambers are in diastole the atrioventricular valves are open and the semilunar valves remain closed the cardiac cycle is complete  one of the simplest methods of assessing the hearts condition is to listen to it using a stethoscope  in a healthy heart there are only two audible heart sounds called s1 and s2 the first heart sound s1 is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as lub the second heart sound s2 is the sound of the semilunar valves closing during ventricular diastole and is described as dub  each sound consists of two components reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close  s2 may split into two distinct sounds either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems  additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to gallop rhythms a third heart sound s3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume a fourth heart sound s4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle the combined presence of s3 and s4 give a quadruple gallop  heart murmurs are abnormal heart sounds which can be either pathological or benign and there are numerous kinds  murmurs are graded by volume from 1 the quietest to 6 the loudest and evaluated by their relationship to the heart sounds and position in the cardiac cycle  phonocardiograms can record these sounds  murmurs can result from narrowing stenosis regurgitation or insufficiency of any of the main heart valves but they can also result from a number of other disorders including atrial and ventricular septal defects  one example of a murmur is stills murmur which presents a musical sound in children has no symptoms and disappears in adolescence  a different type of sound a pericardial friction rub can be heard in cases of pericarditis where the inflamed membranes can rub together  the resting heart rate of a newborn can be 120 beats per minute bpm and this gradually decreases until maturity and then gradually increases again with age the adult resting heart rate ranges from 60100 bpm exercise and fitness levels age and basal metabolic rate can all affect the heart rate an athletes heart rate can be lower than 60bpm during exercise the rate can be 150bpm with maximum rates reaching from 200 and 220 bpm  the normal sinus rhythm of the heart rate is generated by the sa node it is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves   of the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata activity is increased via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves and inhibited via parasympathetic stimulation by the vagus nerve during rest vagal stimulation normally predominates as left unregulated the sa node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm  both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli flow through the paired cardiac plexus near the base of the heart without any nervous stimulation the sa node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm since resting rates are considerably less than this it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows hr  the cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers forming the cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia t1t4 to both the sa and av nodes plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles the ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine also known as noradrenaline at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves this shortens the repolarization period thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction which results in an increased heartrate it opens chemical or ligandgated sodium and calcium ion channels allowing an influx of positively charged ions  norepinephrine binds to the beta1 receptor high blood pressure medications are used to block these receptors and so reduce the heart rate  the cardiovascular centres receive input from a series of visceral receptors with impulses traveling through visceral sensory fibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus among these receptors are various proprioreceptors baroreceptors and chemoreceptors plus stimuli from the limbic system which normally enable the precise regulation of heart function via cardiac reflexes increased physical activity results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles joint capsules and tendons the cardiovascular centres monitor these increased rates of firing suppressing parasympathetic stimulation or increasing sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase blood flow  similarly baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus carotid bodies the venae cavae and other locations including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure level of physical activity and the relative distribution of blood the cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex with increased pressure and stretch the rate of baroreceptor firing increases and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation as pressure and stretch decrease the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation  there is a similar reflex called the atrial reflex or bainbridge reflex associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located however as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase hr the opposite is also true  in addition to the autonomic nervous system other factors can impact on this these include epinephrine norepinephrine and thyroid hormones levels of various ions including calcium potassium and sodium body temperature hypoxia and ph balance   factors that increase heart rate also trigger an increase in stroke volume as with skeletal muscles the heart can increase in size and efficiency with exercise  thus endurance athletes such as marathon runners may have a heart that has hypertrophied by up to 40   the difference between maximum and minimum cardiac outputs is known as the cardiac reserve and this measures the residual capacity to pump blood  heart rates may reach up to 185195 in exercise depending on how fit a person is  cardiac output co is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle stroke volume sv in one minute to calculate this multiply stroke volume sv by heart rate hr in beats per minute  it can be represented by the equation co  hr x sv  sv is normally measured using an echocardiogram to record end diastolic volume edv and end systolic volume esv and calculating the difference sv  edv  esv sv can also be measured using a specialized catheter but this is an invasive procedure and far more dangerous to the patient a mean sv for a resting 70kg 150lb individual would be approximately 70 ml there are several important variables including size of the heart physical and mental condition of the individual sex contractility duration of contraction preload or edv and afterload or resistance normal range for sv would be 55100 ml an average resting hr would be approximately 75 bpm but could range from 60100 in some individuals  using these numbers which refer to each ventricle not both the mean co is 525 lmin with a range of 4080 lmin  svs are also used to calculate ejection fraction which is the portion of the blood that is pumped or ejected from the heart with each contraction to calculate ejection fraction sv is divided by edv despite the name the ejection fraction is normally expressed as a percentage ejection fractions range from approximately 5570 percent with a mean of 58 percent  many of the factors that regulate the heart rate also have an impact on cardiac function by altering the stroke volume while a number of variables are involved stroke volume is dependent upon the difference between end diastolic volume and end systolic volume the three primary factors involved are preload afterload and contractility  preload is another way of expressing edv therefore the greater the edv the greater the preload a main factor is ventricular filling time the faster the contractions are the shorter the filling time and both the edv and preload are lower  the relationship between ventricular stretch and contraction has been stated in the frankstarling mechanism which says that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fibre so that the greater the stretch of the ventricle the greater the contraction any sympathetic stimulation to the venous system will increase venous return to the heart and ventricular filling  the ventricles must develop a certain tension to pump blood against the resistance of the vascular system this tension is called afterload when the resistance is increased particularly due to stenotic valve damage the afterload must necessarily increase a decrease in normal vascular resistance can also occur different cardiac responses operate to restore homeostasis of the pressure and blood flow  the ability of the myocardium to contract its contractility controls the stroke volume which determines the end systolic volume the greater the contraction the greater the stroke volume and the smaller the end systolic volume positive or negative inotropic factors via sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation respectively can increase or decrease the force of contractions sympathetic stimulation triggers the release of norepinephrine from the cardiac nerves and also stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete both epinephrine and norepinephrine these secretions increase the heart rate subsequent metabolic rate and contractility parasympathetic stimulation stimulates the release of acetylcholine ach from the vagus nerve which decreases contractility and stroke volume which increases end systolic volume several synthetic drugs have been developed that can act either as a stimulant or inhibitor inotrope the stimulant inotropes such as digoxin cause higher concentrations of calcium ions which increase contractility excess calcium hypercalcemia is also a positive inotrope drugs that are negative inotropes include beta blockers and calcium channel blockers hypoxia acidosis hyperkalemia are also negative inotropic agents

V the appendix or vermiform appendix also cecal or caecal appendix vermix or vermiform process is a blindended tube connected to the cecum from which it develops embryologically the cecum is a pouchlike structure of the colon located at the junction of the small and the large intestines the term vermiform comes from latin and means wormshaped   the human appendix averages 9cm in length but can range from 2 to 20cm the diameter of the appendix is usually between 7 and 8mm the longest appendix ever removed was 26cm long it was removed from a patient in zagreb croatia  the appendix is usually located in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen near the right hip bone the base of the appendix is located 2cm beneath the ileocecal valve that separates the large intestine from the small intestine its position within the abdomen corresponds to a point on the surface known as mcburneys point the appendix is connected to the mesentery in the lower region of the ileum by a short tube known as the mesoappendix  some identical twinsknown as mirror image twinscan have a mirrorimaged anatomy a congenital condition with the appendix located in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen    intestinal malrotation may also cause displacement of the appendix to the left side while the base of the appendix is at a fairly constant location2cm below the ileocecal valve the tip of the appendix can be variably locatedin the pelvis outside the peritoneum or behind the cecum  the prevalence of the different positions varies amongst populations with the retrocecal position being most common in ghana and sudan with 673 and 583 occurrence respectively in comparison to iran and bosnia where the pelvic position is most common with 558 and 577 occurrence respectively     in very rare cases laparotomies for suspected appendicitis have given a frequency of 1 in 100000 the appendix may not be present at all  sometimes there is a semicircular fold of mucous membrane at the opening of the appendix this valve of the vermiform appendix is also called gerlachs valve  although it has been long accepted that the immune tissue surrounding the appendix and elsewhere in the gutcalled gut associated lymphoid tissuecarries out a number of important functions explanations were lacking for the distinctive shape of the appendix and its apparent lack of specific importance and function as judged by an absence of side effects following appendectomy  william parker randy bollinger and colleagues at duke university proposed in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria from the rest of the intestines   this proposal is based on a new understanding of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria   in combination with many wellknown features of the appendix including its architecture its location just below the normal oneway flow of food and germs in the large intestine and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue research performed at winthrop universityhospital showed that individuals without an appendix were four times more likely to have a recurrence of clostridium difficile colitis  the appendix therefore may act as a safe house for commensal good bacteria this reservoir of gut flora could then serve to repopulate the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera  the appendix has more recently been identified as an important component of mammalian mucosal immune function particularly blymphocytemediated immune responses and extrathymically derived tlymphocytes this structure helps in the proper movement and removal of waste matter in the digestive system contains lymphatic vessels that regulate pathogens and lastly might even produce early defences that prevent deadly diseases additionally it is thought that this may provide more immune defences from invading pathogens and getting the lymphatic systems b and tcells to fight the viruses and bacteria that infect that portion of the bowel and training them so that immune responses are targeted and more able to reliably and less dangerously fight off pathogens  the human appendix had been proposed to be a vestigial structure a structure that has lost all or most of its original function or a structure that has evolved to take on a new function the vermiform appendix has been proposed to be the shrunken remainder of the cecum that was found in a remote ancestor of humans a 2013 study however refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and presence  ceca which occur in the digestive tracts of many herbivores eg ox horse house mutualistic bacteria and ingested small stones that help animals digest the cellulose molecules found in plants  it is widely present in euarchontoglires a superorder of mammals that includes rodents and primates and has also evolved independently in the diprotodont marsupials monotremes and is highly diverse in size and shape   a possible scenario for the progression from a fully functional cecum to the current human appendix was put forth by charles darwin  he suggested that the appendix was used for digesting leaves as primates it may be a vestigial organ of ancient humans that has degraded to nearly nothing of its original purpose or evolved to take on a new purpose over the course of evolution the very long cecum of some herbivorous animals such as found in the horse or the koala appears to support this theory the koalas cecum enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to break down cellulose human ancestors may have also relied upon this system when they lived on a diet rich in foliage as people began to eat more easily digested foods they may have become less reliant on celluloserich plants for energy as the cecum became less necessary for digestion mutations that were previously deleterious and would have hindered evolutionary progress were no longer important so the mutations survived it is suggested that these alleles became more frequent and the cecum continued to shrink after millions of years the oncenecessary cecum degraded to be the appendix of modern humans  the most common diseases of the appendix in humans are appendicitis and carcinoid tumors appendiceal carcinoid  appendix cancer accounts for about 1 in 200 of all gastrointestinal malignancies in rare cases adenomas are also present  appendicitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the appendix pain often begins in the center of the abdomen corresponding to the appendixs development as part of the embryonic midgut this pain is typically a dull poorly localized visceral pain  as the inflammation progresses the pain begins to localize more clearly to the right lower quadrant as the peritoneum becomes inflamed this peritoneal inflammation or peritonitis results in rebound tenderness pain upon removal of pressure rather than application of pressure in particular it presents at mcburneys point 13 of the way along a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus typically point skin pain is not present until the parietal peritoneum is inflamed as well fever and an immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis  appendicitis usually requires the removal of the inflamed appendix in an appendectomy either by laparotomy or laparoscopy untreated the appendix may rupture leading to peritonitis followed by shock and if still untreated death  the surgical removal of the vermiform appendix is called an appendectomy this removal is normally performed as an emergency procedure when the patient is suffering from acute appendicitis in the absence of surgical facilities intravenous antibiotics are used to delay or avoid the onset of sepsis in some cases the appendicitis resolves completely more often an inflammatory mass forms around the appendix this is a relative contraindication to surgery the appendix is also used for the construction of an efferent urinary conduit in an operation known as the mitrofanoff procedure  in people with a neurogenic bladder the appendix is also used as a means to access the colon in children with paralysed bowels or major rectal sphincter problems the appendix is brought out to the skin surface and the childparent can then attach a catheter and easily wash out the colon via normal defaecation using an appropriate solution  dr heather f smith of arizona state university explained recently  improved understanding of gut immunity has merged with current thinking in biological and medical science pointing to an apparent function of the mammalian cecal appendix as a safehouse for symbiotic gut microbes preserving the flora during times of gastrointestinal infection in societies without modern medicine this function is potentially a selective force for the evolution and maintenance of the appendix three morphotypes of cecalappendices can be described among mammals based primarily on the shape of the cecum a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or saclike cecum as in many primate species an appendix located at the apex of a long and voluminous cecum as in the rabbit greater glider and cape dune mole rat and an appendix in the absence of a pronounced cecum as in the wombat in addition long narrow appendixlike structures are found in mammals that either lack an apparent cecum as in monotremes or lack a distinct junction between the cecum and appendixlike structure as in the koala a cecal appendix has evolved independently at least twice and apparently represents yet another example of convergence in morphology between australian marsupials and placentals in the rest of the world although the appendix has apparently been lost by numerous species it has also been maintained for more than 80 million years in at least one clade  in a more recent paper the appendix was found to have evolved at least 32 times and perhaps as many as 38 times and to have been lost no more than six times  this suggests that the cecal appendix has a selective advantage in many situations and argues strongly against its vestigial nature this complex evolutionary history of the appendix along with a great heterogeneity in its evolutionary rate in various taxa suggests that it is a recurrent trait  such a function may be useful in a culture lacking modern sanitation and healthcare practice where diarrhea may be prevalent current epidemiological data on the cause of death in developed countries collected by the world health organization in 2001 show that acute diarrhea is now the fourth leading cause of diseaserelated death in developing countries data summarized by the bill and melinda gates foundation two of the other leading causes of death are expected to have exerted limited or no selection pressure   illustration depicting the location of the appendix in a child normal location of the appendix relative to other

V artificial skin refers to a collagen scaffold that induces regeneration of skin in mammals the term was used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe a new treatment for massive burns it was later discovered that treatment of deep skin wounds in adult animals and humans with this scaffold induces regeneration of the dermis it has been developed commercially under the name integratm and is used in massively burned patients during plastic surgery of the skin and in treatment of chronic skin wounds alternatively the term artificial skin sometimes is used to refer to skinlike tissue grown in a laboratory although this technology is still quite a way away from being viable for use in the medical field artificial skin can also refer to flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs also experimental   the skin is the largest organ in the human body  skin is made up of three layers the epidermis dermis and the fat layer also called the hypodermis the epidermis is the outer layer of skin that keeps vital fluids in and harmful bacteria out of the body the dermis is the inner layer of skin that contains blood vessels nerves hair follicles oil and sweat glands  severe damage to large areas of skin exposes the human organism to dehydration and infections that can result in death traditional ways of dealing with large losses of skin have been to use skin grafts from the patient autografts or from an unrelated donor or a cadaver the former approach has the disadvantage that there may not be enough skin available while the latter suffers from the possibility of rejection or infection until the late twentieth century skin grafts were constructed from the patients own skin this became a problem when skin had been damaged extensively making it impossible to treat severely injured patients entirely with autografts  a process for inducing regeneration in skin was invented by dr ioannis v yannas then assistant professor in the fibers and polymers division department of mechanical engineering massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma and dr john f burke then chief of staff shriners burns institute boston ma their initial objective was to discover a wound cover that would protect severe skin wounds from infection by accelerating wound closure several kinds of grafts made of synthetic and natural polymers were prepared and tested in a guinea pig animal model by late 1970s it was evident that the original objective was not reached instead these experimental grafts typically did not affect the speed of wound closure in one case however a particular type of collagen graft led to significant delay of wound closure  careful study of histology samples revealed that grafts that delayed wound closure induced the synthesis of new dermis de novo at the injury site instead of forming scar which is the normal outcome of the spontaneous wound healing response this was the first demonstration of regeneration of a tissue dermis that does not regenerate by itself in the adult mammal       after the initial discovery further research led to the composition and fabrication of grafts that were evaluated in clinical trials   these grafts were synthesized as a graft copolymer of microfibrillar type i collagen and a glycosaminoglycan chondroitin6sulfate fabricated into porous sheets by freezedrying and then crosslinked by dehydrothermal treatment  control of the structural features of the collagen scaffold average pore size degradation rate and surface chemistry was eventually found to be a critical prerequisite for its unusual biological activity several patents were granted to mit for the discovery of collagenbased grafts that can induce dermis regeneration us pat 4418691 december 6 1983 was cited by the national inventors hall of fame as the key patent describing the invention of a process for regenerated skin inductees natl inventors hall of fame 2015  these patents were translated later into a commercial product integratm by integra lifesciences corp a company founded in 1993 integratm grafts received fda approval in 1996 and since then are being applied worldwide to treat patients who are in need of new skin to treat massive burns those undergoing plastic surgery of the skin and patients with chronic skin wounds as well as others who suffer from certain forms of skin cancer in clinical practice a thin graft sheet manufactured from the active collagen scaffold is placed on the injury site which is then covered with a thin sheet of silicone elastomer that protects the wound site from bacterial infection and dehydration the graft can be seeded with autologous cells keratinocytes in order to accelerate wound closure however the presence of these cells is not required for regenerating the dermis  grafting skin wounds with integratm leads to the synthesis of normal vascularized and innervated dermis de novo followed by reepithelization and formation of epidermis although early versions of the scaffold were not capable of regenerating hair follicles and sweat glands later developments by st boyce and coworkers led to solution of this problem  the mechanism of regeneration using an active collagen scaffold has been largely clarified the scaffold retains regenerative activity provided that it has been prepared with appropriate levels of the specific surface pore size in range 20125µm degradation rate degradation halflife 14  7 days and surface chemical features ligand densities for integrins \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21 must exceed approximately 200 \u03bc\u03bc \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21 ligands  it has been hypothesized that specific binding of a sufficient number of contractile cells myofibroblasts on the scaffold surface occurring within a narrow time window is required for induction of skin regeneration in the presence of this scaffold  studies with skin wounds have been extended to transected peripheral nerves and the combined evidence supports a common regeneration mechanism for skin and peripheral nerves using this scaffold  research is continually being done on artificial skin newer technologies such as an autologous sprayon skin produced by avita medical  are being tested in efforts to accelerate healing and minimize scarring the fraunhofer institute for interfacial engineering and biotechnology is working towards a fully automated process for producing artificial skin their goal is a simple twolayer skin without blood vessels that can be used to study how skin interacts with consumer products such as creams and medicines they hope to eventually produce more complex skin that can be used in transplants  hanna wendt and a team of her colleagues in the department of plastic hand and reconstructive surgery at medical school hannover germany have found a method for creating artificial skin using spider silk before this however artificial skin was grown using materials like collagen these materials did not seem strong enough instead wendt and her team turned to spider silk which is known to be 5 times stronger than kevlar the silk is harvested by milking the silk glands of golden orb web spiders the silk was spooled as it was harvested and then it was woven into a rectangular steel frame the steel frame was 07mm thick and the resulting weave was easytohandle as well as easy to sterilize human skin cells were added to the meshwork silk and were found to flourish under an environment providing nutrients warmth and air however at this time using spider silk to grow artificial skin in mass quantities is not practical because of the tedious process of harvesting spider silk  australian researchers are currently searching for a new innovative way to produce artificial skin this would produce artificial skin quicker and in a more efficient way the skin produced would only be 1 millimeter thick and would only be used to rebuild the epidermis they can also make the skin 15 millimeters thick which would allow the dermis to repair itself if needed this would require bone marrow from a donation or from the patients body the bone marrow would be used as a seed and would be placed in the grafts to mimic the dermis this has been tested on animals and has been proven to work with animal skin professor maitz said in australia someone with a fullthickness burn to up to 80 per cent of their body surface area has every prospect of surviving the injuryhowever their quality of life remains questionable as were unable at present to replace the burned skin with normal skinwere committed to ensuring the pain of survival is worth it by developing a living skin equivalent  another form of artificial skin has been created out of flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs   the artificial skin is anticipated to augment robotics in conducting rudimentary jobs that would be considered delicate and require sensitive touch   scientists found that by applying a layer of rubber with two parallel electrodes that stored electrical charges inside of the artificial skin tiny amounts of pressure could be detected when pressure is exerted the electrical charge in the rubber is changed and the change is detected by the electrodes however the film is so small that when pressure is applied to the skin the molecules have nowhere to move and become entangled the molecules also fail to return to their original shape when the pressure is removed  a recent development in the synthetic skin technique has been made by imparting the color changing properties to the thin layer of silicon with the help of artificial ridges which reflect a very specific wavelength of light by tuning the spaces between these ridges color to be reflected by the skin can be controlled  this technology can be used in colorshifting camouflages and sensors that can detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings bridges and aircraft

V liver cytology is the branch of cytology that studies the liver cells and its functions the liver is a vital organ in charge of almost all the bodys metabolism main liver cells are hepatocytes kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells each one with a specific function   cytology is the name given to the branch of biology that deals with the formation structure and functionality of the cells  liver cytology specializes in the study of liver cells the main liver cells are called hepatocytes however there are other cells that can be observed in a liver sample such as kupffer cells macrophages  the liver is the biggest gland of the body as well as the biggest organ it has a wide variety of functions that range from the destruction of old blood cells to the control of the whole metabolism of macromolecules  in the fetus the liver works as a principal center for hematopoiesis function that is later replaced by the bone marrow this hematopoietic function is not normally seen after birth however in certain pathological conditions this function may still be seen it is important to note that the liver is an essential organ and it is the only one in the body that has the ability to regenerate itself after surgery or damage  since cytology deals with tissues which are composed of cells samples of tissues must be obtained in order to analyze the cells there are several ways of obtaining a sample the first is through dissecting a corpse with a sample of tissue taken during an autopsy the second is performing an aspirate bone marrow cerebrospinal fluid etc to perform an aspirate in liquid tissues a needle is inserted inside the body and a sample is extracted another common method is surgery with a piece being removed during the procedure for later analysis finally another common method is biopsy in a biopsy a needle is inserted into the skin and a solid sample of tissue is obtained  after the sample is obtained it has to be processed by different methods depending on the nature of the sample liquid samples such as blood are extracted and dried out while solid samples must be dehydrated using a different combination of alcoholic compounds  the tissue must also be stained usually with haematoxylin and eosin a pair of colorants that identify the acidicbasic nature of the cells  after this treatment the samples are analyzed under a microscope which can be optical or electronic to determine if the sample is normal or pathological  the hepatocytes are the parenchymal cells of the liver which form the lobules they are intimately associated with the sinusoids which are a network of capillaries since they are metabolically active cells their cytoplasm has many organelles  hepatocytes are the main cells of the liver they are large polyhedral cells with six surfaces three of which have a relevant function the threes relevant type of surfaces are sinusoidal canalicular and intercellular these surfaces are involved in the exchange of substances between the hepatocyte the vessels and the biliar canaliculi the sinusoidal surfaces are separated from the sinusoids because of the perisinusoidal space they represent 70 of the total hepatocyte surface they are coated by microvilli which emerge to the perisinusoidal space these surfaces are the place where the exchange of substances between the hepatocytes and the sinusoids occurs the canalicular surfaces are the ones through which bile drains from the hepatocytes to the canaliculi they represent 15 of the surface of the cell the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte near canaliculi is rich in actin filaments and they are probably capable of modifying the canaliculis diameter thus influencing the flow however this is not yet proven the intercellular surfaces are the ones that are between two adjacent hepatocytes and they are not in contact with sinusoids or canaliculi these are simple surfaces specialized in the cellular adherence and in the communication between hepatocytes through gap junctions  hepatocytes measure between 20 and 30µm in each dimension they are in charge of developing all the functions of the liver such as the metabolism of lipids carbohydrates and proteins as well as the processing of hormones and drugs hepatocytes constitute about 80 of the cell population of the liver with the other 20 being occupied by kupffer cells hepatic stellate cells endothelial cells and mesothelial cells which are not exactly characteristic of the liver but are present in the liver samples  histologically speaking hepatocytes have specific characteristics their nuclei are large and spheroidal occupying the center of the cell there is at least one nucleolus in each nucleus in the adult liver most of the cells are binucleated and most of the hepatocytes are tetraploid which means that they have four times the amount of normal dna their average lifespan is from approximately five months and hepatocytes have a significant regeneration capacity after parenchymal loss by toxic processes diseases or surgeries their cytoplasm is mostly acidophilic basophilic regions correspond to the rer and free ribosomes mitochondria are abundant in hepatocytes from 800 to 1000 per cell they can be detected using janus green b or enzimohistochemistry hepatocytes possess multiple golgi complexes and have large numbers of peroxisomes which can be detected with immunohistochemistry smooth endoplasmic reticulum can be extensive and may contain enzymes involved in degradation and conjugation of toxins and drugs and other enzymes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and lipoproteins  liver sinusoids are different from the rest of the bodys sinusoids since they have macrophage cells intercalated in between their endothelial cells kupffer cells have a different embryological origin coming from the myeloid line in the reticuloendohelial system also called mononuclear phagocyte system and are related to the immune system they first develop in the bone marrow and then migrate to the liver where they differentiate into kupffer cells in fact they are the macrophages of the liver and are located in the sinusoids sinusoids are vascular channels that receive blood from terminal branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein and make it flow to the central veins the space located between the endothelium is known as the disse space histologically speaking kupffer cells are difficult to identify however they are easily seen if there are stained particles that were phagocytosed the main function of the kupffer cells is the destruction of old blood cells that go through the liver  in the perisinusoidal space a different type of cells can be found these cells are characteristic of the liver since they are not found in any other tissue these hepatic stellate cells also named lipocytes have lipid drops in their cytosol it is thought that these drops store a fraction of the bodys a vitamin supply hepatic stellate cells rest over the remak trabecules and they emit extensions to the sinusoids

V the two main methods for replacing bladder function involve either redirecting urine flow or replacing the bladder in situ  replacement can be done with an artificial urinary bladder an artificial organ   on january 30 1999 scientists announced that a labgrown bladder had been successfully transplanted into dogs these artificial bladders worked well for almost a year in the dogs in 2000 a new procedure for creating artificial bladders for humans was developed this procedure is called an orthotopic neobladder procedure this procedure involves shaping a part usually 35 to 40inches of a patients small intestine to form a new bladder however as explained above these bladders made of intestinal tissues produced unpleasant sideeffects in 2006 the first publication of experimental transplantation of bioengineered bladders appeared in the lancet  the trial involved seven people with spina bifida between the ages of four and nineteen who had been followed for up to five years after surgery to determine longterm effects  the bladders were prepared and the trial run by a team of biologists at the wake forest university school of medicine and boston childrens hospital led by professor anthony atala  bioengineered organs which rely on a patients own cells autologous constructs are not subject to transplant rejection unlike transplants from human or animal donors the current standard for repairing a damaged urinary bladder involves partial or complete replacement using tissue from the small intestine

V a bulbourethral gland also called a cowper gland for english anatomist william cowper is one of two small exocrine glands in the reproductive system of many male mammals of all domesticated animals they are only absent in the dog  they are homologous to bartholins glands in females   bulbourethral glands are located posterior and lateral to the membranous portion of the urethra at the base of the penis between the two layers of the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm in the deep perineal pouch they are enclosed by transverse fibers of the sphincter urethrae membranaceae muscle the bulbourethral glands are compound tubuloalveolar glands each approximately the size of a pea in humans in chimpanzees they are not visible during dissection but can be found on microscopic examination  in boars they are up to 18cm long and 5cm in diameter  they are composed of several lobules held together by a fibrous covering each lobule consists of a number of acini lined by columnar epithelial cells opening into a duct that joins with the ducts of other lobules to form a single excretory duct this duct is approximately 25cm long and opens into the bulbar urethra at the base of the penis the glands gradually diminish in size with advancing age   a study published in human fertility in march 2011 suggests that some human males often or always excrete sperm carried out of the body by cowpers gland secretions prior to ejaculation at concentrations similar to those found in their semen  this could result in the possibility of conception from the introduction of preejaculate alone to the vagina though the direct probability of pregnancy has not been assessed the cowpers gland also produces some amount of prostatespecific antigen psa and cowpers tumors may increase psa to a level that makes prostate cancer suspected  the bulbourethral gland contributes about 01 to 02 ml or 5 of the ejaculate the secretion is a clear fluid that is rich in mucoproteins the secretion also helps to lubricate the distal urethra and neutralize acidic urine which remains in urethra structure of the penis male pelvic organs seen from right side vertical section of bladder penis and urethra bulbourethral gland labeled at center left

V a cochlear implant ci is a surgically implanted electronic device that provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing cochlear implants may help provide hearing in patients who are deaf because of damage to sensory hair cells in their cochleas these sensory cells never regenerate unlike most cells in the body cochlear implants replace the input of those lost or damaged hair cells to replicate the different frequencies and amplitudes of sound implants can augment hearing sufficiently to improve understanding of speech and environmental sounds although the quality of sound is different from natural hearing and the input subject to different neural regulation newer devices and processing strategies allow recipients to hear better in noise enjoy music and even use their implant processors while swimming as of december 2012 approximately 324000 people worldwide have surgically implanted cochlear implants in the us roughly 58000 adults and 38000 children are recipients  some recipients have bilateral implants to allow for stereo sound however barriers such as the cost of the device prevent many patients from acquiring the device longterm auditory therapy following implantation is often required for patients to accurately interpret the soundwaves from the device   any history of the cochlear implant must start with an overview  of nonsurgical treatments proposed in the eighteenth century to overcome the social and psychological consequences of total neonatal deafness the story begins in the early eighteenth century although the frenchman abbé de lépée   17121759 did not actually invent sign language he did at least bring together the results of various experiences notably those in spain before standardizing and teaching this method with the aim of facilitating communication among all those who practise it whether deaf or not abbé de lépée was the first to use sign language to promote the mental development and education of deaf children in the middle of the eighteenth century he created a free public school which survived the french revolution and was perpetuated by the nascent republic in the form of the national institute for deafmutes institution nationale des sourdsmuets this institute now called the national institute for young deaf people institution nationale des jeunes sourds has always been located in rue st jacques paris for many years it was recognized internationally as a leader in the education of deaf children but its teachers and physicians disagreed on certain teaching methods the teachers tended to prefer oralisation difficult owing to the lack of sensory feedback while the physicians notably prosper menière and edouard fournié opted for sign language in fact this disagreement concerned not only communication itself but also the very place of deaf people in society sign language favored the teaching and development of deaf people within their own community while oralisation sought to integrate deaf people into the rest of society towards the end of the 19th century the development of international transport and the ent ear nose and throat medical discipline internationalized the debate early cochlear implants in adolescents and adults who had been deaf since birth met with failure often abandoned by their users these failures largely accounted for the widespread opposition of the deaf community to this new therapeutic approach animal experiments  subsequently showed that the auditory system could mature with chronic cochlear implant stimulation  but only if they started to be stimulated within an early period after birth  early cochlear implantation in children and the corresponding maturational processes ignited in their brains support such concept  electrical stimulation of afferent auditory pathways became feasible in the last half of the twentieth century chronologically its development can be divided into three periods in 1961 g von bekesy 18991972 received the nobel prize for demonstrating that sounds trigger vibrations of the basilar membrane which spread from the base to the apex of the cochlea in the form of longitudinal waves peaks occur at various points depending on the frequency resembling the keys of a piano with low frequencies towards the apex and high frequencies towards the oval window the terms cochlear keyboard and cochlear tonotopy are often used to describe these phenomena in 1968 h davis described the physiology of auditory receptors  in 1972 ny kiang unraveled the physiology of electrical stimulation of the inner ear  in 1975 ef evans showed that each sensory afferent fiber of the cochlear nerve handles a specific frequency making it electively sensitive to a very narrow frequency band  in 1957 a djourno a parisian professor of medical physics and c eyries a parisian otologist restored hearing to a deaf patient with total bilateral cholesteatomas by electrically stimulating acoustic nerve fibers still present in the inner ear this result was fortuitous however djourno and eyries had in fact been seeking to remobilize the frozen facial traits of a patient with cholesteatomas in both ears which had been complicated probably many years previously by bilateral facial paralysis they failed in their primary goal but had the wherewithal to record their electroacoustic observations over several weeks and to publish them in the french journal presse médicale  they stopped their experiment when the apparatus broke down after less than a month if these french researchers had not noted their unexpected findings william house might never have dared try to compensate total deafness which is all the more severe when bilateral in 1961 a patient gave william house  a californian otologist a copy of a los angeles times article  describing the work of the paris researchers house had already transformed the functional outcome of cerebellopontine angle surgery by making use of the first surgical microscopes developed in the late 1950s and was familiar with total deafness he resumed his research basing his indications on what was known at the time about the physiology of hearing a rapidly progressing field at least in animals house standardized the surgical procedure and stably positioned the stimulatory electrode by threading it through the round window in the cochlear channel he encountered a number of difficulties especially in sealing the implant solutions emerged with the advent of pacemakers but it took house almost ten years to develop a singlechannel cochlear implant this ultimately robust and simple device stimulated the whole set of the auditory nerve fibers simultaneously meaning that the recipient was able to recognize only the rhythms of the speech house marketed his device jointly with j urban  and continued to implant it until at least 1965 the system was sufficiently reliable for researchers and otologists to overlook its mediocre functional performance in 1966 b simmons palo alto ca  performed the first temporary human implantation of a multichannel system in the trunk of the auditory nerve itself in a deaf volunteer this experimental work showed that stimulation of limited quotas of the auditory nerve fibers generated sensations of different frequencies depending on the origin of the stimulated fibers on the cochlear keyboard shortly afterwards mr merzenich ucsf  san francisco  confirmed these findings in macaques using a different approach in 1967 g clark in melbourne  created a team to conduct basic research on the pathophysiology of profound deafness in animals and on the tolerability of implanted materials in 1973 r michelson ucsf  san francisco  chronically implanted a deaf man with an experimental multichannel implant this device used pairs of antennas for each channel one transmitting and one receiving it was possible to measure several parameters and to test various types of stimulation including both bipolar and unipolar in 1973 ch chouard had extensive personal experience of petrous bone surgery involving the vestibular and facial nerves   together with p macleod a close friend specializing in sensory physiology chouard decided to create a multidisciplinary team at the ent research laboratory of stantoine teaching hospital in paris  in 1975 the two men showed in several patients with total unilateral traumatic deafness and facial paralysis  that electrical stimulation of 8 to 12 electrodes isolated from one another and placed in different parts of the scala tympani allowed the recipients to perceive different frequencies then having developed a test to ensure that auditory fibers were still present and functional based on electrical stimulation of the round window the paris team implanted their electrodes in patients with longstanding total bilateral deafness after a relatively brief period of postoperative speech therapy all the patients were able to recognize a variable percentage of words without lipreading  under the scientific direction of p mac leod industrial production of an implantable functional device was entrusted to the bertin a french company a tabletop prototype was quickly built but the untimely death of jean bertin in late 1975 led to restructuring of the company and it was only in the summer of 1976 that the french researchers finally received the first 6 devices in the meantime other french teams launched their own research programs particularly in the area of the electrodes bearer but they were forced to abandon their efforts    in 1975 k burian  in vienna building on the long tradition of the viennese ent school launched the development of the first austrian implant his work on singlechannel intra and extracochlear stimulation and then on multichannel stimulation was pursued by his pupil i hochmairdesoyer and her husband professor hochmair of innsbruck their work culminated in 1982 with the austrian medel implant the first implant took place at saintantoine hospital paris on wednesday 22 september 1976 it was performed by ch chouard assisted by bernard meyer the patient recovered his hearing the following day and another 5 patients were quickly implanted despite the bulky nature of the transmitter on 16 march 1977 bertin filed patent no 7707824 based on the physiological criteria of macleod and making two simultaneous claims 1 sequential transmission to the cochlea of an indeterminate number of frequency bands and 2 transmission of all the sound information the first results were presented at the xith world ent conference in buenos aires and were quickly published   for nearly twenty years this document influenced all the procedures and approaches used by other international teams who were obliged to find ways around the patent claims usually by opting to transmit only a portion of the speech information until the patent fell into the public domain in 1997 on 3 november 1977 the team of g clark australia filed a patent for a system with three functional electrodes but using only a limited part of the speech information voicing and one of the two formants of the vowels in 1975 ingeborg and erwin hochmair started cochlear implant development at the technical university of vienna 1977 the worlds first microelectronic multichannel cochlear implant developed by ingeborg and erwin hochmair was implanted in vienna by prof kurt burian 1924  1996 the implant had 8 channels a stimulation rate of 10000 pulses per second per channel and 8 independent current sources and flexible electrode for 2225mm insertion into the cochlea prof kurt burian inserted the flexible electrode through the round window into the scala tympani  in december 1977 the austrian team implanted a multichannel system with sufficient flexibility to study responses to various manipulations of the sound signal  september 1978 saw the first international teaching seminar on cochlear implants held in paris and attended by representatives of the other three involved countries namely i hochmairdesoyer and e hochmair austria j patrick australia r michelson and r schindler usa in 1978 graeme clark australia implanted his first patient  in fall of 1979 a patient implanted in august 1979 with a device by ingeborg and erwin hochmair received a small body worn speech processor it was modified in march 1980 at which time the patient became the first person to show open set speech understanding without lipreading using a portable processor  in 1982 ch chouard employing the born reconstruction technique which he had previously used in his neuroanatomical research together with c eyries  was the first to demonstrate in animals  the need for early implantation to avoid the atrophy of the central auditory structures that occurs very rapidly in case of persistent neonatal deafness in 1982 the new bertin device chorimac 12 was presented it had 12 electrodes and a smaller transmitter but was still much larger than the australian and austrian devices a few years later after announcing the arrival of the alldigital device  that chouard and macleod had been demanding since 1980 bertin abandoned the field and sold its license to another french company mxmneurelec in 1987 bertin filed for bankruptcy in 1998 in 1983 the 2nd international conference on cochlear implants was held in the former paris faculty of medicine just before the annual meeting of the international ent collegium orlas in 1984 the us food and drug administration approved the australian implant for use in adults in 1985 the australians improved on their original device35 which now transmitted all the vowel information  in 1990 the us food and drug administration approved the australian implant for young children in 1990 ingeborg and erwin hochmair started their company medel based in innsbruck austria and hired their first employees one year later the company presented the worlds first behindtheear audio processor  in 1991 mxmneurelec presented their first multichannel implant based on the bertin license it was fully digitized and could be adapted to an ossified cochlea  from 1992 onwards the multichannel cochlear implant gradually gained acceptance in france other teams first in montpellier   and toulouse begin to implant it at the same time the sound processing strategy used by the different cochlear implants gradually adopted technology resembling that described in the bertin patent delivering all the sound information in a sequential manner the american implant too provided the entire information in this way while avoiding falling foul of the french patent by employing a few clever tricks and restrictions the australian device was also improved providing all the sound information but retaining only the channels containing the maximum energy this restriction also avoided the bertin patent claims  in 1994 medel presented the worlds first electrode array capable of stimulating the entire length of the cochlea to allow a more natural hearing  in 1995 paris organized the 3rd international conference on cochlear implants  1996 medel presented the worlds first miniaturised multichannel implant 4mm thin and also had the first bilateral implantation for the purpose of binaural hearing  in 1997 the french license was blatantly copied leading to bertin to bring a lawsuit with seizure of the apparatus in question this was just before the patent fell into the public domain however the charges were quickly dropped following protests in some surgical centers in addition the cost of the legal proceedings far exceeded any financial retribution the company could expect to obtain  all manufacturers have since applied the principles of the bertin patent defined by p mac leod and ch chouard  following the french national ethics committees  approval of screening in the early neonatal period and the tercentenary of the work of abbe de lépée  celebrated in 2012 at the initiative of legent the positions of the deaf and hearing communities in france have started to be reconciled in a cordial and respectful dialogue avoiding proselytism the two communities are striving to refine the criteria of choice between the cochlear implant and the use of sign language  both options are sometimes valid the implant is surgically placed under the skin behind the ear the basic parts of the device include a number of factors determine the degree of success to expect from the operation and the device itself cochlear implant centers determine implant candidacy on an individual basis and take into account a persons hearing history cause of hearing loss amount of residual hearing speech recognition ability health status and family commitment to aural habilitationrehabilitation a prime candidate is described as people with mild or moderate sensorineural hearing loss are generally not candidates for cochlear implantation their needs can often be met with hearing aids alone or hearing aids with an fm system after the implant is put into place sound no longer travels via the ear canal and middle ear but is picked up by a microphone and sent through the devices speech processor to the implants electrodes inside the cochlea thus most candidates have been diagnosed with a severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss the presence of auditory nerve fibers is essential to the functioning of the device if these are damaged to such an extent that they cannot receive electrical stimuli the implant will not work some individuals with severe auditory neuropathy may also benefit from cochlear implants postlingually deaf adults prelingually deaf children and postlingually hard of hearing people usually children who have lost hearing due to diseases such as cmv and meningitis form three distinct groups of potential users of cochlear implants with different needs and outcomes those who have lost their hearing as adults were the first group to find cochlear implants useful in regaining some comprehension of speech and other sounds the outcomes of individuals that have been deaf for a long period of time before implantation are sometimes astonishing although more variable the risk of surgery in the older patient must be weighed against the improvement in quality of life as the devices improve particularly the sound processor hardware and software the benefit is often judged to be worth the surgical risk particularly for the newly deaf elderly patient  another group of customers is parents of children born deaf who want to ensure that their children grow up with good spoken language skills the brain develops after birth and adapts its function to the sensory input absence of this has functional consequences for the brain and consequently congenitally deaf children who receive cochlear implants at a young age less than 2 years have better success with them than congenitally deaf children who first receive the implants at a later age  though the critical period for utilizing auditory information does not close completely until adolescence one doctor has said there is a time window during which they can get an implant and learn to speak from the ages of two to four that ability diminishes a little bit and by age nine there is zero chance that they will learn to speak properly so its really important that they get recognized and evaluated early  additionally there is another sensitive period for strong asymmetry in hearing that closes earlier in life in cases of early singlesided deafness or unilateral cochlear implantation the brain reorganizes towards the hearing ear and that puts the deaf ear into a disadvantage  consequently the benefit of a sequential second implantation on the deaf ear is critically dependent on the delay between implantations  periods of asymmetric hearing during early childhood should be avoided and therapy of deafness should be binaural the third group who will benefit substantially from cochlear implantation are postlingual subjects who have lost hearing a common cause is childhood meningitis young children under five years in these cases often make excellent progress after implantation because they have learned how to form sounds and only need to learn how to interpret the new information in their brains  by the end of 2008 the total number of cochlear implant recipients had grown to an estimated 150000 worldwide  a story in 2000 stated that one in ten deaf children in the united states had a cochlear implant and the projection was that the ratio would rise to one in three in ten years  mexico had performed 55 cochlear implant operations by the year 2000 berruecos 2000 taiwan and china announced an approximately 270 million order for cochlear implant devices for children in 2006 which are being paid for by major healthcare organization based in taipei these cochlear implants are a donation by the taiwanese organization   in india there are an estimated 1 million profoundly deaf children and about 5000 have cochlear implants this minuscule number is due to the high costs for the implant as well as subsequent therapy  the device is surgically implanted under a general anesthetic or local anesthetic without or with sedation  and the operation usually takes from 1½ to 5 hours first a small area of the scalp directly behind the ear may be shaved and cleaned then an incision is made in the skin behind the ear and the surgeon drills into the mastoid bone creating a pocket for the receiverstimulator and then into the inner ear where the electrode array is inserted into the cochlea the patient normally goes home the same day or the day after the surgery although some cochlear implant recipients stay in the hospital for 1 to 2 days as with every medical procedure the surgery involves a certain amount of risk in this case the risks include skin infection onset of or change in tinnitus damage to the vestibular system and damage to facial nerves that can cause muscle weakness impaired facial sensation or in the worst cases facial paralysis there is also the risk of device failure usually where the incision does not heal properly this occurs in 2 of cases and the device must be removed  there is also a potential risk to lose the residual hearing the patient may have in the implanted ear because of the shaving of hair cells in the cochlea but the chances have decreased over time as a result some doctors advise singleear implantation saving the other ear in case a biological treatment becomes available in the future however with a careful surgical technique and a flexible electrode the residual hearing of the patient can be preserved ever since ingeborg hochmair and her husband erwin hochmair started their work this aspect has been one of the priorities  after 14 weeks of healing the wait is usually longer for children than adults the implant is activated by connecting an external sound processor to the internal device via a magnet initial results vary widely and postimplantation therapy is required as well as time for the brain to adapt to hearing new sounds in the case of congenitally deaf children audiological training and speech therapy typically continue for years though infants can become age appropriateable to speak and understand at the same level as a hearing child of the same age the participation of the childs family in working on spoken language development is considered to be even more important than therapy because the family can aid development by participating activelyand continuallyin the childs therapy making hearing and listening interesting talking about objects and actions and encouraging the child to make sounds and form words professionals trained to work with children who have received cochlear implants are a major part of the parentprofessional team when addressing the task of teaching children to use their hearing to develop speech and spoken language these professionals include but are not limited to some users audiologists and surgeons also report that when there is an ear infection causing fluid in the middle ear it can affect the cochlear implant leading to temporarily reduced hearing  the implant has a few effects unrelated to hearing manufacturers have cautioned against scuba diving due to the pressures involved but the depths found in normal recreational diving appear to be safe the external components generally need to be turned off and removed prior to swimming or showering unless manufacturers specified that the external components are water proof in most cases certain diagnostic tests such as magnetic resonance imaging mri cannot be used on patients with cochlear implants without first removing the small internal magnet an outpatient procedure usually performed with a local anesthetic but some implants are now fda approved for use with certain strengths of mri machine the company medel has tackled this issue and has launched in 2014 the implant synchrony pin users with this implant do not have to undergo multiple surgeries to remove and reinsert the magnet and consequently lose their hearing while the magnet is out to undergo a mri of up to 30 tesla common strength of mri nowadays  large amounts of static electricity can cause the devices memory to reset for this reason children with cochlear implants are also advised to avoid plastic playground slides  the electronic stimulation the implant creates appears to have a positive effect on the nerve tissue that surrounds it  in the united states medical costs run from us45000 to us125000  this includes evaluation the surgery itself hardware device hospitalization and rehabilitation some or all of this may be covered by health insurance in the united kingdom the nhs covers cochlear implants in full as does medicare in australia and the department of health  in ireland seguridad social in spain and israel and the ministry of health or acc depending on the cause of deafness in new zealand according to the us national institute on deafness and other communication disorders the estimated total cost is 60000 per person implanted  a study by johns hopkins university determined that for a threeyearold child who receives cochlear implants can save 30000 to 50000 in specialeducation costs for elementary and secondary schools as they are more likely to be mainstreamed in school and thus use fewer support services than similarly deaf children  a cochlear implant will not cure deafness but is a prosthetic substitute for hearing some recipients find them very effective others somewhat effective and some feel worse overall with the implant than without  on the other hand there are efficiency studies that show that unilateral implantation is highly cost efficient and that there is a decrease in the societal cost in comparison to nonimplanted children   for people already functional in spoken language who lose their hearing cochlear implants can be a great help in restoring functional comprehension of speech especially if they have only lost their hearing for a short time individuals who have acquired deafblindness loss of hearing and vision combined may find cochlear implants a radical improvement in their daily lives it may provide them with more information for safety communication balance orientation and mobility and promote interaction within their environment and with other people reducing isolation having more auditory information than they may be familiar with may provide them with sensory information that will help them become more independent british member of parliament jack ashley received a cochlear implant in 1994 at age 70 after 25 years of deafness and reported that he has no trouble speaking to people he knows whether one on one or even on the telephone although he might have difficulty with a new voice or with a busy conversation and still had to rely to some extent on lip reading he described the robotic sound of human voices perceived through the cochlear implant as a croaking dalek with laryngitis another recipient described the initial sounds as similar to radio static and voices as being cartoonish though after a year with the implant she said everything sounded right  even modern cochlear implants have at most 22 electrodes to replace the 16000 delicate hair cells that are used for normal hearing however the sound quality delivered by a cochlear implant is often good enough that many users do not have to rely on lip reading in quiet conditions in noisy conditions however speech understanding often remains poor  adults who have grown up deaf can find the implants ineffective or irritating this relates to the specific pathology of deafness and the time frame adults who are born with normal hearing and who have had normal hearing for their early years and who have then progressively lost their hearing tend to have better outcomes than adults who were born deaf this is due to the neural patterns laid down in the early years of life which are crucially important to speech perception cochlear implants cannot overcome such a problem some who were orally educated and used amplifying hearing aids have been more successful with cochlear implants as the perception of sound was maintained through use of the hearing aid daily exercises such as side by side tracking listening to audio books while reading a print book synthetic training and analytic training can improve the efficacy of an implant through practice  children without a working auditory nerve may be helped with a cochlear implant although the results may not be optimal patients without a viable auditory nerve are usually identified during the candidacy process fewer than 1 of deaf individuals have a missing or damaged auditory nerve which today can be treated with an auditory brainstem implant research published in 2005 has suggested that children and adults can benefit from bilateral cochlear implants in order to aid in sound localization and speech understanding  and a 2011 study indicated that the language skills of children with two implants were within the normal range for the age  efficacy of cochlear implantation in the setting of otosclerosis has been demonstrated  some effects of implantation are irreversible while the device promises to provide new sound information for a recipient the implantation process inevitably results in shaving of the hair cells within the cochlea  which can result in a permanent loss of some or all residual natural hearing however with flexible electrodes and the right surgical methods the hair cells can be preserved while recent improvements in implant technology and implantation techniques promise to minimize such damage the risk and extent of damage still varies the goal of new implantation techniques is to reduce the risk of infection operating time and complications while improving the patients ability to hear such improvements of implantation techniques include preserving low frequency hearing and using minimal invasive surgery to better secure the device   still the cause of deafness is not always identified before the surgery it is possible but rare that the surgery does not restore hearing at all the united states food and drug administration reports that cochlear implant recipients may be at higher risk for meningitis  a study of 4265 american children who received implants between 1997 and 2002 concluded that recipient children had a risk of pneumococcal meningitis more than 30 times greater than that for children in the general population  a later ukbased study found that while the incidence of meningitis in implanted adults was significantly higher than the general population the incidence in children was no different from the general population  as a result the centers for disease control and prevention and the food and drug administration both recommend that wouldbe implant recipients be vaccinated against meningitis prior to surgery  rarely necrosis has been observed in the skin flaps surrounding cochlear implants   hyperbaric oxygen has been shown to be a useful adjunctive therapy in the management of cochlear implant flap necrosis  as the location of the cochlea is close to the facial nerve there is a risk that the nerve may be damaged during the operation the incidence of the damage is infrequent  there are strict protocols in choosing candidates to avoid risks and disadvantages a battery of tests is performed to make the decision of candidacy easier for example some patients suffer from deafness medial to the cochlea  typically vestibular schwannomas implantation into the cochlea has a low success rate with these people as the artificial signal does not have a healthy nerve to travel along historically patients with severe congenital anatomic anomalies of the cochlea were considered poor candidates for cochlear implantation many studies since the 1980s have demonstrated successful hearing outcomes after ci in this group blake papsin et al in 2005 published the largest series of patients with cochleovestibular anomalies undergoing implantation and found no significant difference in outcomes versus patients with normal anatomy  michael pakdaman et al in 2012 presented a systematic review of studies reviewing cochlear implantation in anomalous inner ears and found increased surgical difficulty and lower speech perception among patients with more severe inner ear dysplasia  with careful selection of candidates the risks of implantation are minimized the implant works by using the tonotopic organization of the basilar membrane of the inner ear tonotopic organization also referred to as a frequencytoplace mapping is the way the ear sorts out different frequencies so that our brain can process that information in a normal ear sound vibrations in the air lead to resonant vibrations of the basilar membrane inside the cochlea highfrequency sounds ie high pitched sounds do not pass very far along the membrane but low frequency sounds pass farther in the movement of hair cells located all along the basilar membrane creates an electrical disturbance that can be picked up by the surrounding nerve cells the brain is able to interpret the nerve activity to determine which area of the basilar membrane is resonating and therefore what sound frequency is being heard in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss hair cells are often fewer in number andor damaged hair cell loss or absence may be caused by a genetic mutation or an illness such as meningitis hair cells may also be destroyed chemically by an ototoxic medication or simply damaged over time by excessively loud noises the cochlear implant bypasses the hair cells and stimulates the cochlear nerves directly using electrical impulses this allows the brain to interpret the frequency of sound as it would if the hair cells of the basilar membrane were functioning properly see above sound received by the microphone must next be processed to determine how the electrodes should be activated filterbank strategies use fast fourier transforms ffts to divide the signal into different frequency bands the algorithm chooses a number of the strongest outputs from the filters the exact number depending on the number of implanted electrodes and other factors these strategies emphasize transmission of the spectral aspects of speech although coarse temporal information is presented the fine timing aspects are as yet poorly perceived and this is the focus of much current research feature extraction strategies use features which are common to all vowels each vowel has a fundamental frequency the lowest frequency peak and formants peaks with higher frequencies the pattern of the fundamental and formant frequencies is specific for different vowel sounds these algorithms try to recognize the vowel and then emphasize its features these strategies emphasize the transmission of spectral aspects of speech feature extraction strategies are no longer widely used cochlear implant manufacturer use various coding strategies cochlear americas for example uses the speakace strategy ace is mainly used in which number of maxima n from the available maxima in sound are selected advanced bionics uses other techniques like cis sas hires and fidelity 120 which stimulate the full spectrum the processing strategy is a main block upon which one has to choose the implant manufacturer research shows that patients can understand speech with at least 4 electrodes but a greater obstacle is in music perception where it returns that fine structure stimulation is an important issue some strategies used in advanced bionics and medel devices make use of fine structure presentation by implementing the hilbert transform in the signal processing path while ace strategies depends mainly on the short time fourier transform this is used to transmit the processed sound information over a radio frequency link to the internal portion of the device radio frequency is used so that no physical connection is needed which reduces the chance of infection and pain the transmitter attaches to the receiver using a magnet that holds through the skin this component receives directions from the speech processor by way of magnetic induction sent from the transmitter the receiver also receives its power through the transmission the receiver is also a sophisticated computer that translates the processed sound information and controls the electric current sent to the electrodes in the cochlea it is embedded in the skull behind the ear the electrode array is made from a type of silicone rubber while the electrodes are platinum or a similar highly conductive material it is connected to the internal receiver on one end and inserted into the cochlea deeper in the skull the cochlea winds its way around the auditory nerve which is tonotopically organized as is the basilar membrane when an electric current is routed to an intracochlear electrode an electrical field is generated and auditory nerve fibers are stimulated in the devices manufactured by cochlear ltd two electrodes sit outside the cochlea and act as groundsone is a ball electrode that sits beneath the skin while the other is a plate on the device this equates to 24 electrodes in the cochlearbrand nucleus device 22 array electrodes within the cochlea and 2 extracochlear electrodes insertion depth is another important consideration the mean length of the human cochlea is 3336 millimetres 1314in due to some physical limitation the implants do not reach to the apical tip when inserted but it may reach up to 25 millimetres 098in which corresponds to a tonotopical frequency of 4006000hz medel produces long electrode arrays that can be inserted up to a tonotopical frequency of 100hz according to greenwood frequency to position formula in normal hearing but the distance between the electrodes is about 25 millimetres 0098in while in the nucleus freedom from cochlear ltd it is about 07 millimetres 0028in there is strong research in this direction and the best sounding implant can be subjective from patient to patient speech processors are the components of the cochlear implant that transforms the sounds picked up by the microphone into electronic signals capable of being transmitted to the internal receiver the coding strategies programmed by the users audiologist are stored in the processor where it codes the sound accordingly the signal produced by the speech processor is sent through the coil to the internal receiver where it is picked up by radio signal and sent along the electrode array in the cochlea there are primarily two forms of speech processors available the most common kind is called the behindtheear processor or bte it is a small processor that is worn on the ear typically together with the microphone this is the kind of processor used by most adults and older children babies and small children wear either a baby bte pinned or clipped to the collar or the bodyworn processor which was more common in previous years todays tiny processors can often take the place of bulky bodyworn processors medel and cochlear brands both carry a baby bte configurations medel launched in 2013 the worlds first single unit processor which is attached through magnet to the implant and leaves the ear completely free the audiologist sets the minimum and maximum current level outputs for each electrode in the array based on the users reports of loudness the audiologist also selects the appropriate speech processing strategy and program parameters for the user professor graeme clark ac of la trobe university melbourne australia in 2008 announced the beginning of the development of a prototype hi fi cochlear implant featuring 50 electrodes it is hoped that the increased number of electrodes will enable users to perceive music and discern specific voices in noisy rooms  researchers at northwestern university have used infrared lasers to directly stimulate the neurons in the inner ear of deaf guinea pigs while recording electrical activity in the inferior colliculus an area of the midbrain that acts as a bridge between the inner ear and the auditory cortex the laser stimulation produced more precise signals in that brain region than the electrical stimulation commonly used in cochlear implants  laser stimulation is a promising technology for improving the auditory resolution of implants but further research using fiber optics to stimulate the neurons of the inner ear is required before products using the technology can be developed cochlear implants are rarely used in ears that have a functional level of residual hearing however electric acoustic stimulation eas devices including the hybrid shortelectrode cochlear implant have been developed that combine a cochlear implant with a sound amplifying hearing aid   eas devices have the potential to make cochlear implants suitable for many people with partial hearing loss the sound amplifying component helps users to perceive lower frequency sounds through their residual natural hearing while the cochlear implant allows them to hear middle and higher frequency sounds the combination enhances speech perception in noisy environments  additionally work is being done to develop a fully internal cochlear implant as of april 2011 four people have undergone a trial of an internal microphone system with two more yet to come  currently as of 2013  the three cochlear implant devices approved for use in the us are manufactured by cochlear limited australia advanced bionics usa a division of sonova and medel austria in europe africa asia south america and canada an additional device manufactured by neurelec france a division of william demant is available a device made by nurotron china is also available in some parts of the world each manufacturer has adapted some of the successful innovations of the other companies to its own devices there is no consensus that any one of these implants is superior to the others users of all devices report a wide range of performance after implantation since the devices have a similar range of outcomes other criteria are often considered when choosing a cochlear implant fm system compatibility usability of external components cosmetic factors battery life reliability of the internal and external components mri compatibility mapping strategies customer service from the manufacturer the familiarity of the users surgeon and audiologist with the particular device and anatomical concerns there have been reports of other organizations working to develop cochlear implants in india by a branch of the defence research and development organisation  which is expected to reach the clinical trial stage around september 2012  and in south korea by the seoul national university hospital  much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the deaf community which consists largely of prelingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language for some in the deaf community cochlear implants are an affront to their culture which as they view it is a minority threatened by the hearing majority  this is an old problem for the deaf community going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs oralism this is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the normal body in the 19th century when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated  despite the cochlear implant being justified from a medical perspective it is also important to consider the sociocultural context particularly in regards to the deaf community which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture  this accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture as many do not believe that deafness is something that needs to be cured however it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case the cochlear implant can act as a tool deaf people can use to access the hearing world without losing their deaf identity  cochlear implants for congenitally deaf children are considered to be most effective when implanted at a young age during the critical period in which the brain is still learning to interpret sound  hence they are implanted before the recipients can decide for themselves on the assumption that deafness is a disability deaf culture critics argue that the cochlear implant and the subsequent therapy often become the focus of the childs identity at the expense of a possible future deaf identity and ease of communication in sign language and claim that measuring the childs success only by their mastery of hearing and speech will lead to a poor selfimage as disabled because the implants do not produce normal hearing rather than having the healthy selfconcept of a proudly deaf person  children with cochlear implants are more likely to be educated orally in the standard fashion and without access to sign language spencer et al 2003 they are often isolated from other deaf children and from sign language spencer 2003 children do not always receive support in the educational system to fulfill their needs as they may require special education environments and educational assistants according to johnston 2004 cochlear implants have been one of the technological and social factors implicated in the decline of sign languages in the developed world some of the more extreme responses from deaf activists have labeled the widespread implantation of children as cultural genocide  andrew solomon of the new york times states that much national association of the deaf propaganda about the danger of implants is alarmist some of it is positively inaccurate  as the trend for cochlear implants in children grows deafcommunity advocates have tried to counter the either or formulation of oralism vs manualism with a both and approach some schools now are successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs

V the dehaenechangeux model dcm also known as the global neuronal workspace or the global cognitive workspace model is a part of bernard baarss global workspace model for consciousness it is a computer model of the neural correlates of consciousness programmed as a neural network it attempts to reproduce the swarm behaviour   of the brains higher cognitive functions such as consciousness decisionmaking  and the central executive functions it was developed by cognitive neuroscientists stanislas dehaene and jeanpierre changeux beginning in 1986  it has been used to provide a predictive framework to the study of inattentional blindness and the solving of the tower of london test     the dehaenechangeux model was initially established as a spin glass neural network attempting to represent learning and to then provide a stepping stone towards artificial learning among other objectives it would later be used to predict observable reaction times within the priming paradigm  and in inattentional blindness the dehaenechangeux model is a meta neural network ie a network of neural networks composed of a very large number of integrateandfire neurons programmed in either a stochastic or deterministic way the neurons are organised in complex thalamocortical columns with longrange connexions and a critical role   played by the interaction between von economos areas each thalamocortical column is composed of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons receiving a longdistance excitatory neuromodulation which could represent noradrenergic input among others cohen  hudson 2002 had already used meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis   similarly to cohen  hudson dehaene  changeux have established their model as an interaction of metaneural networks thalamocortical columns themselves programmed in the manner of a hierarchy of neural networks that together act as an intelligent agent in order to use them as a system composed of a large scale of interconnected intelligent agents for predicting the selforganized behaviour of the neural correlates of consciousness it may also be noted that jain et al 2002 had already clearly identified spiking neurons as intelligent agents  since the lower bound for computational power of networks of spiking neurons is the capacity to simulate in realtime for booleanvalued inputs any turing machine  the dcm being composed of a very large number of interacting subnetworks which are themselves intelligent agents it is formally a multiagent system programmed as a swarm or neural networks and a fortiori of spiking neurons the dcm exhibits several surcritical   emergent behaviors such as multistability and a hopf bifurcation between two very different regimes which may represent either sleep or arousal with a various allornone behaviors which dehaene et al use to determine a testable taxonomy between different states of consciousness    the dehaenechangeux model contributed to the study of nonlinearity and selforganized criticality in particular as an explanatory model of the brains emergent behaviors including consciousness studying the brains phaselocking and largescale synchronization kitzbichler et al 2011a confirmed that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brains physiological bandwidth  furthermore exploring the neural dynamics of cognitive efforts after inter alia the dehaenechangeux model kitzbichler et al 2011b demonstrated how cognitive effort breaks the modularity of mind to make human brain functional networks transiently adopt a more efficient but less economical configuration  werner 2007a used the dehaenechangeux global neuronal workspace to defend the use of statistical physics approaches for exploring phase transitions scaling and universality properties of the docalled dynamic core of the brain with relevance to the macroscopic electrical activity in eeg and emg  furthermore building from the dehaenechangeux model werner 2007b proposed that the application of the twin concepts of scaling and universality of the theory of nonequilibrium phase transitions can serve as an informative approach for elucidating the nature of underlying neuralmechanisms with emphasis on the dynamics of recursively reentrant activity flow in intracortical and corticosubcortical neuronal loops friston 2000 also claimed that the nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich contextsensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions  it contributed to the study of phase transition in the brain under sedation and notably gabaergic sedation such as that induced by propofol murphy et al 2011 stamatakis et al 2010   the dehaenechangeux model was contrasted and cited in the study of collective consciousness and its pathologies wallace et al 2007  boly et al 2007 used the model for a reverse somatotopic study demonstrating a correlation between baseline brain activity and somatosensory perception in humans  boly et al 2008 also used the dcm in a study of the baseline state of consciousness of the human brains default network

V reports of organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners and other political prisoners in china have raised increasing concern in the international community in recent years according to the reports political prisoners mainly falun gong practitioners are being executed on demand in order to provide organs to recipients the organ harvesting is said to be taking place both as a result of the chinese communist partys persecution of falun gong and because of the financial incentives available to the institutions and individuals involved in the trade reports on systematic organ harvesting from falun gong prisoners first emerged in 2006 though the practice is thought to have started six years earlier several researchersmost notably canadian human rights lawyer david matas former parliamentarian david kilgour and investigative journalist ethan gutmannestimate that tens of thousands of falun gong prisoners of conscience have been killed to supply a lucrative trade in human organs and cadavers and that these abuses may be ongoing  these conclusions are based on a combination of statistical analysis interviews with former prisoners medical authorities and public security agents and circumstantial evidence such as the large number of falun gong practitioners detained extrajudicially in china and the profits to be made from selling organs the chinese government has consistently denied the allegations however the failure of chinese authorities to effectively address or refute the charges has drawn attention and public condemnation from governments international organizations and medical societies the parliaments of canada and the european union as well as the foreign affairs subcommittee of the us house of representatives have adopted resolutions condemning organ harvesting from falun gong prisoners of conscience united nations special rapporteurs have called on the chinese government to account for the sources of organs used in transplant practices and the world medical association the american society of transplantation and the transplantation society have called for sanctions on chinese medical authorities several countries have also taken or considered measures to deter their citizens from traveling to china for the purpose of obtaining organs a documentary on organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners human harvest received a 2014 peabody award recognizing excellence in broadcast journalism    china has one of the largest organ transplant programs in the world with over 13000 transplants a year reported in 2004  and as many as 20000 in 2006  as a matter of culture and custom however the country has extremely low rates of voluntary organ donation between 2003 and 2009 for instance only 130 people volunteered to be organ donors  in 2010 the chinese red cross launched a nationwide initiative to attract voluntary organ donors but only 37 people signed up  due to low levels of voluntary organ donation most organs used in transplants are sourced from prisoners the chinese government approved a regulation in 1984 to allow the removal of organs from executed criminals provided they give prior consent or if no one claims the body  despite the absence of an organized system of organ donation or allocation wait times for obtaining vital organs in china are among the shortest in the worldoften just weeks for organs such as kidneys livers and hearts this has made it a destination for international transplant tourism  and a major venue for tests of pharmaceutical antirejection drugs    the commercial trade in human organs has also been a lucrative source of revenue for the chinese medical military and public security establishments   because there is no effective nationwide organ donation or allocation system hospitals source organs from local brokers including through their connections to courts detention centers and prisons  organ transplant recipients in china are generally not told the identity of the organ donor nor are they provided with evidence of written consent in some cases even the identity of the medical staff and surgeons may be withheld from patients the problem of transparency is compounded by the lack of any ethical guidelines for the transplant profession or system of discipline for surgeons who violate ethical standards  by the 1990s growing concerns about possible abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning chinas use of prisoner organs these concerns resurfaced in 2001 when a chinese military doctor testified before us congress that he had taken part in organ extraction operations from executed prisoners some of whom were not yet dead  in december 2005 chinas deputy health minister huang jiefu acknowledged that up to 95 of transplant organs came from executed prisoners and promised steps to prevent abuse   huang reiterated these claims in 2008 and 2010 stating that over 90 of organ transplants from deceased donors are sourced from prisoners  in 2006 the world medical association demanded that china cease harvesting organs from prisoners who are not deemed able to properly consent  in 2014 huang jiefu said that reliance on organ harvesting from death row inmates was declining while simultaneously defending the practice of using prisoners organs in the transplantation system   in addition to sourcing organs from deathrow inmates international observers and researchers have also expressed concern that prisoners of consciencenotably falun gong practitioners but also potentially tibetans uyghurs and members of underground christian sectsare killed to supply the organ transplant industry   these individuals were not convicted of capital crimes and in many cases were imprisoned extrajudicially on the basis of their political or religious beliefs falun gong is a chinese qigong discipline involving meditation and a moral philosophy rooted in buddhist tradition the practice rose to popularity in the 1990s in china and by 1998 chinese government sources estimated that as many as 70 million people had taken up the practice   perceiving that falun gong was a potential threat to the partys authority and ideology communist party leader jiang zemin initiated a nationwide campaign to eradicate the group in july 1999  an extraconstitutional body called the 610 office was created to lead the persecution of falun gong   and authorities mobilized the state media apparatus judiciary police force army education system families and workplaces to struggle against the group   since 1999 falun gong practitioners have been the targets of systematic torture mass imprisonment forced labour and psychiatric abuse all with the aim of forcing them to recant their beliefs   as of 2009 the new york times reported that at least 2000 falun gong practitioners had been killed amidst the persecution campaign  falun gong sources documented over 3700 named death cases by 2013 due to the difficulty in accessing and relaying information from china however this may represent only a portion of actual deaths  the first allegations of largescale organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners were made in march 2006 by three individuals claiming knowledge of involuntary organ extractions at the sujiatun thrombosis hospital in shenyang liaoning province one of the whistleblowers the wife of a surgeon at the hospital claimed her husband had performed numerous operations to remove the corneas of falun gong practitioners for transplant   representatives of the us state department were dispatched to the sujiatun hospital to investigate the claims they determined that there was insufficient evidence to prove the allegations but said they remained concerned over chinas treatment of falun gong and the reports of organ harvesting  soon thereafter in may 2006 the coalition to investigate the persecution of falun gong asked former canadian parliamentarian david kilgour and human rights lawyer david matas to investigate the broader allegations of organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners in china kilgour and matas agreed to conduct an investigation as volunteers  david kilgour and david matas released the results of their preliminary investigation on july 20 2006 in a report titled report into allegations of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in china  although the pair were denied visas to travel to china they nonetheless compiled over 30 distinct strands of evidence which were consistent with allegations of organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners these included an analysis of statistics on organ transplantation in china interviews with former falun gong prisoners and recorded admissions from chinese hospitals and law enforcement offices about the availability of falun gong practitioners organs  in the absence of evidence that would invalidate the organ harvesting allegationssuch as a chinese government registry showing the source of transplant organskilgour and matas concluded that the chinese government and its agencies have put to death a large but unknown number of falun gong prisoners of conscience their vital organs including kidneys livers corneas and hearts were seized involuntarily for sale at high prices sometimes to foreigners who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries they estimated that from 2000 to 2005 the source for 41500 organ transplants was unexplained and that falun gong prisoners were the most plausible source for these organs    the authors qualified their report by noting the inherent difficulties in verifying the alleged crimes no independent organizations are allowed to investigate conditions in china eyewitness evidence is difficult to obtain and official information about both organ transplantation and executions is often withheld or is contradictory  in 2007 kilgour and matas presented an updated report under the title bloody harvest revised report into allegations of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in china the findings were subsequently rewritten as a book released in october 2009  the reports received international media coverage and the authors travelled internationally to present their findings to governments and other concerned organizations ethan gutmann an investigative journalist and author specializing in china initiated his own investigation into the allegations of organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners in 2006 over the span of several years he conducted interviews with over 100 refugees from chinas labor camp and prison system as well as with chinese law enforcement personnel and medical professionals  based on his research gutmann concluded that organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience became prevalent in the northwestern province of xinjiang during the 1990s when members of the uyghur ethnic group were targeted in security crackdowns and strike hard campaigns   by 1999 gutmann says that organ harvesting in xinjiang began to decline precipitously just as overall rates of organ transplantation nationwide were rising the same year the chinese government launched a nationwide suppression of the falun gong spiritual group gutmann suggests that the new falun gong prisoner population overtook uyghurs as a major source of organs  he estimated that approximately 65000 falun gong practitioners had been killed for their organs between 2000 and 2008 and notes that this figure is similar to that produced by kilgour and matas when adjusted to cover the same time period   these findings have been published in a variety of journals and periodicals including the world affairs journal the weekly standard the toronto star and the national review among others gutmann has also provided testimony on his findings before us congress and european parliament and in august 2014 published his investigation as a book titled the slaughter mass killings organ harvesting and chinas secret solution to its dissident problem  several distinct strands of evidence have been presented to support allegations that falun gong practitioners have been killed for their organs in china researchers human rights advocates and medical advocacy groups have focused in particular on the volume of organ transplants performed in china the disparity between the number of transplants and known sources of organs the significant growth in the transplant industry coinciding with the mass imprisonment of falun gong practitioners short wait times that suggest an on demand execution schedule and reports that falun gong prisoners are given medical exams in custody to assess their candidacy as organ suppliers the number of organ transplants performed in china grew rapidly beginning in 2000 this timeframe corresponds with the onset of the persecution of falun gong when tens of thousands of falun gong practitioners were being sent to chinese labor camps detention centers and prisons in 1998 the country reported 3596 kidney transplants annually by 2005 that number had risen to approximately 10000  the number of facilities performing kidney transplants increased from 106 to 368 between 2001 and 2005 similarly from 1999 to 2006 the number of liver transplantation centers in china rose from 22 to over 500  the volume of transplants performed in these centers also increased substantially in this period one hospital reported on its website that it performed 9 liver transplants in 1998 but completed 647 liver transplants in four months in 2005 the jiaotong university hospital in shanghai recorded seven liver transplants in 2001 53 in 2002 105 in 2003 144 in 2004 and 147 in 2005  kilgour and matas write that the increase in organ transplants cannot be entirely attributed to improvements in transplant technology kidney transplant technology was fully developed in china long before the persecution of falun gong began yet kidney transplants shot up more than doubling once the persecution of falun gong startednowhere have transplants jumped so significantly with the same number of donors simply because of a change in technology  furthermore they note that during this period of rapid expansion in chinas organ transplant industry there were no significant improvements to the voluntary organ donation or allocation system and the supply of death row inmates as donors also did not increase   although it does not prove the allegations the parallel between rapid growth in organ transplants and the mass imprisonment of falun gong practitioners is consistent with the hypothesis that falun gong practitioners in custody were having their organs harvested chinese officials reported in 2005 that up to 95 of organ transplants are sourced from prisoners  however china does not perform enough legal executions to account for the large number of transplants that are performed and voluntary donations are exceedingly rare only 130 people registered as voluntary organ donors nationwide from 2003 to 2009  chinese health officials reported that over 13000 organ transplants were performed in china in 2004  by 2006 the staterun china daily newspaper reported that 20000 organ transplants were performed annually  in the same time period the number of individuals sentenced to death and executed was far fewer than the number of transplants based on publicly available reports amnesty international documented 1770 executions in 2006 highend estimates put the figure closer to 8000  because china lacks an organized organ matching and allocation system and in order to satisfy expectations for very short wait times it is rare that multiple organs are harvested from the same donor moreover many death row inmates have health conditions such as hepatitis b that would frequently disqualify them as organ donors this suggests the existence of a secondary source for organs  united nations special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak says the explanation that most of these organs come from death row inmates is inconclusiveif so the number of executed felons must then be much higher as so far assumed  in a statement before the us house of representatives dr damon noto said the prisoners sentenced to death cannot fully account for all the transplantations that are taking place in china  even if they executed 10000 and transplanted 10000 a year there would still be a very large discrepancy why is that it is simply impossible that those 10000 people executed would match perfectly the 10000 people that needed the organs  david kilgour and david matas similarly write that traditional sources of transplants such as executed prisoners donors and the brain dead come nowhere near to explaining the total number of transplants across china like noto they point to the large number of falun gong practitioners in the labor camp and prison system as a likely alternative source for organs  wait periods for organ transplants in china are significantly shorter than elsewhere in the world according to a 2006 post on the china international transplantation assistance center website it may take only one month to receive a liver transplantation  the maximum waiting time being two months as for the kidney transplantation  it may take one week to find a suitable donorthe maximum time being one monthif something wrong with the donors organ happens the patient will have the option to be offered another organ donor and have the operation again in one week  other organ transplant centers similarly advertised average wait times of one or two weeks for liver and kidney transplants    this is consistent with accounts of organ transplant recipients who report receiving organs a matter of days or weeks    by comparison median wait times for a kidney in developed countries such as the united states canada and great britain typically range from two years to over four years despite the fact that these countries have millions of registered organ donors and established systems of organ matching and allocation    researchers and medical professionals have expressed concern about the implications of the short organ transplant wait times offered by chinese hospitals specifically they say these wait times are indicative of a pool of living donors whose organs can be removed on demand  this is because organs must be transplanted immediately after death or must be taken from a living donor kidneys must be transplanted within 2448 hours livers within 12 hours and hearts within 8 hours  dr kirk c allison associate director of the program in human rights and medicine at the university of minnesota wrote that the short time frame of an ondemand system as in china requires a large pool of donors pretyped for blood group and hla matching which is consistent with reports of falun gong prisoners having blood and tissue tested in custody he wrote that chinas short organ wait times could not be assured on a random death basis and that physicians he queried about the matter indicated that they were selecting live prisoners to ensure quality and compatibility  dr jacob lavee director of the heart transplant unit at the sheba medical center in israel recounts one of his patients traveling to china for a heart transplant the patient waited two weeks for a heart and the surgery was scheduled in advancemeaning the organ could not have been procured on the basis of a random death  dr franz immer chairman of the swiss national foundation for organ donation and transplantation reports that during a visit to beijing in 2007 he was invited by his chinese hosts to observe a heart transplantation operation the organizer asked us whether we would like to have the transplantation operation in the morning or in the afternoon this means that the donor would die or be killed at a given time at the convenience of the visitors i refused to participate  editors of the journal of clinical investigation write that the only way to guarantee transplant of a liver or heart during the relatively short time period that a transplant tourist is in china is to quickly obtain the requisite medical information from prospective recipients find matches among them and then execute a person who is a suitable match  dr noto similarly says that chinas organ transplant wait times and the ability to schedule transplants in advance can only be achieved by having a large supply of living donors that are available on demand death row inmates alone are not numerous enough to meet this demand and under chinese law they must be executed within one week of sentencing  since 1999 hundreds of thousands of falun gong practitioners have been detained in reeducation through labor camps prisons and other detention facilities in china making them the largest group of prisoners of conscience in the country  in 2008 the us department of state cited estimates that half of chinas official labor camp population of 250000 were falun gong practitioners   and a 2013 report by amnesty international found that falun gong practitioners comprised between 30 to 100 percent of detainees in the labor camps studied  former chinese prisoners have also reported that falun gong practitioners consistently received the longest sentences and worst treatment in the camps and that they are singled out for torture and abuse   in 2006 a study by the uns special rapporteur on torture noted that 66 of reported cases from china involved falun gong victims  thousands of falun gong practitioners have died or been killed in custody often under disputed circumstances   family members of the deceased have reported being denied an autopsy  in some instances bodies were summarily cremated without the familys consent  analysts and rights groups have pointed to several factors that drive the especially severe treatment against falun gong practitioners in custody these include directives issued from central government or communist party authorities  incentives and quota systems that encourage abuse  a sense of impunity in the event of deaths in custody  and the effects of the state propaganda that dehumanizes and vilifies falun gong practitioners   the large numbers of falun gong prisoners in custody has led researchers to identify them as a likely source for organs according to gutmanns research other marginalized prisoner groups may also have been targeted including ethnic tibetans and uyghurs who reside predominantly in chinas western regions however for reasons of geographic proximity falun gong practitioners are more likely to be targeted in addition because their spiritual practice prohibits smoking or consumption of alcohol they tend to be comparatively healthy  in the context of organ harvesting kilgour and matas point to a further source of vulnerability namely in order to protect family members from punishment by security agencies many detained falun gong practitioners refuse to give their names or other personally identifying information to police though this refusal to identify themselves was done for protection purposes it may have had the opposite effect it is easier to victimize a person whose whereabouts is unknown to family members than a person whose location the family knows says their report kilgour and matas wrote that they had yet to meet or hear of any falun gong practitioners who were safely released from custody after refusing to identify themselves despite the prevalence of this practice  similarly ethan gutmann reports that in over a hundred interviews with former prisoners he encountered only one falun gong practitioners who had remained nameless while in custody and her organs were even more worn out than my own  ethan gutmann interviewed dozens former chinese prisoners including sixteen falun gong practitioners who recalled undergoing unusual medical tests while in detention gutmann says some of these tests were likely routine examinations and some may have been designed to screen for the sars virus however in several cases the medical tests described were exclusively aimed at assessing the health of internal organs  one man wang xiaohua was imprisoned in a labor camp in yunnan in 2001 when he and twenty other falun gong detainees were taken to a hospital they had large quantities of blood drawn in addition to urine samples abdominal xrays and electrocardiogram hospital staff did not tend to physical injuries they had suffered in custody this pattern was repeated in several other interviews qu yangyao a 30something chinese refugee was taken from labor camp to a hospital in 2000 along with two other falun gong practitioners she says that hospital staff drew large volumes of blood conducted chest xrays and probed the prisoners organs there was no hammer on the knee no feeling for lymph nodes no examination of ears or mouth or genitalsthe doctor checked her retail organs and nothing else writes gutmann  another woman jung tian recounts comprehensive physical exams and the extraction of large volumes of bloodenough for advanced diagnostics or tissue matchingwhile in a detention center in shenyang city at a womens labor camp in guangdong province a former detainee says that 180 falun gong prisoners were subject to medical tests in early 2003 and that the tests exclusively focused on internal organs another female witness who was held at masanjia labor camp in 2005 said that only young healthy practitioners had comprehensive medical exams upon arrival at the camp the old and infirm were given only cursory treatment  in addition to falun gong practitioners researcher jaya gibson identified three tibetan prisoners who were subject to organsonly medical exams all of them shortly after 2005  in march 2006 immediately after allegations emerged that falun gong prisoners were being targeted for organ harvesting overseas investigators began placing phone calls to chinese hospitals and police detention centers the callers posed as prospective transplant recipients or organ brokers and inquired about the availability of falun gong organs in several instances they obtained recorded admissions that organs could be procured from falun gong prisoners a selection of these conversations were cited as evidence in the report by david kilgour and david matas   in one such call to a police detention center in mishan city an official said that they had five to eight falun gong practitioners under the age of 40 who were potential organ suppliers when asked for details on the background of these individuals the official indicated that they were male falun gong prisoners from rural areas  a doctor at the minzu hospital in nanning city said that the hospital did not currently have falun gong organs available but that he had previously selected falun gong prisoners for organ harvesting the doctor also advised the caller to contact a university hospital in neighboring guangdong province saying that they had better channels to obtain falun gong organs  at the zhongshan hospital in shanghai a doctor told investigators that all his hospitals organs were sourced from falun gong practitioners during an april 2006 phone call to a military hospital in guangzhou a doctor told investigators that he had several batches of falun gong organs but that the supply could run dry after may 20 2006 in another call investigators posed as an organ broker to call the jinzhou city peoples court in response to a question about obtaining organs from falun gong prisoners a court official said that depends on your qualificationsif you have good qualifications we may still provide some organs  kilgour and matas concede that in at least some instances the hospital staff may have been supplying answers that the callers wanted to hear in order to make a sale the results of these phone calls would also be difficult to replicate as allegations of organ harvesting from falun gong gained attention hospitals would become more reluctant to candidly discuss their organ sourcing practices  this investigative tactic was revived in 2012 when communist party officials began investigating politburo member bo xilai for a variety of crimes bo had previously been governor of liaoning province which researchers believe was a major center for organ harvesting the world organization to investigate the persecution of falun gong made phone calls to mid and highlevel officials with prior connections to bo posing as members of the internal communist party discipline and inspection group that was building the case against him they asked questions about the chain of command involved in procuring organs from prisoners including falun gong prisoners when asked about bo xilais involvement in organ harvesting one highranking member of the politburo reportedly told investigators that politburo standing committee member and security czar zhou yongkang is in charge of this specifically he knows it  a citylevel official in liaoning province was asked by investigators what direction bo xilai may have given regarding removing organs from falun gong prisoners the official replied i was asked to take care of this task party central is actually taking care of thishe bo was involved quite positively yeah it seemed quite positive at that time we mainly talked about it during the meetings within the standing committee the official hung up after realizing that he had not confirmed the identity of the caller  another phone call recipient was a medical doctor at a military hospital in liaoning when asked about whether falun gong practitioners organs were ever used in transplant operations at a nearby hospital the official answered in the affirmative all that was processed through the court the doctor soon grew uncomfortable with the line of questioning and refused to discuss the issue further without clearance from the hospitals political division  human rights researchers and medical practitioners have argued that the commercial nature of the organ trade in china promotes corruption and abuse namely the profits to be made from selling organs may lead to more killingsboth courtsanctioned and extrajudicialthan would otherwise occur although this argument is not specific to the falun gong practitioners it has been used as circumstantial evidence to support claims that falun gong prisoners could be targeted for organ harvesting the growth of a commercial organ trade is linked to economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s that saw a steep decline in government funding to the healthcare system healthcare moved toward a more marketdriven model and hospitals devised new ways to grow their revenue this pattern also applies to military hospitals since the mid1980s the peoples liberation army has engaged in commercial and profitmaking ventures to supplement its budget   in their report on organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners kilgour and matas describe transplant hospitals in china that cater to wealthy foreigners who paid upwards of 100000 for liver lung and heart transplants for instance the website of the china international transplantation network assistance center posted the following price list on its website in 2006 kidney 62000 liver 98000130000 liverkidney 160000180000 kidneypancreas 150000 lung 150000170000 heart 130000160000 cornea 30000  in a statement before the us house of representatives dr gabriel danovitch of the ucla medical center said the ease in which these organs can be obtained and the manner that they may be allocated to wealthy foreigners has engendered a culture of corruption  in his book on organ transplant abuse ethan gutmann included a case study centered on chinas northeastern liaoning province former politburo member bo xilai served as mayor and party chief of dalian city liaoning in the 1990s and later was made governor from 2001 to 2004 the province is known to have a high concentration of falun gong practitioners and leads the country in reported falun gong deaths in custody  several observers have noted that bo xilai pursued an especially intense campaign against falun gong in the province leading to charges of torture and crimes against humanity    bos close associate wang lijun was named head of the public security bureau in jinzhou liaoning in 2003 in this capacity he ran an organ transplantation facility where he reportedly oversaw several thousand organ transplants leading to concerns that many of the organs were taken from political prisoners   during a 2006 award ceremony wang told reporters for a veteran policeman to see someone executed and within minutes to see the transformation in which this persons life was extended in the bodies of several other peopleit was soulstirring  gutmann says it is extremely unlikely that all the organs used in these operations were taken from executed deathrow prisoners who would not have been plentiful enough to supply thousands of organ transplants however gutmann notes that liaoning detained large numbers of falun gong practitioners in labor camps and prisons it is also germane that both bo xilai and wang lijun built a large measure of their political power on the repression of falun gong he writes   dr huige li a spokesperson with the medical advocacy group doctors against forced organ harvesting reiterated this point in his 2015 testimony before european parliament by lis calculations a city the size of jinzhou could be expected to perform roughly 14 legally sanctioned executions in the time period in question meaning that the source for thousands of transplant operations at the centre was unaccounted for  in addition to organ transplants in jinzhou gutmann notes that security agencies in dalian city were supplying human cadavers to two major plastination factories where the bodies are filled with plastics to be sent on display around the world as bodies exhibitions according to an informant interviewed on the program 2020 the plastinated cadavers came from executed prisoners again however gutmann notes a disparity in the numbers the body plastination factories operating in dalian processed thousands of cadaversfar more than could be expected to be donated or taken from legally executed prisoners the establishment of the body plastination factories coincided with the onset of the persecution of falun gong  the chinese government has repeatedly and categorically denied that falun gong practitioners have been killed for their organs and insists that it adheres to world health organization standards however the government has not refuted the specific points of evidence cited by researchers nor provided an alternative explanation for the source of organs used in transplants  in response to a 2014 resolution on organ harvesting by the us house of representatives a chinese embassy spokesperson said that china requires written consent from organ donors and declared that the socalled organ harvesting from deathrow prisoners is totally a lie fabricated by falun gong the embassy representative then urged american lawmakers to stop supporting and conniving with falun gong  david kilgour and david matas say that the chinese governments response to their investigation in 2006 contained a good deal of invective but no factual information which contradicts or undermines our conclusions or analysis in particular the chinese government response centered on the charge that falun gong is an evil cult questioned the motives and independence of the researchers and noted a captioning error where their report had mislabeled the location of two chinese cities the governments response also stated that china prohibits the sale of human organs and requires written consent of the donorclaims which kilgour and matas say are belied by the evidence  from 2006 to 2008 two un special rapporteurs made repeated requests to the chinese government to respond to allegations about falun gong prisoners and explain the source of organs used in transplant operations   the chinese governments responses did not address these questions or explain the sources of transplant organs instead it wrote china is in compliance with world health organization standards and described the conditions under which organ transplants are permitted under chinese laws and regulations it further stated that allegations of organ harvesting are merely the product of agitation by falun gongmost of them have already been revealed to be unfounded rumours  the chinese government also has sought to prevent public discussion of the issue outside its own borders and has punished chinese nationals who have spoken on the subject of organ harvesting in may 2006 european parliament vice president edward mcmillanscott went to china on a factfinding mission to investigate human rights violations his tour guide cao dong said he knew of organ harvesting and had seen his falun gong practitioner friends cadaver in the morgue with holes where body parts had been removed  cao dong was sentenced to five years in prison for speaking with the european union official  in 2007 the chinese embassy in canada intervened to cancel the broadcast of a documentary on falun gong and organ harvesting which was scheduled to air on the national broadcast network cbc television  the same year the chinese embassy in israel tried unsuccessfully to cancel a talk by researcher david matas on the subject of organ harvesting threatening that his testimony would have an adverse impact on chinaisrael relations  allegations about organ harvesting from falun gong led to renewed focus on chinas transplant practices by international medical authorities and professional associations medical professionals have raised a number of concerns stemming from the use of prisoner organs and have debated the ethics of conducting exchanges with chinese transplant hospitals in 2006 the world medical association adopted a resolution demanding that china stop using prisoners as organ donors  the us national kidney foundation said it was profoundly worried by the coercive methods used to obtain organs and tissues as described in the recent allegations  since 2011 several medical journals have declared that they would cease publishing articles related to organ transplantation operations in china due to concerns about violations of medical ethics the journal of clinical investigation a prestigious publication on biomedical research declared that chinas use of organs from executed prisoners violates basic human rights it violates core ethical precepts of transplant medicine and medical ethics worse still some of those who are killed may be prisoners whose crimes involve no more than holding certain political or spiritual beliefs the journal decided that it would no longer accept manuscripts on human organ transplantation unless appropriate noncoerced consent of the donor is provided and substantiated  a similar decision was taken by the american journal of transplantation ajt  writing in the lancet in 2011 a group of prominent american surgeons and bioethicists called for a boycott of chinese science and medicine pertaining to organ transplantation it is clear from the numbers provided by china that not all of the organs for chinese citizens and transplant tourists are provided by voluntary consenting donors the source of many of these organs is executed prisoners whose consent is either nonexistent or ethically invalid and whose demise might be timed for the convenience of the waiting recipient they wrote  the articles lead author dr arthur caplan later added killing prisoners for their parts is unethical on its own but the practice is even more heinous given that some of the executed prisoners were imprisoned for religious or political beliefs   from 2006 to 2008 two un special rapporteurs made repeated requests to the chinese government to respond to allegations about falun gong prisoners and explain the source of organs used in transplant operations  in a february 2008 report un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak noted that in china there are many more organ transplants than identifiable sources of organs  it is alleged that the discrepancy between available organs and numbers from identifiable sources is explained by organs harvested from falun gong practitioners and that the rise in transplants from 2000 coincides and correlates with the beginning of the persecution of these persons  the chinese governments responses did not address these questions or explain the sources of transplant organs  nowak later said that the chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparentthe chinese government has not invalidated the allegations but on the other hand they havent been proven either this makes for a difficult dilemmaone that can only be resolved if china is willing to cooperate and that is what is lacking  several national governments have held hearings in their national legislatures regarding organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners with some of them subsequently adopting resolutions condemning organ transplant abuses in china or developing legislation to ban transplant tourism in july 2014 the foreign affairs subcommittee of the us house of representatives unanimously adopted a resolution condemning statesanctioned organ harvesting from falun gong prisoners of conscience and members of other minority groups   the allegations have also surfaced in reports by the congressionalexecutive commission on china  and in the department of state country report on human rights for china for 2011  in january 2015 the white house responded to a petition signed by 34000 americans condemning organ harvesting from falun gong prisoners the response noted that chinas leaders have announced a pledge to abolish the practice of taking human organs for transplant from executed prisoners although we are aware of continued reports of such practices we take such allegations very seriously and will continue to monitor the situation  the european parliament heard testimony about organ harvesting in china during a december 6 2012 session on human rights in china one year later it passed a resolution expressing deep concern over the persistent and credible reports of systematic statesanctioned organ harvesting from nonconsenting prisoners of conscience in the peoples republic of china including from large numbers of falun gong practitioners imprisoned for their religious beliefs as well as from members of other religious and ethnic minority groups the resolution called for the immediate release of all prisoners of conscience and urged chinese authorities to respond to united nations inquiries about the source of organs used in transplants  in march 2014 the european economic and social committee in brussels convened a followup event on organ transplant abuses in china  participants and speakers at the session endorsed the recommendations of the parliamentary resolution which recognized that falun gong and other minority groups are targets of forced organ harvesting in china eesc president henri malosse called for greater pressure to be put on the chinese government to end organ transplant abuses  in march 2014 the members of the italian commission on human rights unanimously adopted a resolution calling for the immediate release of falun gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience in china and urging italian hospitals to reconsider collaborations with china in the area of organ transplants  in 2015 the italian senate adopted a bill which makes it a crime to traffic in organs from living donors individuals found guilty of this offence could face 312 years in prison and fines of up to 300000 euros  senator maurizio romani one of the bills sponsors noted that china performs the second highest number of transplants in the world all without established procedures for organ donation or a national organ allocation system and said that falun gong practitioners account for a significant portion of transplant organs we in italy cant stop these violations but we have the duty to make any effort in order not to be accomplices to this he said  in december 2006 the australian ministry of health revealed that two of the countrys major organ transplant hospitals had banned training of chinese surgeons in response to concerns about organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners and other prisoners  on march 21 2013 the australian senate unanimously passed a motion concerning reports of organ harvesting in china   the motion which was introduced one day after a parliamentary briefing on the subject of organ harvesting from falun gong prisoners called on australia to adopt strict standards to address the practice of international organ trafficking  the same year green party lawmakers in new south wales australia proposed legislation to criminalize and create specific offenses related to trafficking in human organs and tissue  in 2007 israels national legislative body the knesset adopted new legislation barring insurance companies from providing coverage to israeli citizens who travel abroad to purchase organs the move was partly a response to an investigation in which israeli authorities arrested several men involved in mediating transplants of chinese prisoners organs for israelis one of the men had stated in an undercover interview that the organs came from people who oppose the regime those sentenced to death and from prisoners of the falun gong  in addition to prohibiting citizens from buying organs overseas the law also imposed criminal charges on organ traffickers the new rules resulted in a significant decrease in the number of israeli citizens seeking transplants abroad while also helping to catalyze an expansion of the voluntary donor registry domestically  in 2010 spain implemented a law prohibiting its nationals from traveling abroad to obtain illegal organ transplants the legislation was proposed after a spanish citizen reportedly traveled to tianjin china where he obtained a liver for 130000 usd after waiting for just 20 days the spanish legislation makes it a crime to promote or facilitate an illegal organ transplant punishable with up to 12 years in prison in addition any organization found to have participated in illegal organ transplant transactions will be subject to a fine  in june 2015 the national legislature of taiwan passed an amendment to the human organ transplantation act to prohibit the sale or purchase of organs including from abroad the law also prohibits the use of organs from executed prisoners legislators who supported the bill noted that the amendments were intended to address the problem of taiwanese citizens traveling to china to purchase organs some of which were harvested from living donors  similar bills against organ tourism have been proposed in the french national assembly 2010 and in canadian parliament 2007 2013    the government of canada has also raised the issue of organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners at the united nations during the universal periodic review process in 2014

V heart failure hf often referred to as congestive heart failure chf occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the bodys needs    the terms chronic heart failure chf or congestive cardiac failure ccf are often used interchangeably with congestive heart failure  signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath excessive tiredness and leg swelling  the shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise while lying down and may wake the person at night  a limited ability to exercise is also a common feature  common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease including a previous myocardial infarction heart attack high blood pressure atrial fibrillation valvular heart disease excess alcohol use infection and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause   these cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the functioning of the heart  there are two main types of heart failure heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure with normal ejection fraction depending on if the ability of the left ventricle to contract is affected or the hearts ability to relax  the severity of disease is usually graded by the degree of problems with exercise  heart failure is not the same as myocardial infarction in which part of the heart muscle dies or cardiac arrest in which blood flow stops altogether   other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity kidney failure liver problems anemia and thyroid disease  the condition is diagnosed based on the history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography  blood tests electrocardiography and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause  treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease  in people with chronic stable mild heart failure treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking  physical exercise  and dietary changes as well as medications  in those with heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers along with beta blockers are recommended  for those with severe disease aldosterone antagonists or hydralazine with a nitrate may be used  diuretics are useful for preventing fluid retention  sometimes depending on the cause an implanted device such as a pacemaker or an implantable cardiac defibrillator may be recommended  in some moderate or severe cases cardiac resynchronization therapy crt may be suggested  or cardiac contractility modulation may be of benefit  a ventricular assist device or occasionally a heart transplant may be recommended in those with severe disease despite all other measures  heart failure is a common costly and potentially fatal condition  in developed countries around 2 of adults have heart failure and in those over the age of 65 this increases to 610   in the year after diagnosis the risk of death is about 35 after which it decreases to below 10 each year  this is similar to the risks with a number of types of cancer  in the united kingdom the disease is the reason for 5 of emergency hospital admissions  heart failure has been known since ancient times with the ebers papyrus commenting on it around 1550 bce  heart failure is a physiological state in which cardiac output is insufficient to meet the needs of the body and lungs the term congestive heart failure is often used as one of the common symptoms is congestion that is buildup of too much fluid in tissues and veins  specifically congestion takes the form of water retention and swelling edema both as peripheral edema causing swollen limbs and feet and as pulmonary edema causing breathing difficulty as well as ascites swollen abdomen heart failure is divided into two different types heart failure due to reduced ejection fraction also known as heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction or systolic heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfpef also known as diastolic heart failure or heart failure with normal ejection fraction   heart failure with reduced ejection fraction occurs when the ejection fraction is less than 40  in diastolic heart failure the heart muscle contracts well but the ventricle does not fill with blood well in the relaxation phase  ejection fraction is the proportion of blood pumped out of the heart during a single contraction  it is given as a percentage with the normal range being between 50 and 75  the term acute is used to mean rapid onset and chronic refers to long duration chronic heart failure is a long term condition usually kept stable by the treatment of symptoms acute decompensated heart failure is a worsening of chronic heart failure symptoms which can result in acute respiratory distress  highoutput heart failure can occur when there is an increased cardiac output the circulatory overload caused can result in an increased left ventricular diastolic pressure which can develop into pulmonary congestion pulmonary edema  heart failure symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into left and right sided recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the heart supply different portions of the circulation however heart failure is not exclusively backward failure in the part of the circulation which drains to the ventricle there are several other exceptions to a simple leftright division of heart failure symptoms additionally the most common cause of rightsided heart failure is leftsided heart failure  the result is that patients commonly present with both sets of signs and symptoms the left side of the heart is responsible for receiving oxygenrich blood from the lungs and pumping it forward to the systemic circulation the rest of the body except for the pulmonary circulation failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up be congested into the lungs causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood common respiratory signs are increased rate of breathing and increased work of breathing nonspecific signs of respiratory distress rales or crackles heard initially in the lung bases and when severe throughout the lung fields suggest the development of pulmonary edema fluid in the alveoli cyanosis which suggests severe low blood oxygen is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced apex beat which occurs if the heart is enlarged and a gallop rhythm additional heart sounds may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intracardiac pressure heart murmurs may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease either as a cause eg aortic stenosis or as a result eg mitral regurgitation of the heart failure backward failure of the left ventricle causes congestion of the lungs blood vessels and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature backward failure can be subdivided into failure of the left atrium the left ventricle or both within the left circuit the patient will have dyspnea shortness of breath on exertion and in severe cases dyspnea at rest increasing breathlessness on lying flat called orthopnea occurs it is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably and in orthopnea the patient may resort to sleeping while sitting up another symptom of heart failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness usually several hours after going to sleep easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise cardiac asthma or wheezing may occur compromise of left ventricular forward function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as dizziness confusion and cool extremities at rest rightsided heart failure is often caused by pulmonary heart disease cor pulmonale which is usually caused by difficulties of the pulmonary circulation such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonic stenosis physical examination may reveal pitting peripheral edema ascites and liver enlargement jugular venous pressure is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status which can be accentuated by eliciting hepatojugular reflux if the right ventricular pressure is increased a parasternal heave may be present signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength backward failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries this generates excess fluid accumulation in the body this causes swelling under the skin termed peripheral edema or anasarca and usually affects the dependent parts of the body first causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up and sacral edema in people who are predominantly lying down nocturia frequent nighttime urination may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night in progressively severe cases ascites fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling and liver enlargement may develop significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function and jaundice and even coagulopathy problems of decreased blood clotting may occur dullness of the lung fields to finger percussion and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a pleural effusion fluid collection between the lung and the chest wall though it can occur in isolated left or rightsided heart failure it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems when unilateral effusions are often right sided if a person with failure of one ventricle lives long enough it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles for example left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension to occur which increase stress on the right ventricle right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the other side but neither is it harmless heart failure may also occur in situations of high output termed highoutput heart failure where the ventricular systolic function is normal but the heart cannot deal with an important augmentation of blood volume  this can occur in overload situation blood or serum infusions kidney diseases chronic severe anemia beriberi vitamin b1thiamine deficiency hyperthyroidism pagets disease arteriovenous fistulae or arteriovenous malformations viral infections of the heart can lead to inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure heart damage can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections eg hiv chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin and trastuzumab and abuse of drugs such as alcohol and methamphetamine additionally infiltrative disorders such as amyloidosis and connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus have similar consequences obstructive sleep apnea a condition of sleep wherein disordered breathing overlaps with obesity hypertension andor diabetes is regarded as an independent cause of heart failure chronic stable heart failure may easily decompensate this most commonly results from an intercurrent illness such as pneumonia myocardial infarction a heart attack abnormal heart rhythms uncontrolled hypertension or a patients failure to maintain a fluid restriction diet or medication  other well recognized factors that may worsen chf include the following anemia and hyperthyroidism which place additional strain on the heart muscle excessive fluid or salt intake and medication that causes fluid retention such as nsaids and thiazolidinediones  nsaids in general increase the risk twofold  heart failure is caused by any condition which reduces the efficiency of the heart muscle through damage or overloading as such it can be caused by a wide number of conditions including myocardial infarction in which the heart muscle is starved of oxygen and dies hypertension which increases the force of contraction needed to pump blood and amyloidosis in which misfolded proteins are deposited in the heart muscle causing it to stiffen over time these increases in workload will produce changes to the heart itself the heart of a person with heart failure may have a reduced force of contraction due to overloading of the ventricle in a healthy heart increased filling of the ventricle results in increased contraction force by the frankstarling law of the heart and thus a rise in cardiac output in heart failure this mechanism fails as the ventricle is loaded with blood to the point where heart muscle contraction becomes less efficient this is due to reduced ability to crosslink actin and myosin filaments in overstretched heart muscle  a reduced stroke volume may occur as a result of a failure of systole diastole or both increased end systolic volume is usually caused by reduced contractility decreased end diastolic volume results from impaired ventricular filling this occurs when the compliance of the ventricle falls ie when the walls stiffen as the heart works harder to meet normal metabolic demands the amount cardiac output can increase in times of increased oxygen demand eg exercise is reduced this contributes to the exercise intolerance commonly seen in heart failure this translates to the loss of ones cardiac reserve or the ability of the heart to work harder during strenuous physical activity since the heart has to work harder to meet the normal metabolic demands it is incapable of meeting the metabolic demands of the body during exercise a common finding in those with heart failure is an increased heart rate stimulated by increased sympathetic activity  in order to maintain an adequate cardiac output initially this helps compensate for heart failure by maintaining blood pressure and perfusion but places further strain on the myocardium increasing coronary perfusion requirements which can lead to worsening of ischemic heart disease sympathetic activity may also cause potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythms an increase in the physical size of the hearts muscular layer may occur this is caused by the terminally differentiated heart muscle fibers increasing in size in an attempt to improve contractility this may contribute to the increased stiffness and decreased ability to relax during diastole enlargement of the ventricles can also occur and contributes to the enlargement and spherical shape of the failing heart the increase in ventricular volume also causes a reduction in stroke volume due to mechanical and inefficient contraction of the heart  the general effect is one of reduced cardiac output and increased strain on the heart this increases the risk of cardiac arrest specifically due to abnormal ventricular heart rhythms and reduces blood supply to the rest of the body in chronic disease the reduced cardiac output causes a number of changes in the rest of the body some of which are physiological compensations some of which are part of the disease process the increased peripheral resistance and greater blood volume place further strain on the heart and accelerates the process of damage to the myocardium vasoconstriction and fluid retention produce an increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries this shifts the balance of forces in favour of interstitial fluid formation as the increased pressure forces additional fluid out of the blood into the tissue this results in edema fluid buildup in the tissues in rightsided heart failure this commonly starts in the ankles where venous pressure is high due to the effects of gravity although if the patient is bedridden fluid accumulation may begin in the sacral region it may also occur in the abdominal cavity where the fluid buildup is called ascites in leftsided heart failure edema can occur in the lungs  this is called cardiogenic pulmonary edema this reduces spare capacity for ventilation causes stiffening of the lungs and reduces the efficiency of gas exchange by increasing the distance between the air and the blood the consequences of this are dyspnea shortness of breath orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea the symptoms of heart failure are largely determined by which side of the heart fails the left side pumps blood into the systemic circulation whilst the right side pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation whilst leftsided heart failure will reduce cardiac output to the systemic circulation the initial symptoms often manifest due to effects on the pulmonary circulation in systolic dysfunction the ejection fraction is decreased leaving an abnormally elevated volume of blood in the left ventricle in diastolic dysfunction enddiastolic ventricular pressure will be high this increase in volume or pressure backs up to the left atrium and then to the pulmonary veins increased volume or pressure in the pulmonary veins impairs the normal drainage of the alveoli and favors the flow of fluid from the capillaries to the lung parenchyma causing pulmonary edema this impairs gas exchange thus leftsided heart failure often presents with respiratory symptoms shortness of breath orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in severe cardiomyopathy the effects of decreased cardiac output and poor perfusion become more apparent and patients will manifest with cold and clammy extremities cyanosis claudication generalized weakness dizziness and fainting the resultant low blood oxygen caused by pulmonary edema causes vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation which results in pulmonary hypertension since the right ventricle generates far lower pressures than the left ventricle approximately 20 mmhg versus around 120 mmhg respectively in the healthy individual but nonetheless generates cardiac output exactly equal to the left ventricle this means that a small increase in pulmonary vascular resistance causes a large increase in amount of work the right ventricle must perform however the main mechanism by which leftsided heart failure causes rightsided heart failure is actually not well understood some theories invoke mechanisms that are mediated by neurohormonal activation  mechanical effects may also contribute as the left ventricle distends the intraventricular septum bows into the right ventricle decreasing the capacity of the right ventricle heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is more readily recognized it can be simplistically described as failure of the pump function of the heart it is characterized by a decreased ejection fraction less than 45 the strength of ventricular contraction is attenuated and inadequate for creating an adequate stroke volume resulting in inadequate cardiac output in general this is caused by dysfunction or destruction of cardiac myocytes or their molecular components in congenital diseases such as duchenne muscular dystrophy the molecular structure of individual myocytes is affected myocytes and their components can be damaged by inflammation such as in myocarditis or by infiltration such as in amyloidosis toxins and pharmacological agents such as ethanol cocaine doxorubicin and amphetamines cause intracellular damage and oxidative stress the most common mechanism of damage is ischemia causing infarction and scar formation after myocardial infarction dead myocytes are replaced by scar tissue deleteriously affecting the function of the myocardium on echocardiogram this is manifest by abnormal wall motion hypokinesia or absent wall motion akinesia because the ventricle is inadequately emptied ventricular enddiastolic pressure and volumes increase this is transmitted to the atrium on the left side of the heart the increased pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature and the resultant hydrostatic pressure favors extravasation of fluid into the lung parenchyma causing pulmonary edema on the right side of the heart the increased pressure is transmitted to the systemic venous circulation and systemic capillary beds favoring extravasation of fluid into the tissues of target organs and extremities resulting in dependent peripheral edema heart failure caused by diastolic dysfunction is generally described as the backward failure of the ventricle to adequately relax and typically denotes a stiffer ventricular wall the stiffness and contractility of the ventricular walls in diastole was first described by pierresimon laplace this causes inadequate filling of the ventricle and therefore results in an inadequate stroke volume sv sv is a mathematical term amenable to manipulation of many variables the failure of ventricular relaxation also results in elevated enddiastolic pressures and the end result is identical to the case of systolic dysfunction pulmonary edema in left heart failure peripheral edema in right heart failure diastolic dysfunction can be caused by processes similar to those that cause systolic dysfunction particularly causes that affect cardiac remodeling diastolic dysfunction may not manifest itself except in physiologic extremes if systolic function is preserved the patient may be completely asymptomatic at rest however they are exquisitely sensitive to increases in heart rate and sudden bouts of tachycardia which can be caused simply by physiological responses to exertion fever or dehydration or by pathological tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may result in flash pulmonary edema adequate rate control usually with a pharmacological agent that slows down av conduction such as a calcium channel blocker or a betablocker is therefore key to preventing decompensation left ventricular diastolic function can be determined through echocardiography by measurement of various parameters such as the ea ratio earlytoatrial left ventricular filling ratio the e early left ventricular filling deceleration time and the isovolumic relaxation time no system of diagnostic criteria has been agreed on as the gold standard for heart failure the national institute for health and care excellence recommends measuring brain natriuretic peptide followed by ultrasound of the heart if positive  echocardiography is commonly used to support a clinical diagnosis of heart failure this modality uses ultrasound to determine the stroke volume sv the amount of blood in the heart that exits the ventricles with each beat the enddiastolic volume edv the total amount of blood at the end of diastole and the sv in proportion to the edv a value known as the ejection fraction ef in pediatrics the shortening fraction is the preferred measure of systolic function normally the ef should be between 50 and 70 in systolic heart failure it drops below 40 echocardiography can also identify valvular heart disease and assess the state of the pericardium the connective tissue sac surrounding the heart echocardiography may also aid in deciding what treatments will help the patient such as medication insertion of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy echocardiography can also help determine if acute myocardial ischemia is the precipitating cause and may manifest as regional wall motion abnormalities on echo chest xrays are frequently used to aid in the diagnosis of chf in a person who is compensated this may show cardiomegaly visible enlargement of the heart quantified as the cardiothoracic ratio proportion of the heart size to the chest in left ventricular failure there may be evidence of vascular redistribution upper lobe blood diversion or cephalization kerley lines cuffing of the areas around the bronchi and interstitial edema ultrasound of the lung may also be able to detect kerley lines  an electrocardiogram ecgekg may be used to identify arrhythmias ischemic heart disease right and left ventricular hypertrophy and presence of conduction delay or abnormalities eg left bundle branch block although these findings are not specific to the diagnosis of heart failure a normal ecg virtually excludes left ventricular systolic dysfunction  blood tests routinely performed include electrolytes sodium potassium measures of kidney function liver function tests thyroid function tests a complete blood count and often creactive protein if infection is suspected an elevated btype natriuretic peptide bnp is a specific test indicative of heart failure additionally bnp can be used to differentiate between causes of dyspnea due to heart failure from other causes of dyspnea if myocardial infarction is suspected various cardiac markers may be used according to a metaanalysis comparing bnp and nterminal probnp ntprobnp in the diagnosis of heart failure bnp is a better indicator for heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction in groups of symptomatic patients a diagnostic odds ratio of 27 for bnp compares with a sensitivity of 85 and specificity of 84 in detecting heart failure  heart failure may be the result of coronary artery disease and its prognosis depends in part on the ability of the coronary arteries to supply blood to the myocardium heart muscle as a result coronary catheterization may be used to identify possibilities for revascularisation through percutaneous coronary intervention or bypass surgery various measures are often used to assess the progress of patients being treated for heart failure these include fluid balance calculation of fluid intake and excretion monitoring body weight which in the shorter term reflects fluid shifts  there are many different ways to categorize heart failure including functional classification generally relies on the new york heart association functional classification the classes iiv are this score documents severity of symptoms and can be used to assess response to treatment while its use is widespread the nyha score is not very reproducible and does not reliably predict the walking distance or exercise tolerance on formal testing  in its 2001 guidelines the american college of cardiologyamerican heart association working group introduced four stages of heart failure  the acc staging system is useful in that stage a encompasses preheart failure  a stage where intervention with treatment can presumably prevent progression to overt symptoms acc stage a does not have a corresponding nyha class acc stage b would correspond to nyha class i acc stage c corresponds to nyha class ii and iii while acc stage d overlaps with nyha class iv there are various algorithms for the diagnosis of heart failure for example the algorithm used by the framingham heart study adds together criteria mainly from physical examination in contrast the more extensive algorithm by the european society of cardiology esc weights the difference between supporting and opposing parameters from the medical history physical examination further medical tests as well as response to therapy by the framingham criteria diagnosis of congestive heart failure heart failure with impaired pumping capability  requires the simultaneous presence of at least 2 of the following major criteria or 1 major criterion in conjunction with 2 of the following minor criteria major criteria include an enlarged heart on a chest xray an s3 gallop a third heart sound acute pulmonary edema episodes of waking up from sleep gasping for air crackles on lung auscultation central venous pressure of more than 16cm h2o at the right atrium jugular vein distension positive abdominojugular test and weight loss of more than 45kg in 5 days in response to treatment sometimes  classified as a minor criterion  minor criteria include an abnormally fast heart rate of more than 120 beats per minute nocturnal cough difficulty breathing with physical activity pleural effusion a decrease in the vital capacity by one third from maximum recorded liver enlargement and bilateral ankle swelling  minor criteria are acceptable only if they can not be attributed to another medical condition such as pulmonary hypertension chronic lung disease cirrhosis ascites or the nephrotic syndrome  the framingham heart study criteria are 100 sensitive and 78 specific for identifying persons with definite congestive heart failure  the esc algorithm weights the following parameters in establishing the diagnosis of heart failure  there are several terms which are closely related to heart failure and may be the cause of heart failure but should not be confused with it cardiac arrest and asystole refer to situations in which there is no cardiac output at all without urgent treatment these result in sudden death myocardial infarction heart attack refers to heart muscle damage due to insufficient blood supply usually as a result of a blocked coronary artery cardiomyopathy refers specifically to problems within the heart muscle and these problems can result in heart failure ischemic cardiomyopathy implies that the cause of muscle damage is coronary artery disease dilated cardiomyopathy implies that the muscle damage has resulted in enlargement of the heart hypertrophic cardiomyopathy involves enlargement and thickening of the heart muscle a persons risk of developing heart failure is inversely related to their level of physical activity those who achieved at least 500 metminutesweek the recommended minimum by us guidelines had lower heart failure risk than individuals who did not report exercising during their free time the reduction in heart failure risk was even greater in those who engaged in higher levels of physical activity than the recommended minimum  treatment focuses on improving the symptoms and preventing the progression of the disease reversible causes of the heart failure also need to be addressed eg infection alcohol ingestion anemia thyrotoxicosis arrhythmia hypertension treatments include lifestyle and pharmacological modalities and occasionally various forms of device therapy and rarely cardiac transplantation in acute decompensated heart failure adhf the immediate goal is to reestablish adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to end organs this entails ensuring that airway breathing and circulation are adequate immediate treatments usually involve some combination of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin diuretics such as furosemide and possibly non invasive positive pressure ventilation nippv the goals of treatment for people with chronic heart failure are the prolongation of life the prevention of acute decompensation and the reduction of symptoms allowing for greater activity heart failure can result from a variety of conditions in considering therapeutic options it is important to first exclude reversible causes including thyroid disease anemia chronic tachycardia alcohol abuse hypertension and dysfunction of one or more heart valves treatment of the underlying cause is usually the first approach in treating heart failure however in the majority of cases either no primary cause is found or treatment of the primary cause does not restore normal heart function in these cases behavioral medical and device treatment strategies exist which can provide significant improvement in outcomes including the relief of symptoms exercise tolerance and a decrease in the likelihood of hospitalization or death behavioral modification is a primary consideration in any chronic heart failure management program with dietary guidelines regarding fluid and salt intake being of particular importance  exercise should be encouraged and tailored to suit individual capabilities the inclusion of regular physical conditioning as part of a cardiac rehabilitation program can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the risk of hospital admission for worsening symptoms however there is no evidence for a reduction in mortality rates as a result of exercise furthermore it is not clear whether this evidence can be extended to people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction hfpef or to those whose exercise regimen takes place entirely at home  home visits and regular monitoring at heart failure clinics reduce the need for hospitalization and improve life expectancy  firstline therapy for people with heart failure due to reduced systolic function should include angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors acei or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs if the person develops a long term cough as a side effect of the acei  use of medicines from this class are associated with improved survival and quality of life in people with heart failure  betaadrenergic blocking agents beta blockers also form part of the first line of treatment adding to the improvement in symptoms and mortality provided by aceiarb  the mortality benefits of beta blockers in people with systolic dysfunction who also have atrial fibrillation af is more limited than in those who do not have af  if the ejection fraction is not diminished hfpef the benefits of beta blockers is more modest a decrease in mortality has been observed but reduction in hospital admission for uncontrolled symptoms has not been observed  in people who are intolerant of acei and arbs or who have significant kidney dysfunction the use of combined hydralazine and a longacting nitrate such as isosorbide dinitrate are an effective alternative this regimen has been shown to reduce mortality in people with moderate heart failure  it is especially beneficial in africanamericans aa  in aas who are symptomatic hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate hi can be added to acei or arbs in people with markedly reduced ejection fraction the use of an aldosterone antagonist in addition to beta blockers and acei can improve symptoms and reduce mortality   secondline drugs for chf do not confer a mortality benefit digitalis is one such drug its narrow therapeutic window high degree of toxicity and the failure of multiple trials to show a mortality benefit have reduced its role in clinical practice it is now used in only a small number of people with refractory symptoms who are in atrial fibrillation andor who have chronic low blood pressure diuretics have been a mainstay of treatment for treatment of fluid accumulation and include diuretics classes such as loop diuretics thiazidelike diuretic and potassiumsparing diuretic although widely used evidence on their efficacy and safety is limited with the exception of spironolactone antagonists   a recent cochrane review found that in small studies the use of diuretics appeared to have improved mortality in individuals with heart failure  however the extent to which these results can be extrapolated to a general population is unclear due to the small number of participants in the cited studies  anemia is an independent factor in mortality in people with chronic heart failure the treatment of anemia significantly improves quality of life for those with heart failure often with a reduction in severity of the nyha classification and also improves mortality rates   the latest european guidelines 2012 recommend screening for irondeficient anemia and treating with parenteral iron if anemia is found  the decision to anticoagulate people with hf typically with left ventricular ejection fractions 35 is debated but generally people with coexisting atrial fibrillation a prior embolic event or conditions which increase the risk of an embolic event such as amyloidosis left ventricular noncompaction familial dilated cardiomyopathy or a thromboembolic event in a firstdegree relative  in people with severe cardiomyopathy left ventricular ejection fraction below 35 or in those with recurrent vt or malignant arrhythmias treatment with an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator aicd is indicated to reduce the risk of severe lifethreatening arrhythmias the aicd does not improve symptoms or reduce the incidence of malignant arrhythmias but does reduce mortality from those arrhythmias often in conjunction with antiarrhythmic medications in people with left ventricular ejection lvef below 35 the incidence of ventricular tachycardia vt or sudden cardiac death is high enough to warrant aicd placement its use is therefore recommended in ahaacc guidelines  cardiac contractility modulation ccm is a treatment for people with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic heart failure nyha class iiiv which enhances both the strength of ventricular contraction and the hearts pumping capacity the ccm mechanism is based on stimulation of the cardiac muscle by nonexcitatory electrical signals nes which are delivered by a pacemakerlike device ccm is particularly suitable for the treatment of heart failure with normal qrs complex duration 120 ms or less and has been demonstrated to improve the symptoms quality of life and exercise tolerance      ccm is approved for use in europe but not currently in north america   about one third of people with lvef below 35 have markedly altered conduction to the ventricles resulting in dyssynchronous depolarization of the right and left ventricles this is especially problematic in people with left bundle branch block blockage of one of the two primary conducting fiber bundles that originates at the base of the heart and carries depolarizing impulses to the left ventricle using a special pacing algorithm biventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy crt can initiate a normal sequence of ventricular depolarization in people with lvef below 35 and prolonged qrs duration on ecg lbbb or qrs of 150 ms or more there is an improvement in symptoms and mortality when crt is added to standard medical therapy  however in the two thirds of people without prolonged qrs duration crt may actually be harmful    people with the most severe heart failure may be candidates for ventricular assist devices vad vads have commonly been used as a bridge to heart transplantation but have been used more recently as a destination treatment for advanced heart failure  in select cases heart transplantation can be considered while this may resolve the problems associated with heart failure the person must generally remain on an immunosuppressive regimen to prevent rejection which has its own significant downsides  a major limitation of this treatment option is the scarcity of hearts available for transplantation people with chf often have significant symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain both palliative care and cardiology are trying to get palliative care involved earlier in the course of patients with heart failure and some would argue  any patient with nyha class iii chf should have a palliative care referral palliative care can not only provide symptom management but also assist with advanced care planning goals of care in the case of a significant decline and making sure the patient has a medical power of attorney and discussed his or her wishes with this individual  without transplantation heart failure may not be reversible and cardiac function typically deteriorates with time the growing number of patients with stage iv heart failure intractable symptoms of fatigue shortness of breath or chest pain at rest despite optimal medical therapy should be considered for palliative care or hospice according to american college of cardiologyamerican heart association guidelines  prognosis in heart failure can be assessed in multiple ways including clinical prediction rules and cardiopulmonary exercise testing clinical prediction rules use a composite of clinical factors such as lab tests and blood pressure to estimate prognosis among several clinical prediction rules for prognosing acute heart failure the effect rule slightly outperformed other rules in stratifying patients and identifying those at low risk of death during hospitalization or within 30 days  easy methods for identifying low risk patients are a very important method for assessing prognosis in advanced heart failure patients is cardiopulmonary exercise testing cpx testing cpx testing is usually required prior to heart transplantation as an indicator of prognosis cardiopulmonary exercise testing involves measurement of exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide during exercise the peak oxygen consumption vo2 max is used as an indicator of prognosis as a general rule a vo2 max less than 1214 cckgmin indicates a poor survival and suggests that the patient may be a candidate for a heart transplant patients with a vo2 max10 cckgmin have clearly poorer prognosis the most recent international society for heart and lung transplantation ishlt guidelines  also suggest two other parameters that can be used for evaluation of prognosis in advanced heart failure the heart failure survival score and the use of a criterion of vevco2 slope  35 from the cpx test the heart failure survival score is a score calculated using a combination of clinical predictors and the vo2 max from the cardiopulmonary exercise test heart failure is associated with significantly reduced physical and mental health resulting in a markedly decreased quality of life   with the exception of heart failure caused by reversible conditions the condition usually worsens with time although some people survive many years progressive disease is associated with an overall annual mortality rate of 10  approximately 18 of every 1000 persons will experience an ischemic stroke during the first year after diagnosis of hf as the duration of followup increases the stroke rate rises to nearly 50 strokes per 1000 cases of hf by 5 years  heart failure is associated with a high health expenditure mostly because of the cost of hospitalizations costs have been estimated to amount to 2 of the total budget of the national health service in the united kingdom and more than 35 billion in the united states   heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in people older than 65  in developed countries the mean age of patients with heart failure is 75 years old in developing countries two to three percent of the population have heart failure but in those 70 to 80 years old it occurs in 2030 percent more than 20 million people have heart failure worldwide   the prevalence and incidence of heart failure are increasing mostly because of increasing life span but also because of increased prevalence of risk factors hypertension diabetes dyslipidemia and obesity and improved survival rates from other types of cardiovascular disease myocardial infarction valvular disease and arrhythmias   in the united states heart failure affects 58 million people and each year 550000 new cases are diagnosed  in 2011 congestive heart failure was the most common reason for hospitalization for adults aged 85 years and older and the second most common for adults aged 6584 years  it is estimated that one in five adults at age 40 will develop heart failure during their remaining lifetime and about half of people who develop heart failure die within 5 years of diagnosis  heart failure is much higher in african americans hispanics native americans and recent immigrants from the eastern bloc countries like russia this high prevalence in these ethnic minority populations has been linked to high incidence of diabetes and hypertension in many new immigrants to the us the high prevalence of heart failure has largely been attributed to lack of preventive health care or substandard treatment  nearly one out of every four patients 247 hospitalized in the us with congestive heart failure are readmitted within 30 days  additionally more than 50 of patients seek readmission within 6 months after treatment and the average duration of hospital stay is 6 days in tropical countries the most common cause of hf is valvular heart disease or some type of cardiomyopathy as underdeveloped countries have become more affluent there has also been an increase in the incidence of diabetes hypertension and obesity which have in turn raised the incidence of heart failure  congestive heart failure is a leading cause of hospital readmissions in the us in a study of 18 states medicare patients aged 65 and older were readmitted at a rate of 245 per 100 admissions in 2011 in the same year medicaid patients were readmitted at a rate of 304 per 100 admissions and uninsured patients were readmitted at a rate of 168 per 100 admissions these are the highest readmission rates for both patient categories notably congestive heart failure was not among the top ten conditions with the most 30day readmissions among the privately insured  men have a higher incidence of heart failure but the overall prevalence rate is similar in both sexes since women survive longer after the onset of heart failure  women tend to be older when diagnosed with heart failure after menopause they are more likely than men to have diastolic dysfunction and seem to experience a lower overall quality of life than men after diagnosis  in 2011 nonhypertensive congestive heart failure was one of the ten most expensive conditions seen during inpatient hospitalizations in the us with aggregate inpatient hospital costs of more than 105 billion  there is lowquality evidence that stem cell therapy may help  although this evidence positively indicated benefit the evidence was of lower quality than other evidence that does not indicate benefit  a previous claim which came from a 2012 article published by the british journal heart stated that a low salt diet increased the risk of death in those with congestive heart failure this claim has since been withdrawn the paper was retracted by the journal in 2013 because two of the cited studies contained duplicate data that could not be verified and the data has since been lost

V coronary steal with its symptoms termed cardiac steal syndrome is a phenomenon where an alteration of circulation patterns lead to a reduction in the blood directed to the coronary circulation  it is caused when there is narrowing of the coronary arteries and a coronary vasodilator  is used  stealing blood away from those parts of the heart this happens as a result of the narrowed coronary arteries being always maximally dilated to compensate for the decreased upstream blood supply thus dilating the resistance vessels in the coronary circulation causes blood to be shunted away from the coronary vessels supplying the ischemic zones creating more ischemia   it is associated with dipyridamole hence dipyridamole is a pharmacological success but a therapeutic failure because of the coronary steal phenomenon  coronary steal is also the mechanism in most drugbased cardiac stress tests when a patient is incapable of doing physical activity they are given a vasodilator that produces a cardiac steal syndrome as a diagnostic procedure the test result is positive if the patients symptoms reappear or if ecg alterations are seen it is also associated with the administration of isoflurane which is an inhaled anesthetic hydralazine can potentially cause this condition as well as it is a direct arteriolar vasodilator it has been associated with nitroprusside  coronary arteriovenous fistula between coronary artery and another cardiac chamber like the coronary sinus right atrium or right ventricle may cause steal syndrome under conditions like myocardial infarction and possible angina or ventricular arrhythmias if the shunt is large in magnitude  it can also be associated with new patterns of blood vessel growth  it is sometimes treated by surgery

V a branchiostegal lung is a respiration organ used by some airbreathing arthropods it is one of the most significant adaptations of some crabs  and hermit crabs such as the coconut crab to their terrestrial habitats the branchiostegal gill tissue is supported by folds or other mechanisms to increase surface area and are of a similar tissue to that normally found in gills in this case the lung is more suited to the absorption of oxygen from air rather than water instead of branchiostegal lungs some terrestrial hermit crabs coenobita and birgus possess multiple gills and small lungs with other varieties of gas diffusion methods supporting the transition from aquatic to terrestrial dwelling the developmental shift from water diffusion gills to air perfusion lungs may have been related to the need for reduce rates of water loss in air

V nucleosynthesis the first nuclei were formed about three minutes after the big bang through the process called big bang nucleosynthesis it was then that hydrogen and helium formed to become the content of the first stars and this primeval process is responsible for the present hydrogenhelium ratio of the cosmos with the formation of stars heavier nuclei were created from hydrogen and helium by stellar nucleosynthesis a process that continues today some of these elements particularly those lighter than iron continue to be delivered to the interstellar medium when low mass stars eject their outer envelope before they collapse to form white dwarfs the remains of their ejected mass form the planetary nebulae observable throughout our galaxy supernova nucleosynthesis within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between magnesium atomic number 12 and nickel atomic number 28  supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel in the last few seconds of a type ii supernova event the synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy endothermic as they are created from the energy produced during the supernova explosion some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons the r process in the period of a few seconds during the explosion the elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest elements known such as the longlived elements uranium and thorium cosmic ray spallation caused when cosmic rays impact the interstellar medium and fragment larger atomic species is a significant source of the lighter nuclei particularly  he  be and  b that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis in addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of elements in the universe a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new nuclides on earth these nuclides contribute little to their abundances but may account for the presence of specific new nuclei these nuclides are produced via radiogenesis decay of longlived heavy primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium cosmic ray bombardment of elements on earth also contribute to the presence of rare shortlived atomic species called cosmogenic nuclides neurotransmitters there are many different ways to classify neurotransmitters dividing them into amino acids peptides and monoamines is sufficient for some classification purposes major neurotransmitters in addition over 50 neuroactive peptides have been found and new ones are discovered regularly many of these are coreleased along with a smallmolecule transmitter nevertheless in some cases a peptide is the primary transmitter at a synapse \u03b2endorphin is a relatively well known example of a peptide neurotransmitter because it engages in highly specific interactions with opioid receptors in the central nervous system single ions such as synaptically released zinc are also considered neurotransmitters by some  as well as some gaseous molecules such as nitric oxide no carbon monoxide co and hydrogen sulfide h2s  the gases are produced in the neural cytoplasm and are immediately diffused through the cell membrane into the extracellular fluid and into nearby cells to stimulate production of second messengers soluble gas neurotransmitters are difficult to study as they act rapidly and are immediately broken down existing for only a few seconds the most prevalent transmitter is glutamate which is excitatory at well over 90 of the synapses in the human brain  the next most prevalent is gammaaminobutyric acid or gaba which is inhibitory at more than 90 of the synapses that do not use glutamate although other transmitters are used in fewer synapses they may be very important functionally the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering the actions of some neurotransmitter systems often acting through transmitters other than glutamate or gaba addictive drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines exert their effects primarily on the dopamine system the addictive opiate drugs exert their effects primarily as functional analogs of opioid peptides which in turn regulate dopamine levels the human brain is the main organ of the human central nervous system it is located in the head protected by the skull it has the same general structure as the brains of other mammals but with a more developed cerebral cortex large animals such as whales and elephants have larger brains in absolute terms but when measured using a measure of relative brain size which compensates for body size the quotient for the human brain is almost twice as large as that of a bottlenose dolphin and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee though the quotient for a treeshrew brain is larger than that of a humans  much of the size of the human brain comes from the cerebral cortex especially the frontal lobes which are associated with executive functions such as selfcontrol planning reasoning and abstract thought the area of the cerebral cortex devoted to vision the visual cortex is also greatly enlarged in humans compared to other animals the human cerebral cortex is a thick layer of neural tissue that covers most of the brain this layer is folded in a way that increases the amount of surface area that can fit into the volume available the pattern of folds is similar across individuals but shows many small variations the cortex is divided into four lobes  the frontal lobe parietal lobe temporal lobe and occipital lobe some classification systems also include a limbic lobe and treat the insular cortex as a lobe within each lobe are numerous cortical areas each associated with a particular function including vision motor control and language the left and right sides of the cortex are broadly similar in shape and most cortical areas are replicated on both sides some areas though show strong lateralization particularly areas that are involved in language in most people the left hemisphere is dominant for language with the right hemisphere playing only a minor role there are other functions such as visualspatial ability for which the right hemisphere is usually dominant despite being protected by the thick bones of the skull suspended in cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from the bloodstream by the bloodbrain barrier the human brain is susceptible to damage and disease the most common forms of physical damage are closed head injuries such as a blow to the head a stroke or poisoning by a variety of chemicals which can act as neurotoxins such as ethanol alcohol infection of the brain though serious is rare because of the biological barriers which protect it the human brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders such as parkinsons disease and alzheimers disease mostly as the result of aging and multiple sclerosis a number of psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and clinical depression are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions although the nature of these is not well understood the brain can also be the site of brain tumors and these can be benign or malignant there are some techniques for studying the brain that are used in other animals that are just not suitable for use in humans and vice versa it is easier to obtain individual brain cells taken from other animals for study it is also possible to use invasive techniques in other animals such as inserting electrodes into the brain or disabling certains parts of the brain in order to examine the effects on behaviour  techniques that are not possible to be used in humans however only humans can respond to complex verbal instructions or be of use in the study of important brain functions such as language and other complex cognitive tasks but studies from humans and from other animals can be of mutual help medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and eeg recordings are important techniques in studying the brain the complete functional understanding of the human brain is an ongoing challenge for neuroscience the adult human brain weighs on average about 1315kg 2933lb or about 2 of total body weight   with a volume of around 1130 cubic centimetres cm  in women and 1260cm  in men although there is substantial individual variation  neurological differences between the sexes have not been shown to correlate in any simple way with iq or other measures of cognitive performance  the human brain is composed of neurons glial cells and blood vessels the number of neurons according to array tomography has been shown to be on average about 86 billion in the adult human brain with a roughly equal number about 84 billion of nonneuronal cells  out of these 16 billion or 19 of all brain neurons are located in the cerebral cortex including subcortical white matter 69 billion or 80 of all brain neurons are in the cerebellum and fewer than 1 of all brain neurons are located in the rest of the brain  the cerebral hemispheres the cerebrum form the largest part of the human brain and are situated above other brain structures they are covered with a cortical layer the cerebral cortex which has a convoluted topography  underneath the cerebrum lies the brainstem resembling a stalk on which the cerebrum is attached at the rear of the brain beneath the cerebrum and behind the brainstem is the cerebellum a structure with a horizontally furrowed surface the cerebellar cortex that makes it look different from any other brain area the same structures are present in other mammals although they vary considerably in relative size as a rule the smaller the cerebrum the less convoluted the cortex the cortex of a rat or mouse is almost perfectly smooth the cortex of a dolphin or whale on the other hand is more convoluted than the cortex of a human the living brain is very soft having a gellike consistency similar to soft tofu although referred to as grey matter the live cortex is pinkishbeige in color and slightly offwhite in the interior the human brain has many properties that are common to all vertebrate brains including a basic division into three parts called the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain with interconnected fluidfilled ventricles and a set of generic vertebrate brain structures including the medulla oblongata and pons of the brainstem the cerebellum optic tectum thalamus hypothalamus basal ganglia olfactory bulb and many others as a mammalian brain the human brain has special features that are common to all mammalian brains most notably a sixlayered cerebral cortex and a set of structures associated with it including the hippocampus and amygdala all vertebrates have a forebrain whose upper surface is covered with a layer of neural tissue called the pallium but in all except mammals the pallium has a relatively simple threelayered cell structure in mammals it has a much more complex sixlayered cell structure and is given a different name the cerebral cortex the hippocampus and amygdala also originate from the pallium but are much more complex in mammals than in other vertebrates as a primate brain the human brain has a much larger cerebral cortex in proportion to body size than most mammals and a very highly developed visual system the shape of the brain within the skull is also altered somewhat as a consequence of the upright position in which primates hold their heads as a hominid brain the human brain is substantially enlarged even in comparison to the brain of a typical monkey the sequence of evolution from australopithecus four million years ago to homo sapiens modern man was marked by a steady increase in brain size particularly in the frontal lobes which are associated with a variety of highlevel cognitive functions humans and other primates have some differences in gene sequence and genes are differentially expressed in many brain regions the functional differences between the human brain and the brains of other animals also arise from many geneenvironment interactions  the neuroimmune system of the brain is structurally distinct from the peripheral immune system which protects the rest of the body in particular the immune system is composed primarily of hematopoietic cells and anatomical barriers while the neuroimmune system is composed of glia mast cells and various brain barriers eg bloodbrain barrier and bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier the dominant feature of the human brain is corticalization the cerebral cortex in humans is so large that it overshadows every other part of the brain a few subcortical structures show alterations reflecting this trend the cerebellum for example has a medial zone connected mainly to subcortical motor areas and a lateral zone connected primarily to the cortex in humans the lateral zone takes up a much larger fraction of the cerebellum than in most other mammalian species corticalization is reflected in function as well as structure in a rat surgical removal of the entire cerebral cortex leaves an animal that is still capable of walking around and interacting with the environment  in a human comparable cerebral cortex damage produces a permanent state of coma the amount of association cortex relative to the other two categories of sensory and motor increases dramatically as one goes from simpler mammals such as the rat and the cat to more complex ones such as the chimpanzee and the human  a gene present in the human genome but not in the chimpanzee arhgap11b seems to play a major role in corticalization arhgap11b and human encephalisation the cerebral cortex is essentially a sheet of neural tissue folded in a way that allows a large surface area to fit within the confines of the skull when unfolded each cerebral hemisphere has a total surface area of about 13 square feet 012m   each cortical ridge is called a gyrus and each groove or fissure separating one gyrus from another is called a sulcus the cerebral cortex is nearly symmetrical with left and right hemispheres that are approximate mirror images of each other each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes the frontal lobe parietal lobe occipital lobe and temporal lobe with one exception this division into lobes does not derive from the structure of the cortex though the lobes are named after the bones of the skull that overlie them the frontal bone parietal bone temporal bone and occipital bone the borders between lobes lie beneath the sutures that link the skull bones together the exception is the border between the frontal and parietal lobes which lies behind the corresponding suture instead it follows the anatomical boundary of the central sulcus a deep fold in the brains structure where the primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex meet because of the arbitrary way most of the borders between lobes are demarcated they have little functional significance with the exception of the occipital lobe a small area that is entirely dedicated to vision each of the lobes contains a variety of brain areas that have minimal functional relationship the parietal lobe for example contains areas involved in somatosensation hearing language attention and spatial cognition in spite of this heterogeneity the division into lobes is convenient for reference the main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention abstract thinking behavior problem solving tasks and physical reactions and personality the occipital lobe is the smallest lobe its main functions are visual reception visualspatial processing movement and color recognition the temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories language and some hearing and speech although there are enough variations in the shape and placement of gyri and sulci cortical folds to make every brain unique most human brains show sufficiently consistent patterns of folding that allow them to be named many of the gyri and sulci are named according to the location on the lobes or other major folds on the cortex these include functions of the cortex are divided it into three categories of regions one consists of the primary sensory areas which receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus primary sensory areas include the visual area of the occipital lobe the auditory area in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe a second category is the primary motor cortex which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord this area occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe directly in front of the somatosensory area the third category consists of the remaining parts of the cortex which are called the association areas these areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex processes of perception thought and decisionmaking  different parts of the cerebral cortex are involved in different cognitive and behavioral functions the differences show up in a number of ways the effects of localized brain damage regional activity patterns exposed when the brain is examined using functional imaging techniques connectivity with subcortical areas and regional differences in the cellular architecture of the cortex neuroscientists describe most of the cortexthe part they call the neocortexas having six layers but not all layers are apparent in all areas and even when a layer is present its thickness and cellular organization may vary scientists have constructed maps of cortical areas on the basis of variations in the appearance of the layers as seen with a microscope one of the most widely used schemes came from korbinian brodmann who split the cortex into 51 different areas and assigned each a number many of these brodmann areas have since been subdivided for example brodmann area 1 is the primary somatosensory cortex brodmann area 17 is the primary visual cortex and brodmann area 25 is the anterior cingulate cortex  many of the brain areas brodmann defined have their own complex internal structures in a number of cases brain areas are organized into topographic maps where adjoining bits of the cortex correspond to adjoining parts of the body or of some more abstract entity a simple example of this type of correspondence is the primary motor cortex a strip of tissue running along the anterior edge of the central sulcus shown in the image to the right motor areas innervating each part of the body arise from a distinct zone with neighboring body parts represented by neighboring zones electrical stimulation of the cortex at any point causes a musclecontraction in the represented body part this somatotopic representation is not evenly distributed however the head for example is represented by a region about three times as large as the zone for the entire back and trunk the size of any zone correlates to the precision of motor control and sensory discrimination possible the areas for the lips fingers and tongue are particularly large considering the proportional size of their represented body parts in visual areas the maps are retinotopicthat is they reflect the topography of the retina the layer of lightactivated neurons lining the back of the eye in this case too the representation is uneven the foveathe area at the center of the visual fieldis greatly overrepresented compared to the periphery the visual circuitry in the human cerebral cortex contains several dozen distinct retinotopic maps each devoted to analyzing the visual input stream in a particular way the primary visual cortex brodmann area 17 which is the main recipient of direct input from the visual part of the thalamus contains many neurons that are most easily activated by edges with a particular orientation moving across a particular point in the visual field visual areas farther downstream extract features such as color motion and shape in auditory areas the primary map is tonotopic sounds are parsed according to frequency ie high pitch vs low pitch by subcortical auditory areas and this parsing is reflected by the primary auditory zone of the cortex as with the visual system there are a number of tonotopic cortical maps each devoted to analyzing sound in a particular way within a topographic map there can sometimes be finer levels of spatial structure in the primary visual cortex for example where the main organization is retinotopic and the main responses are to moving edges cells that respond to different edgeorientations are spatially segregated from one another during the first three weeks of gestation the human embryos ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate the neural plate then folds and closes to form the neural tube this tube flexes as it grows forming the crescentshaped cerebral hemispheres at the head and the cerebellum and pons towards the tail understanding the mindbody problem  the relationship between the brain and the mind  is a significant challenge both philosophically and scientifically this is because of the difficulty reconciling how mental activities such as thoughts and emotions can be implemented by physical structures such as neurons and synapses or by any other type of physical mechanism this difficulty was expressed by gottfried leibniz in an analogy known as leibnizs mill one is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles that is by figures and motions in imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think to sense and to have perception one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions so that one could enter into it just like into a windmill supposing this one should when visiting within it find only parts pushing one another and never anything by which to explain a perception doubt about the possibility of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove rené descartes and most of humankind along with him to dualism the belief that the mind exists independently of the brain  there has always however been a strong argument in the opposite direction there is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of or injuries to the brain for example by drugs or by lesions respectively can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways  for example a person suffering from alzheimers disease  a condition that causes physical damage to the brain  also experiences a compromised mind similarly someone who has taken a psychedelic drug may temporarily lose their sense of personal identity ego death or experience profound changes to their perception and thought processes likewise a patient with epilepsy who undergoes cortical stimulation mapping with electrical brain stimulation would also upon stimulation of his or her brain experience various complex feelings hallucinations memory flashbacks and other complex cognitive emotional or behavioral phenomena  following this line of thinking a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of or reducible to physical phenomena  each hemisphere of the brain interacts primarily with one half of the body but for reasons that are unclear the connections are crossed the left side of the brain interacts with the right side of the body and vice versa  motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain both cross the midline at the level of the brainstem visual input follows a more complex rule the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm and half of the fibers from each nerve split off to join the other the result is that connections from the left half of the retina in both eyes go to the left side of the brain whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain and vice versa thus the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body and visual input from the left side of the visual fieldan arrangement that presumably is helpful for visuomotor coordination the two cerebral hemispheres are connected by a very large nerve bundle the largest white matter structure in the brain called the corpus callosum which crosses the midline above the level of the thalamus  there are also two much smaller connections the anterior commissure and hippocampal commissure as well as many subcortical connections that cross the midline the corpus callosum is the main avenue of communication between the two hemispheres though it connects each point on the cortex to the mirrorimage point in the opposite hemisphere and also connects to functionally related points in different cortical areas in most respects the left and right sides of the brain are symmetrical in terms of function for example the counterpart of the lefthemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the righthemisphere area controlling the left hand there are however several very important exceptions involving language and spatial cognition in most people the left hemisphere is dominant for language a stroke that damages a key language area in the left hemisphere can leave the victim unable to speak or understand whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills a substantial part of current understanding of the interactions between the two hemispheres has come from the study of splitbrain patientspeople who underwent surgical transection of the corpus callosum in an attempt to reduce the severity of epileptic seizures these patients do not show unusual behavior that is immediately obvious but in some cases can behave almost like two different people in the same body with the right hand taking an action and then the left hand undoing it most of these patients when briefly shown a picture on the right side of the point of visual fixation are able to describe it verbally but when the picture is shown on the left are unable to describe it but may be able to give an indication with the left hand of the nature of the object shown the study of how language is represented processed and acquired by the brain is neurolinguistics which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics this field originated from the 19thcentury discovery that damage to different parts of the brain appeared to cause different symptoms physicians noticed that individuals with damage to a portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus now known as brocas area had difficulty in producing language aphasia of speech whereas those with damage to a region in the left superior temporal gyrus now known as wernickes area had difficulty in understanding it  since then there has been substantial debate over what linguistic processes these and other parts of the brain subserve  and although brocas and wernickes areas have traditionally been associated with language functions they may also be involved in certain nonspeech functions  there is also debate over whether or not there even is a strong onetoone relationship between brain regions and language functions that emerges during neocortical development  more recently research on language has increasingly used more modern methods including electrophysiology and functional neuroimaging to examine how language processing occurs iodine t4 and pufas stimulate the evolution of the nervous system in fact hypothyroidism in mammals causes cretinism and in adults a neurological regression as a general slowdown of nervous reflexes with lethargic cerebration metabolism digestion heart rate hypothermia   the brain consumes up to twenty percent of the energy used by the human body more than any other organ  brain metabolism normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source but during times of low glucose such as fasting exercise or limited carbohydrate intake the brain will use ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose the brain can also utilize lactate during exercise  longchain fatty acids cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier but the liver can break these down to produce ketones however the mediumchain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain    the brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle  although the human brain represents only 2 of the body weight it receives 15 of the cardiac output 20 of total body oxygen consumption and 25 of total body glucose utilization  the need to limit body weight has led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species such as bats who need to be able to fly  the brain mostly uses glucose for energy and deprivation of glucose as can happen in hypoglycemia can result in loss of consciousness the energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions this fact forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods pet and fmri  these are nuclear medicine imaging techniques which produce a threedimensional image of metabolic activity clinically death is defined as an absence of brain activity as measured by eeg injuries to the brain tend to affect large areas of the organ sometimes causing major deficits in intelligence memory personality and movement head trauma caused for example by vehicular or industrial accidents is a leading cause of death in youth and middle age in many cases more damage is caused by resultant edema than by the impact itself stroke caused by the blockage or rupturing of blood vessels in the brain is another major cause of death from brain damage other problems in the brain can be more accurately classified as diseases neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimers disease parkinsons disease huntingtons disease and motor neuron diseases are caused by the gradual death of individual neurons leading to diminution in movement control memory and cognition there are five motor neuron diseases the most common of which is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als some infectious diseases affecting the brain are caused by viruses and bacteria infection of the meninges the membranes that cover the brain can lead to meningitis bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as mad cow disease is deadly in cattle and humans and is linked to prions kuru is a similar prionborne degenerative brain disease affecting humans endemic only to papua new guinea tribes both are linked to the ingestion of neural tissue and may explain the tendency in human and some nonhuman species to avoid cannibalism viral or bacterial causes have been reported in multiple sclerosis and are established causes of encephalopathy and encephalomyelitis brain tumors both benign and malignant can form these can either originate in the cerebral tissue or in the meninges the most common are those growths that affect the glial cells known as gliomas this term has been extended to include all primary brain tumors  secondary cancers can form in the brain as a result of brain metastasis mental disorders such as clinical depression schizophrenia bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder may involve particular patterns of neuropsychological functioning related to various aspects of mental and somatic function these disorders may be treated by psychotherapy psychiatric medication social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals many brain disorders are congenital occurring during development taysachs disease fragile x syndrome and down syndrome are all linked to genetic and chromosomal errors many other syndromes such as the intrinsic circadian rhythm disorders are suspected to be congenital as well normal development of the brain can be altered by genetic factors drug use nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases during pregnancy epileptic and nonepileptic seizures can cause cognitive impairment when the seizures become widespread occur repeatedly in the same brain area or last for too long seizures can be assessed using eeg and various medical imaging techniques they can sometimes be treated using anticonvulsant drugs and certain neurosurgical procedures and auxiliary treatments may also be used a key source of information about the function of brain regions is the effects of damage to them  in humans strokes have long provided a natural laboratory for studying the effects of brain damage most strokes result from a blood clot lodging in the brain and blocking the local blood supply causing damage or destruction of nearby brain tissue the range of possible blockages is very wide leading to a great diversity of stroke symptoms analysis of strokes is limited by the fact that damage often crosses into multiple regions of the brain not along clearcut borders making it difficult to draw firm conclusions transient ischemic attacks tias are ministrokes that can cause sudden dimming or loss of vision including amaurosis fugax speech impairment ranging from slurring to dysarthria or aphasia and mental confusion but unlike a stroke the symptoms of a tia can resolve within a few minutes or 24 hours brain injury may still occur in a tia lasting only a few minutes   a silent stroke or silent cerebral infarct sci differs from a tia in that there are no immediately observable symptoms an sci may still cause long lasting neurological dysfunction affecting such areas as mood personality and cognition an sci often occurs before or after a tia or major stroke  by placing electrodes on the scalp it is possible to record the summed electrical activity of the cortex using a methodology known as electroencephalography eeg  eeg records average neuronal activity from the cerebral cortex and can detect changes in activity over large areas but with low sensitivity for subcortical activity eeg recordings are sensitive enough to detect tiny electrical impulses lasting only a few milliseconds most eeg devices have good temporal resolution but low spatial resolution electrodes can also be placed directly on the surface of the brain usually during surgical procedures that require removal of part of the skull this technique called electrocorticography ecog offers finer spatial resolution than electroencephalography but is very invasive in addition to measuring the electric field directly via electrodes placed over the skull it is possible to measure the magnetic field that the brain generates using a method known as magnetoencephalography meg  this technique also has good temporal resolution like eeg but with much better spatial resolution the greatest disadvantage of meg is that because the magnetic fields generated by neural activity are very subtle the neural activity must be relatively close to the surface of the brain to detect its magnetic field megs can only detect the magnetic signatures of neurons located in the depths of cortical folds sulci that have dendrites oriented in a way that produces a field neuroscientists along with researchers from allied disciplines study how the human brain works such research has expanded considerably in recent decades the decade of the brain an initiative of the united states government in the 1990s is considered to have marked much of this increase in research  it has been followed in 2013 by the brain initiative information about the structure and function of the human brain comes from a variety of experimental methods most information about the cellular components of the brain and how they work comes from studies of animal subjects using techniques described in the brain article some techniques however are used mainly in humans and therefore are described here there are several methods for detecting brain activity changes using threedimensional imaging of local changes in blood flow the older methods are spect and pet which depend on injection of radioactive tracers into the bloodstream a newer method functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri has considerably better spatial resolution and involves no radioactivity  using the most powerful magnets currently available fmri can localize brain activity changes to regions as small as one cubic millimeter the downside is that the temporal resolution is poor when brain activity increases the blood flow response is delayed by 15seconds and lasts for at least 10seconds thus fmri is a very useful tool for learning which brain regions are involved in a given behavior but gives little information about the temporal dynamics of their responses a major advantage for fmri is that because it is noninvasive it can readily be used on human subjects another new noninvasive functional imaging method is functional nearinfrared spectroscopy function of animal and human brain with treatment of its malfunctioning diseases are described with simple logic like computer working  in the course of evolution of the homininae the human brain has grown in volume from about 600 cm  in homo habilis to about 1500cm  in homo sapiens neanderthalensis subsequently there has been a shrinking over the past 28000 years the male brain has decreased from 1500cm  to 1350cm  while the female brain has shrunk by the same relative proportion  for comparison homo erectus a relative of humans had a brain size of 1100cm  however the little homo floresiensis with a brain size of 380cm  a third of that of their proposed ancestor h erectus used fire hunted and made stone tools at least as sophisticated as those of h erectus  in spite of significant changes in social capacity there has been very little change in brain size from neanderthals to the present day  the notion as large as you need and as small as you can has been used to summarize the opposite evolutionary constraints on human brain size   changes in the size of the human brain during evolution have been reflected in changes in the aspm and microcephalin genes  studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations averaging around 03 to 04 between brain volume and iq  the most consistent associations are observed within the frontal temporal and parietal lobes the hippocampi and the cerebellum but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in iq which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and realworld performance    one study indicated that in humans fertility and intelligence tend to be negatively correlatedthat is to say the more intelligent as measured by iq exhibit a lower total fertility rate than the less intelligent according to the model the present rate of decline is predicted to be 134 iq points per decade  biochemistry sometimes called biological chemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms  by controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life over the last decades of the 20th century biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine to genetics are engaged in biochemical research  today the main focus of pure biochemistry is on understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells  which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms  much of biochemistry deals with the structures functions and interactions of biological macromolecules such as proteins nucleic acids carbohydrates and lipids which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life  the chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions these can be inorganic for example water and metal ions or organic for example the amino acids which are used to synthesize proteins  the mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism the findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine nutrition and agriculture in medicine biochemists investigate the causes and cures of disease  in nutrition they study how to maintain health and study the effects of nutritional deficiencies  in agriculture biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers and try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation crop storage and pest control around two dozen of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements are essential to various kinds of biological life most rare elements on earth are not needed by life exceptions being selenium and iodine while a few common ones aluminum and titanium are not used most organisms share element needs but there are a few differences between plants and animals for example ocean algae use bromine but land plants and animals seem to need none all animals require sodium but some plants do not plants need boron and silicon but animals may not or may need ultrasmall amounts just six elementscarbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen calcium and phosphorusmake up almost 99 of the mass of a human body see composition of the human body for a complete list in addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body humans require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more  the four main classes of molecules in biochemistry often called biomolecules are carbohydrates lipids proteins and nucleic acids  many biological molecules are polymers in this terminology monomers are relatively small micromolecules that are linked together to create large macromolecules known as polymers when monomers are linked together to synthesize a biological polymer they undergo a process called dehydration synthesis different macromolecules can assemble in larger complexes often needed for biological activity the function of carbohydrates includes energy storage and providing structure sugars are carbohydrates but not all carbohydrates are sugars there are more carbohydrates on earth than any other known type of biomolecule they are used to store energy and genetic information as well as play important roles in cell to cell interactions and communications the simplest type of carbohydrate is a monosaccharide which between other properties contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen mostly in a ratio of 121 generalized formula cnh2non where n is at least 3 glucose c6h12o6 is one of the most important carbohydrates others include fructose c6h12o6 the sugar commonly associated with the sweet taste of fruits   and deoxyribose c5h10o4 a monosaccharide could switches from the acyclic openchain form to a cyclic form through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyls of the same molecule the reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom the resulting molecule has an hemiacetal or hemiketal group depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a ketose the reaction is easily reversed yielding the original openchain form  in these cyclic forms the ring usually has 5 or 6 atoms these forms are called furanoses and pyranoses respectively by analogy with furan and pyran the simplest compounds with the same carbonoxygen ring although they lack the double bonds of these two molecules for example the aldohexose glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4 yielding a molecule with a 5membered ring called glucofuranose the same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6membered ring called glucopyranose cyclic forms with a 7atom ring the same of oxepane rarely encountered are called heptoses when two monosaccharides undergo dehydration synthesis whereby a molecule of water is released as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are lost from the two monosaccharides the new molecule consisting of two monosaccharides is called a disaccharide and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or ether bond the reverse reaction can also occur using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond this is termed hydrolysis the most wellknown disaccharide is sucrose ordinary sugar in scientific contexts called table sugar or cane sugar to differentiate it from other sugars sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together another important disaccharide is lactose consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule as most humans age the production of lactase the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and galactose typically decreases this results in lactase deficiency also called lactose intolerance when a few around three to six monosaccharides are joined it is called an oligosaccharide oligo meaning few these molecules tend to be used as markers and signals as well as having some other uses  many monosaccharides joined together make a polysaccharide they can be joined together in one long linear chain or they may be branched two of the most common polysaccharides are cellulose and glycogen both consisting of repeating glucose monomers examples are cellulose which is an important structural component of plants cell walls and glycogen used as a form of energy storage in animals sugar can be characterized by having reducing or nonreducing ends a reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the openchain aldehyde aldose or keto form ketose if the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an ohsidechain of another sugar yielding a full acetal this prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue nonreducing lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety whereas the galactose moiety form a full acetal with the c4oh group of glucose saccharose does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose c1 and the keto carbon of fructose c2 lipids comprises a diverse range of molecules and to some extent is a catchall for relatively waterinsoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin including waxes fatty acids fattyacid derived phospholipids sphingolipids glycolipids and terpenoids eg retinoids and steroids some lipids are linear aliphatic molecules while others have ring structures some are aromatic while others are not some are flexible while others are rigid  lipids are usually made from one molecule of glycerol combined with other molecules in triglycerides the main group of bulk lipids there is one molecule of glycerol and three fatty acids fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case and may be saturated no double bonds in the carbon chain or unsaturated one or more double bonds in the carbon chain  most lipids have some polar character in addition to being largely nonpolar in general the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or hydrophobic waterfearing meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water another part of their structure is polar or hydrophilic waterloving and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water this makes them amphiphilic molecules having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions in the case of cholesterol the polar group is a mere oh hydroxyl or alcohol in the case of phospholipids the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar as described below  lipids are an integral part of our daily diet most oils and milk products that we use for cooking and eating like butter cheese ghee etc are composed of fats vegetable oils are rich in various polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa lipidcontaining foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids lipids especially phospholipids are also used in various pharmaceutical products either as cosolubilisers eg in parenteral infusions or else as drug carrier components eg in a liposome or transfersome proteins are very large molecules  macrobiopolymers  made from monomers called amino acids an amino acid consists of a carbon atom bound to four groups one is an amino group nh2 and one is a carboxylic acid group cooh although these exist as nh3  and coo  under physiologic conditions the third is a simple hydrogen atom the fourth is commonly denoted r and is different for each amino acid there are 20 standard amino acids each containing a carboxyl group an amino group and a sidechain known as an r group the r group is what makes each amino acid different and the properties of the sidechains greatly influence the overall threedimensional conformation of a protein some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form for instance glutamate functions as an important neurotransmitter amino acids can be joined via a peptide bond in this dehydration synthesis a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acids amino group to the carbon of the others carboxylic acid group the resulting molecule is called a dipeptide and short stretches of amino acids usually fewer than thirty are called peptides or polypeptides longer stretches merit the title proteins as an example the important blood serum protein albumin contains 585 amino acid residues  some proteins perform largely structural roles for instance movements of the proteins actin and myosin ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle one property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of moleculesthey may be extremely selective in what they bind antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule in fact the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa which uses antibodies is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules probably the most important proteins however are the enzymes these molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called substrates they then catalyze the reaction between them by lowering the activation energy the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10  or more a reaction that would normally take over 3000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme the enzyme itself is not used up in the process and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates using various modifiers the activity of the enzyme can be regulated enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole the structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels the primary structure of a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids for instance alanineglycinetryptophanserineglutamateasparagineglycinelysine secondary structure is concerned with local morphology morphology being the study of structure some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an \u03b1helix or into a sheet called a \u03b2sheet some \u03b1helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above tertiary structure is the entire threedimensional shape of the protein this shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids in fact a single change can change the entire structure the alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues substitution of the glutamate residue at position 6 with a valine residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in sicklecell disease finally quaternary structure is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits like hemoglobin with its four subunits not all proteins have more than one subunit  ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the small intestine and then absorbed they can then be joined to make new proteins intermediate products of glycolysis the citric acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway can be used to make all twenty amino acids and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them humans and other mammals however can synthesize only half of them they cannot synthesize isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine tryptophan and valine these are the essential amino acids since it is essential to ingest them mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine asparagine aspartate cysteine glutamate glutamine glycine proline serine and tyrosine the nonessential amino acids while they can synthesize arginine and histidine they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young growing animals and so these are often considered essential amino acids if the amino group is removed from an amino acid it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an \u03b1keto acid enzymes called transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid making it an \u03b1keto acid to another \u03b1keto acid making it an amino acid this is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids as for many of the pathways intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the \u03b1keto acid skeleton and then an amino group is added often via transamination the amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein  a similar process is used to break down proteins it is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids free ammonia nh3 existing as the ammonium ion nh4  in blood is toxic to life forms a suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist different tactics have evolved in different animals depending on the animals needs unicellular organisms of course simply release the ammonia into the environment likewise bony fish can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted in general mammals convert the ammonia into urea via the urea cycle  in order to determine whether two proteins are related or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not scientists use sequencecomparison methods methods like sequence alignments and structural alignments are powerful tools that help scientists identify homologies between related molecules  the relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of protein families by finding how similar two protein sequences are we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function nucleic acids so called because of its prevalence in cellular nuclei is the generic name of the family of biopolymers they are complex highmolecularweight biochemical macromolecules that can convey genetic information in all living cells and viruses  the monomers are called nucleotides and each consists of three components a nitrogenous heterocyclic base either a purine or a pyrimidine a pentose sugar and a phosphate group  the most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid dna and ribonucleic acid rna  the phosphate group and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information the most common nitrogenous bases are adenine cytosine guanine thymine and uracil the nitrogenous bases of each strand of a nucleic acid will form hydrogen bonds with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid similar to a zipper adenine binds with thymine and uracil thymine binds only with adenine and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another aside from the genetic material of the cell nucleic acids often play a role as second messengers as well as forming the base molecule for adenosine triphosphate atp the primary energycarrier molecule found in all living organisms  also the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different adenine cytosine and guanine occur in both rna and dna while thymine occurs only in dna and uracil occurs in rna glucose is the major energy source in most life forms for instance polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers glycogen phosphorylase removes glucose residues from glycogen disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important tenstep pathway called glycolysis the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate this also produces a net two molecules of atp the energy currency of cells along with two reducing equivalents of converting nad  to nadh this does not require oxygen if no oxygen is available or the cell cannot use oxygen the nad is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate lactic acid eg in humans or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide eg in yeast other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway  in aerobic cells with sufficient oxygen as in most human cells the pyruvate is further metabolized it is irreversibly converted to acetylcoa giving off one carbon atom as the waste product carbon dioxide generating another reducing equivalent as nadh the two molecules acetylcoa from one molecule of glucose then enter the citric acid cycle producing two more molecules of atp six more nadh molecules and two reduced ubiquinones via fadh2 as enzymebound cofactor and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide the produced nadh and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes thus oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors nad  and quinone are regenerated this is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide the energy released from transferring the electrons from highenergy states in nadh and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to atp via atp synthase this generates an additional 28 molecules of atp 24 from the 8 nadh  4 from the 2 quinols totaling to 32 molecules of atp conserved per degraded glucose two from glycolysis  two from the citrate cycle  it is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygenindependent metabolic feature and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after earths atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen in vertebrates vigorously contracting skeletal muscles during weightlifting or sprinting for example do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand and so they shift to anaerobic metabolism converting glucose to lactate the liver regenerates the glucose using a process called gluconeogenesis this process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis six molecules of atp are used compared to the two gained in glycolysis analogous to the above reactions the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy be stored as glycogen or starch in plants or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di or oligosaccharides the combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise lactates crossing via the bloodstream to the liver subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the cori cycle  researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of genetics molecular biology and biophysics there has never been a hardline among these disciplines in terms of content and technique today the terms molecular biology and biochemistry are nearly interchangeable the following figure is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields a   fructose is not the only sugar found in fruits glucose and sucrose are also found in varying quantities in various fruits and indeed sometimes exceed the fructose present for example 32 of the edible portion of date is glucose compared with 2370 fructose and 820 sucrose however peaches contain more sucrose 666 than they do fructose 093 or glucose 147    the actinide \u02c8ækt\u1d7bna\u026ad or actinoid \u02c8ækt\u1d7bn\u0254\u026ad iupac nomenclature series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103 actinium through lawrencium     the actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series actinium the informal chemical symbol an is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide all but one of the actinides are fblock elements corresponding to the filling of the 5f electron shell lawrencium a dblock element is also generally considered an actinide in comparison with the lanthanides also mostly fblock elements the actinides show much more variable valence they all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties while actinium and the late actinides from americium onwards behave similarly to the lanthanides the elements thorium through neptunium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry all actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay naturally occurring uranium and thorium and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on earth these are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors of the actinides primordial thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial quantities and small amounts of persisting natural plutonium have also been identified the radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium and protactinium and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation reactions in uranium ores the other actinides are purely synthetic elements   nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment analysis of debris from a 1952

metals are a group column in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium li sodium na potassium k  rubidium rb caesium cs  and francium fr this group lies in the sblock of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an sorbital this elementelectron configuration results in their characteristic properties the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting wellcharacterized homologous behaviour the alkali metals have very similar properties they are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge 1 they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free element in the modern iupac nomenclature the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements  excluding hydrogen h which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature in order of abundance sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity and thus occurs only in traces due to its presence in natural decay chains experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium uue which is likely to be the next member of the group but they have all met with failure however ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues most alkali metals have many different applications two of the most wellknown applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium atomic clocks of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time a common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodiumvapour lamp which emits very efficient light table salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity sodium and potassium are also essential elements having major biological roles as electrolytes and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful the alkaline earth metals are six chemical elements in column group 2 of the periodic table they are beryllium be magnesium mg calcium ca strontium sr barium ba and radium ra  they have very similar properties they are all shiny silverywhite somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure  structurally they have in common an outer s electron shell which is full    that is this orbital contains its full complement of two electrons which these elements readily lose to form cations with charge 2 and an oxidation state oxidation number of 2  all the discovered alkaline earth metals occur in nature  experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of element 120 the next potential member of the group but they have all met with failure the lanthanide \u02c8læn\u03b8\u0259na\u026ad or lanthanoid \u02c8læn\u03b8\u0259n\u0254\u026ad series of chemical elements  comprises the fifteen metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers 57 through 71 from lanthanum through lutetium    these fifteen lanthanide elements along with the chemically similar elements scandium and yttrium are often collectively known as the rare earth elements the informal chemical symbol ln is used in general discussions of lanthanide chemistry to refer to any lanthanide all but one of the lanthanides are fblock elements corresponding to the filling of the 4f electron shell lutetium a dblock element is also generally considered to be a lanthanide due to its chemical similarities with the other fourteen all lanthanide elements form trivalent cations ln  whose chemistry is largely determined by the ionic radius which decreases steadily from lanthanum to lutetium they are termed as lanthanides because the lighter elements in the series are chemically similar to lanthanum strictly speaking both lanthanum and lutetium have been labeled as group 3 elements because they both have a single valence electron in the d shell however both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements in presentations of the periodic table the lanthanides and the actinides are

V the seven countries study is an epidemiological longitudinal study directed by ancel keys at what is today the university of minnesota laboratory of physiological hygiene  exercise science lphes begun in 1956 with a yearly grant of us200000 from the us public health service the study was first published in 1970 and then followed up on its subjects every five years thereafter  as the worlds first  multicountry epidemiological study it systematically examined the relationships between lifestyle diet coronary heart disease and stroke in different populations from different regions of the world it directed attention to the causes of coronary heart disease and stroke but also showed that an individuals risk can be changed as of 2015 heated scientific debate continues project officer henry blackburn wrote in 1975 two strikingly polar attitudes persist on this subject with much talk from each and little listening between  describing online comments on his review of a book about the atkins diet t colin campbell wrote in 2014 that an irrationalityinfuses both sides of this debate better characterized as a shouting match    in the 1940s a university of minnesota researcher ancel keys postulated that the apparent epidemic of heart attacks in middleaged american men was related to their mode of life and possibly modifiable physical characteristics he first explored this idea in a group of minnesota business and professional men executives aged 45 to 55 that he recruited into a prospective study in 1947 the first of many cohort studies eventually mounted internationally the us public health service agreed to fund the study and then set up and proceeded to fund the framingham heart study on a larger scale the minnesota men were followed through 1981 and the first major report appeared in 1963 after the fifteenyear followup study   the study contributed much to survey methods and confirmed the results of larger studies that reported earlier on the predictive value for heart attack of several characteristics measured in health the nowtraditional risk factors of blood pressure and blood cholesterol level and cigarette smoking keys traveled widely with his wife margaret who tested peoples serum cholesterol they sent their samples back to minnesota for analysis in 1952 keyss hypothesis that coronary heart disease could be related to diet was first published in voeding in the netherlands  keyss work in postwartime naples led him to seek organization and funding for studies of different populations as did his subsequent work in uganda cape town south africa sardinia bologna and ilomantsi finland and with japanese men living in hawaii and in japan he decided to concentrate on men living in villages rather than those in cities where the population moved around frequently  in the mid1950s with improved methods and design keys recruited collaborating researchers in seven countries to mount the first crosscultural comparison of heart attack risk in populations of men engaged in traditional occupations in cultures contrasting in diet especially in the proportion of fat calories of different composition the seven countries study still under observation today the seven countries study was formally started in fall 1958 in yugoslavia in total 12763 males 4059 years of age were enrolled as 16 cohorts in seven countries in four regions of the world united states northern europe southern europe japan one cohort is in the united states two cohorts in finland one in the netherlands three in italy five in yugoslavia two in croatia and three in serbia two in greece and two in japan the entry examinations were performed between 1958 and 1964 with an average participation rate of 90 lowest in the usa with 75 and highest in one of the japanese cohorts with 100  the seven countries study has continued for more than 50 years the seven countries study showed that the risk and rates of heart attack and stroke cardiovascular risk both at the population level and at the individual level was directly and independently related to the level of total serum cholesterol it demonstrated that the association between blood cholesterol level and coronary heart disease chd risk from 5 to 40 years followup is found consistently across different cultures cholesterol and obesity were associated with increased mortality from cancer    objective data on cvd health in relation to the mediterranean diet originated from the seven countries study coronary deaths in the united states and northern europe greatly exceeded those in southern europe even when controlled for age cholesterol blood pressure smoking physical activity and weight when investigated further the importance of the eating pattern characterized as the mediterranean diet became clear      what exactly is meant by mediterranean diet today and its benefits was detailed by antonia trichopoulou and anna ferroluzzi the diet was publicized and popularized by greg drescher of the oldways preservation and exchange trust and by walter willett of the harvard school of public health       the seven countries study also showed that the slowly changing habits of a population in the mediterranean region from a healthy active lifestyle and diet to a less active lifestyle and a diet influenced by the western pattern diet significantly increases risk of heart disease   meanwhile it has been confirmed by other researchers that there is an inverse association between adherence to the mediterranean diet and the incidence of fatal and non fatal heart disease in initially healthy middleaged adults in the mediterranean region  the seven countries study along with other important large studies eg the framingham heart study nurses health study womens health initiative confirmed not only the importance of healthy diet but also of not being overweight or obese and of regular exercise in maintaining good general health it also showed that regular exercise and dietary fibre strongly influence body fat levels  these and other research findings made it possible to calculate the probability of an individual developing coronary heart disease in the future     the seven countries study demonstrated that elevated blood pressure hypertension increases risk of coronary heart disease and stroke it showed that the mortality rate after a coronary heart disease event or stroke can be influenced by the level of hypertension in several cohorts of the study stroke deaths exceeded deaths from coronary heart disease   the seven countries study showed that differences in overall mortality between the different regions of the world are largely accounted for by the variation in cardiovascular mortality  the seven countries study confirmed that cigarette smoking is a highly significant predictor of the development of coronary heart disease leading to excess rates of angina pectoris myocardial infarction mi and coronary death along with other important studies about smoking eg the framingham heart study and the british doctors study     the seven countries study revealed the importance of good cardiovascular health in avoiding dementia in the general population it also showed that cardiovascular risk factors in mid life are significantly associated with increased risk of dementia death later in life  scientists differed on the best predictors of heart disease in the history according to gary taubes in 1950 in science john gofman described separating lipoproteins into different densities in the university of california berkeley ultracentrifuge  in 1952 as part of a panel with keys gofman agreed that reducing fat in the diet might help some heart patients  and in this same issue of circulation keys explained that dietary cholesterol is not a factor in humans  in 1956 gofman wrote that an atherogenic index the combined levels of ldl and vldl predicted atherosclerosis and heart disease  in 1958 he wrote the serum cholesterol measurement can be a dangerously misleading guide in evaluation of the effect of diet upon the serum lipids  some offered hypotheses opposed to keys in 1966 based on their work and writing since 1956 george campbell and thomas l cleave published diabetes coronary thrombosis and the saccharine disease they argued that the chronic western diseases such as diabetes heart disease obesity peptic ulcers and appendicitis are caused by one thing refined carbohydrate disease  in 1957 a distinguished pioneer in lipid research edward h pete ahrens jr warned of oversimplifying the problem of diet and heart disease saying the cause could be fat and cholesterol or it could be carbohydrates and triglycerides until evidence was produced he questioned the wisdom of prescribing lowfat diets for the general population  even before the study had begun there had been criticism of its methods jacob yerushalmy and herman e hilleboe pointed out that for an earlier study demonstrating this association keys had selected six countries out of 21 for which data were available analysis of the full dataset made the analysis between fat intake and heart disease less clear  in 1957 when they published their critique  yerushalmy and hilleboe seemed to some to be lecturing the association between the percentage of fat calories and mortality from heart disease is not valid and then they call keyss work a tenuous association  keys who was one of the first nutrition epidemiologists wrote in every journal article that causal relationships are not claimed his reaction was to mount the seven countries study the first multicountry epidemiological study ever done  several scientists stepped forward at the time to disagree with keyss conclusions published in 1973 and including his critique of keyss work  raymond reiser found methodological and interpretational errors in a review of forty trials  ahrens found separately with margaret albrink that triglycerides mattered in coronary disease more than total cholesterol and came to think that carbohydrates cause heart disease and not fats  although he is widely misquoted to this day for example in breitbart  george v mann did not say in the new england journal of medicine nejm in 1977 that the lipid theory is the greatest scam in the history of medicine   mann studied the mainly meat diet of alaskan eskimos congolese pygmies and the maasai of tanzania and kenya and thought other factors like lack of exercise were responsible for heart disease  in nejm in 1977 he dismissed keyss work of 1953 the naïveté is now a classroom demonstration  john yudkin thought that sugar not fat was at the root of heart disease and other human ills keys wrote and promoted his disagreement in 1971  the next year yudkin retired to write pure white and deadly  in 2000 uffe ravnskov published his book the cholesterol myths and went on to found the international network of cholesterol skeptics  in his 2009 video sugar the bitter truth robert lustig says his purpose is to debunk the prior thirty years of nutrition research specifically keys  lustig gave details in his book fat chance that keys cherrypicked seven of 22 countries consumption of transfat peaked in the 1960s and keys failed to separate them out results for japan and italy could be explained by either low saturated fat consumption or by low sugar consumption and keys wrote that sucrose and saturated fat were intercorrelated but failed to perform the sucrose half of his multivariate correlation analysis  controversy continues about the study itself and about the strength and causality of the association between dietary fat and heart mortality particularly as the study of cholesterol has become more sophisticated   reigniting the debate  was a metaanalysis in 2014 finding that current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats  however this metastudy has also met with controversy and was corrected with willett continuing to defend reduced saturated fat in the diet  james j dinicolantonio one of the associate editors of bmjs open heart authored or coauthored a number of papers in 2014 with scientists who believe a diet including saturated fat does no harm to human hearts    lustig yudkin and dinicolantonio mention keys by name    and most mention the seven countries study as do recent books by two journalists gary taubes and nina teicholz taubes wrote two bestsellers good calories bad calories in 2007  followed by why we get fat in 20102011  part i of good calories bad calories relates how we came to believe dietary fat causes heart disease part ii offers that carbohydrates cause the chronic diseases of civilization and part iii explains obesity and calories  adding interviews teicholzs the big fat surprise closely follows taubes part i urging a second look at the idea that saturated fat causes heart disease taubes became a regular contributor to the new york times opinion pages  and twice the paper gave taubes a lead feature story in its sunday magazine what if its all been a big fat lie 2002  and is sugar toxic 2011  campbell who mentions the seven countries study and recounts meeting keys twice  calls taubes by far the most eloquent and influential presentday spokesperson for the lowcarb movement  in his book the lowcarb fraud 2014 campbell says that taubes was right to demolish the counting calories myth and that his history of the past five decades of nutrition science is well done although later termed a distortion   an advocate for a whole food plantbased wfpb diet campbell points out that taubes uses a bit of sleight of hand to say that refined sugar is bad therefore all foods that contain sugars ie carbs are bad  in september 2014 frank hu led the 2015 dietary guidelines advisory committees report on saturated fat and cardiovascular disease alice h lichtenstein said that the consensus is that a lowfat diet is probably not a good idea and that it might induce dyslipidemia she said that the guidelines had changed formerly recommending low fat and now moderate fat in 2000 and that the american heart association and the national heart lung and blood institute had revised guidelines as of 2000  the groups scientific report of the 2015 dietary guidelines advisory committee says the average person in the us consumes too much saturated fat sources of saturated fat should be replaced with unsaturated fat particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids  as of mid2015 webmd and the mayo clinic both recommended that its readers avoid or minimize saturated fats and replace them with polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats

V reissners fiber is a fibrous aggregation of secreted molecules extending from the subcommissural organ sco through the ventricular system and central canal to the ampulla caudalis a small ventriclelike structure at the end of the spinal cord  in vertebrates reissners fiber is formed by secretions of scospondin from the subcommissural organ into the spinal fluid of the ventricular cavity  reissners fiber is highly conserved and present in the central canal of all chordates  in cephalochordates reissners fiber is produced by the ventral infundibular organ as opposed to the dorsal sco    reissners fiber rf is a complex and dynamic structure present in the third and fourth ventricles and in the central canal of the spinal cord observed in almost all vertebrates except in humans and anthropoid apes   it is formed by the assembly of complex and variable high weight molecular glycoproteins secreted by the sco that are released to the cerebrospinal fluid at least five different proteins were found of 630 kda 480 kda 390 kda 320 kda and the major constituent 200kda that is present in both rf and cerebrospinal fluid csf one of the most important rfglycoproteins secreted by the sco has been named scospondin and is of major importance especially during embryonic life   reissners fiber grows caudally by the addition of those glycoproteins at its cephalic end and extends along the brain aqueduct aqueduct of sylvius and the entire length of the central canal of the spinal cord growing continuously in the caudal direction it is just a small part of the secretions made by sco and remains a matter of speculation probably involved in many physiological functions as clearance of monoamines detoxification of the csf neuronal surviving or the control of water balance    the glycoproteins forming rf can be found in three conformations the first on is when the material aggregates over the sco cilia the socalled prerf the second and most studied form known as the proper rf which is a cylindrical regular structure and finally a third and final form massa caudalis known as the final distribution and the final assembly of the proteins  this fiber is essentially made by glycoproteins secreted by the subcommissural organ of high molecular mass that are released into the cerebrospinal fluid here they aggregate on the top of the cilia forming a thin film that becomes further packed in a highly ordered fashion to form threadlike supramolecular structure  the prerf material appears in the form of loosely arranged bundles of thin filaments after this it is plausible that some biochemical modifications may occur to the prerf material in order for it to condensate and form the exact reissners fiber such as disassembly and passage into neighboring vessels some of these changes may decrease the reactivity of the molecules and this should be considered as a transitory stage from pre to the proper rf in which the accessibility of the antibodies to the epitopes is decreased this lack of immunoreactivity could be due to the spatial distribution of sialic acid residues with negative charge within the fiber or might be the result of bound compounds interfering with the accessibility of the antibodies to rf glycoproteins  the massa caudalis is the final form of this assembly of proteins and is mostly related with the distal side of accumulation of the fiber and this final form have more filaments and is less compact than the middle form of the fiber  the secretory material is first synthesised at embryonic day3 e3 by morphological undifferentiated neuroepithelial cells at e7 post coitum the scospondin it is released to embryonic csf ecsf however rf does not form until e11 and only at e12 the rf is present in the lumbar spinal cord the mechanisms that trigger rf formation remain unknown but probably factors other that ventricular released must be required for the formation of the fiber like the hydrodynamics of the csf  this complex may participate in the maintenance of water and electrolyte homeostasis osmoregulation during ontogeny and in the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid   the scorf has been linked to various and different aspects of water and electrolyte metabolism and it is proven that water deprivation enhances the secretory activity of the sco this helps prove the correction between this complex and the adrenal cortex and it has been reported the presence in the scorf of receptors or binding sites for peptides involved in hydromineral balance such as angiotensin ii this complex is involved in many physiological functions like development of spinal cord the pathophysiology of lordosis or the neuronal survival in a more developmental pathway   reissners fiber because of the sialic acid residues with negative charge might participate in the cleaning of the csf the glycoproteins bind biogenic amines present in the csf like dopamine serotonin or noradrenaline controlling this way the concentration of these monoamines by ionic change there are however differences in the biding characteristics of each of these amines the binding of serotonin is more unstable and it occurs only when its csf concentration is high but on the other hand noradrenaline binds strongly to the rf and remains bound as it moves along the central canal in the same binding site of adrenaline   the concentration of these monoamines in the csf in reissners fiber deprived animals was investigated and it was possible to conclude that this fiber is involved in the cleaning of the liquid because those animals display as increased in the csf concentration of several amines being ldopa the one with the highest rise all findings obtained indicate that rf binds monoamines present in the ventricular csf and then transports them along the central canal in the absence of rf the csf concentration of monoamines increased sharply

small intestine has three distinct regions  the duodenum jejunum and ileum the duodenum receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct controlled by the sphincter of oddi the primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals from food  this article is primarily about the human gastrointestinal tract the information about its processes is directly applicable to most placental mammals a major exception to this is the digestive process in ruminants  notably cows in invertebrates such as worms the term large intestine is often used to describe the entire gastrointestinal tract   the average length of the small intestine in an adult human male is 69m 22ft 8in and 71m 23ft 4in in an adult female it can vary greatly from as short as 46m 15ft to as long as 98m 32ft   recent studies indicate that small intestine may be shorter around 35m 11ft 6in and that the length is less affected by age after childhood than expected  it is approximately 253cm in diameter the surface area of the human small intestinal mucosa averages 30 square meters   the small intestine is divided into three structural parts the duodenum is a short structure about 2025cm long continuous with the stomach and shaped like a c  it surrounds the head of the pancreas it receives gastric chyme from the stomach together with digestive juices from the pancreas digestive enzymes and the gall bladder bile the digestive enzymes break down proteins and bile and emulsify fats into micelles the duodenum contains brunners glands which produce a mucusrich alkaline secretion containing bicarbonate these secretions in combination with bicarbonate from the pancreas neutralizes the stomach acids contained in gastric chyme the jejunum is the midsection of the small intestine connecting the duodenum to the ileum it is about 25 m long and contains the plicae circulares and villi that increase its surface area products of digestion sugars amino acids and fatty acids are absorbed into the bloodstream here the suspensory muscle of duodenum marks the division between the duodenum and the jejunum the ileum the final section of the small intestine it is about 3 m long and contains villi similar to the jejunum it absorbs mainly vitamin b12 and bile acids as well as any other remaining nutrients the ileum joins to the cecum of the large intestine at the ileocecal junction the jejunum and ileum are suspended in the abdominal cavity by mesentery the mesentery is part of the peritoneum arteries veins lymph vessels and nerves travel within the mesentery  the small intestine receives a blood supply from the coeliac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery these are both branches of the aorta the duodenum receives blood from the coeliac trunk via the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and from the superior mesenteric artery visa the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery these two arteries both have anterior and posterior branches that meet in the midline and anastaomose the jejunum and ileum receive blood from the superior mesenteric artery  branches of the superior mesenteric artery form a series of arches within the mesentery known as arterial arcades which may be several layers deep straight blood vessels known as vasa recta travel from the arcades closest to the ileum and jejunum to the organs themselves  the three sections of the small intestine look similar to each other at a microscopic level but there are some important differences the parts of the intestine are as follows the small intestine develops from the midgut of the primitive gut tube  by the fifth week of embryological life the ileum begins to grow longer at a very fast rate forming a ushaped fold called the primary intestinal loop the loop grows so fast in length that it outgrows the abdomen and protrudes through the umbilicus by week 10 the loop retracts back into the abdomen between weeks six and ten the small intestine rotates anticlockwise as viewed from the front of the embryo it rotates a further 180 degrees after it has moved back into the abdomen this process creates the twisted shape of the large intestine  food from the stomach is allowed into the duodenum through the pylorus by a muscle called the pyloric sphincter the small intestine is where most chemical digestion takes place many of the digestive enzymes that act in the small intestine are secreted by the pancreas and enter the small intestine via the pancreatic duct pancreatic enzymes and bile from the gallbladder enter the small intestine in response to the hormone cholecystokinin which is produced in the small intestine in response to the presence of nutrients secretin another hormone produced in the small intestine causes additional effects on the pancreas where it promotes the release of bicarbonate into the duodenum in order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach the three major classes of nutrients that undergo digestion are proteins lipids fats and carbohydrates digested food is now able to pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine through either diffusion or active transport the small intestine is the site where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed the inner wall or mucosa of the small intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelial tissue structurally the mucosa is covered in wrinkles or folds called plicae circulares which are considered permanent features in the wall of the organ they are distinct from rugae which are considered nonpermanent or temporary allowing for distention and contraction from the plicae circulares project microscopic fingerlike pieces of tissue called villi latin for shaggy hair the individual epithelial cells also have fingerlike projections known as microvilli the functions of the plicae circulares the villi and the microvilli are to increase the amount of surface area available for the absorption of nutrients and to limit the loss of said nutrients to intestinal fauna each villus has a network of capillaries and fine lymphatic vessels called lacteals close to its surface the epithelial cells of the villi transport nutrients from the lumen of the intestine into these capillaries amino acids and carbohydrates and lacteals lipids the absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as the proteins required by our body the material that remains undigested and unabsorbed passes into the large intestine absorption of the majority of nutrients takes place in the jejunum with the following notable exceptions the small intestine supports the bodys immune system  the presence of probiotic gut flora appear to contribute positively to the hosts immune system peyers patches located within the ileum of the small intestine are an important part of the digestive tracts local immune system they are part of the lymphatic system and provide a site for antigens from potentially harmful bacteria or other microorganisms in the digestive tract to be sampled and subsequently presented to the immune system   the small intestine is a complex organ and as such there are a very large number of possible conditions that may affect the function of the small bowel a few of them are listed below some of which are common with up to 10 of people being affected at some time in their lives while others are vanishingly rare the small intestine is found in all tetrapods and also in teleosts although its form and length vary enormously between species in teleosts it is relatively short typically around one and a half times the length of the fishs body it commonly has a number of pyloric caeca small pouchlike structures along its length that help to increase the overall surface area of the organ for digesting food there is no ileocaecal valve in teleosts with the boundary between the small intestine and the rectum being marked only by the end of the digestive epitheliu   in tetrapods the ileocaecal valve is always present opening into the colon the length of the small intestine is typically longer in tetrapods than in teleosts but is especially so in herbivores as well as in mammals and birds which have a higher metabolic rate than amphibians or reptiles the lining of the small intestine includes microscopic folds to increase its surface area in all vertebrates but only in mammals do these develop into true villi  the boundaries between the duodenum jejunum and ileum are somewhat vague even in humans and such distinctions are either ignored when discussing the anatomy of other animals or are essentially arbitrary  there is no small intestine as such in nonteleost fish such as sharks sturgeons and lungfish instead the digestive part of the gut forms a spiral intestine connecting the stomach to the rectum in this type of gut the intestine itself is relatively straight but has a long fold running along the inner surface in a spiral fashion sometimes for dozens of turns this valve greatly increases both the surface area and the effective length of the intestine the lining of the spiral intestine is similar to that of the small intestine in teleosts and nonmammalian tetrapods  in lampreys the spiral valve is extremely small possibly because their diet requires little digestion hagfish have no spiral valve at all with digestion occurring for almost the entire length of the intestine which is not subdivided into different regions  in traditional chinese medicine the small intestine is a yang organ  small intestine in situ greater omentum folded upwards third state of the development of the intestinal canal and peritoneum seen from in front diagrammatic the mode

V the orbitofrontal cortex ofc is a prefrontal cortex region in the frontal lobes in the brain which is involved in the cognitive processing of decisionmaking in nonhuman primates it consists of the association cortex areas brodmann area 11 12 and 13 in humans it consists of brodmann area 10 11 and 47  the ofc is considered anatomically synonymous with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex  therefore the region is distinguished due to the distinct neural connections and the distinct functions it performs  it is defined as the part of the prefrontal cortex that receives projections from the magnocellular medial nucleus of the mediodorsal thalamus and is thought to represent emotion and reward in decision making  it gets its name from its position immediately above the orbits in which the eyes are located considerable individual variability has been found in the ofc of both humans and nonhuman primates  a related area is found in rodents    the human ofc is among the leastunderstood regions of the human brain but it has been proposed that the ofc is involved in sensory integration in representing the affective value of reinforcers and in decisionmaking and expectation  in particular the ofc seems to be important in signaling the expected rewardspunishments of an action given the particular details of a situation  in doing this the brain is capable of comparing the expected rewardpunishment with the actual delivery of rewardpunishment thus making the ofc critical for adaptive learning this is supported by research in humans nonhuman primates and rodents human research has focused on neuroimaging research in healthy participants and neuropsychology research in patients with damage to discrete parts of the ofc research at the university of leipzig shows that the human ofc is activated during intuitive coherence judgements  tracer studies in monkeys have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex shares extensive connections with other association cortices primary sensory and association cortices limbic systems and other subcortical areas corticocortical connections include extensive local projections to and from other prefrontal regions as well as with motor limbic and sensory cortices areas projecting to motor areas are densely interconnected with other prefrontal cortical regions reflecting integration for executive motor control  sensory cortices additionally share highly complex reciprocal connections with the orbitofrontal cortex all sensory modalities are represented in connections with the orbitofrontal cortex including extensive innervation from areas associated with olfaction and gustatory somatic responses  somatosensory cortices including primary areas 1 and 2 particularly in areas associated with innervation of the hand and trigeminal complex indicating the importance of the orbitofrontal cortex in face and hand sensation  functionally distinct pathways for auditory processing in the orbitofrontal cortex include a rostral stream associated with phonetic processing and a more caudal stream terminating just posterior to the orbitofrontal cortex in the periarcuate prefrontal cortex associated with auditoryspatial processing though these connections share extensive overlap both ventral and dorsal visual streams share connections with orbitofrontal cortical areas including rich projections to and from the superior temporal pole important for integration of spatial and object processing  connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex with limbic areas includes reciprocal projections to granular dysgranular and agranular insular cortex parahippocampal regions and the hippocampus particularly ca1 regions in a rostralto caudal gradient  the orbitofrontal cortex additionally shares extensive reciprocal connections with the amygdala and direct and indirect connections to the hypothalamus  additional subcortical projections are shared between the striatum particularly ventral rewardrelated areas   connectivity with thalamic and periaqueductal grey areas further suggests a role for the orbitofrontal cortex in both inhibitory and excitatory regulation of autonomic function  parallel processing loops in connectivity between corticostriatal networks seem to be involved in the processing of goaldirected and habitual action whereas corticolimbic connectivity seems to be of prime importance for action selection implicating the basolateral amygdala and the integration of information into behavioral output  though invasive tracer studies are largely not possible in humans diffusion tensor imaging dti tractography studies have also been used to map the connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex to cortical and subcortical brain structures connections in the human orbitofrontal cortex follow a conserved pattern similar to what is shown in tracer studies in rhesus macaques but with a distinct pattern of connectivity with regions of the striatum  when ofc connections are disrupted a number of cognitive behavioral and emotional consequences may arise research supports that the main disorders associated with dysregulated ofc connectivitycircuitry center around decisionmaking emotion regulation and reward expectation    a recent multimodal human neuroimaging study shows disrupted structural and functional connectivity of the ofc with the subcortical limbic structures eg amygdala or hippocampus and other frontal regions eg dorsoal prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex correlates with abnormal ofc affect eg fear processing in clinically anxious adults  one clear extension of problems with decisionmaking is drug addictionsubstance dependence which can result from disruption of the striatothalamoorbitofrontal circuit    attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd has also been implicated in dysfunction of neural reward circuitry controlling motivation reward and impulsivity including ofc systems  other disorders of executive functioning and impulse control may be affected by ofc circuitry dysregulation such as obsessivecompulsive disorder and trichotillomania    some dementias are also associated with ofc connectivity disruptions the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia  is associated with neural atrophy patterns of white and gray matter projection fibers involved with ofc connectivity  finally some research suggests that later stages of alzheimers disease be impacted by altered connectivity of ofc systems  the ofc has been cytoarchitectonically and connectionally subdivided into a medial and a lateral portion the medial portion has its strongest connections with the hippocampus and associated areas of the cingulate retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices anterior thalamus and septal diagonal band the lateral portion can be further subdivided into three sectors the most caudal sector is characterized by strong connections with the amygdala midline thalamus nonisocortical insula and temporal pole the most anterior sector has more pronounced connections with the granular insula association cortex mediodorsal thalamus inferior parietal lobule and dorsolateral pfc  it is suggested that the medial ofc is involved in making stimulusreward associations and with the reinforcement of behavior while the lateral ofc is involved in stimulusoutcome associations and the evaluation and possibly reversal of behavior  activity in the lateral ofc is found for example when subjects encode new expectations about punishment and social reprisal   it is also found when suppressing negative emotions especially in approachavoidance situations such as the game of chicken  the lateral ofc plays an important role in conflict resolution and damage to this area results in both inappropriate displays of anger and inappropriate responses to the anger of others for example subjects with damage to the left lateral ofc have been found to be defensive and to present themselves in an angelic light  low volume in this area has also been correlated with experiencing fear of god  on the other hand subjects with greater volume in this area have been found to score higher on the mach iv test measuring machiavellian personality traits  and activity in this region has generally been connected with machiavellian thinking   in one study adults who were classified as highreactive as children meaning shy and inhibited were found to have greater cortical thickness in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex while adults who were classified as lowreactive meaning outgoing and uninhibited were found to have greater thickness in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex  involvement of ofc is often implicated in addictive behavior in addition to the nucleus accumbens and amygdala  the striatothalamoorbitofrontal circuit of the ofc has been implicated in the development of addictive behavior via dopaminergic activation of reward circuits as supported by brain imaging studies the ofc has been associated with compulsive behavior and repetitive behavior  as well as with drive  in drug dependent individuals disruption of the striatothalamo orbitofrontal circuit leads to compulsive behavior and increased motivation to take the drug addicted individuals show deficits in orbitofrontal striatal and thalamic regions  conscious and unconscious components are hypothesized to serve as mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of drug addiction conscious mechanisms involve craving associated with loss of control and unconscious elements include anticipated conditioned responses to a drug and impulsivity  brain imaging studies show that during cocaine withdrawal metabolism is increased in the ofc and that this is proportional to drug craving in contrast during protracted up to 34 months withdrawal cocaine abusers show reduced activity in the ofc compared to healthy controls   similarly in alcoholics during withdrawal there is decreased activity in the ofc compared to the ofcs of healthy controls  but in addition detoxified alcoholics have significantly lower levels of benzodiazepine receptors in the ofc compared with healthy controls  hypoactivity in the ofc of alcoholics is also supported by blunted metabolism in the ofc to response to both serotonogenic and gaba ergic agents  the ofc projects and is neuronanatomically connected via the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus to the nucleus accumbens  which is associated with the reinforcing effects of drug administration    the nucleus accumbens projects back to the ofc  as do dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area vta   the latter being associated with the positive reinforcing effects of drugs limbic regions including the amygdala hippocampus and cingulate gyrus also project to the ofc via direct and indirect pathways   and it would appear that the ofc is not only the target for reinforcing drug effects but also serves to integrate information from the limbic system modulating the response of the limbic areas to drugs of abuse and their rewarding effects  for a review see porrino  lyons 2000 stimulating the ofc in laboratory animals results in drug self administration  in animal studies the ofc is hypothesized to not only be associated with the response to reward but also to respond and adjust animal behavior when the rewarding properties of the reinforcement change   as well as learning the association between stimulus and reward the damage to the ofc results in deficits in reversal of stimulus reinforcement in which an animal perseverates on a behavior and fails to extinguish a behavior  this perseveration and inability to extinguish a behavior can be related to drug administration in substance abuse and substance dependence where individuals compulsively selfadminister a drug even with drastic decrease of reinforcing effects of that drug and tolerance to the pleasurable effects and in the presence of adverse consequences of drug use rats who are reintroduced to an environment in which they used cocaine experience activation of the ofc  in addition in rats repeated alcohol use causes degeneration of the ofc  using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to image the human ofc is a challenge because this brain region is in proximity to the airfilled sinuses this means that signal dropout geometric distortion and susceptibility artifacts are common when using epi at higher magnetic field strengths extra care is therefore recommended for obtaining a good signal from the orbitofrontal cortex and a number of strategies have been devised such as automatic shimming at high static magnetic field strengths  the published neuroimaging studies have found that the reward value the expected reward value and even the subjective pleasantness of foods and other reinforcers are represented in the ofc a large metaanalysis of the existing neuroimaging evidence demonstrated that activity in medial parts of the ofc is related to the monitoring learning and memory of the reward value of reinforcers whereas activity in lateral ofc is related to the evaluation of punishers which may lead to a change in ongoing behaviour  similarly a posterioranterior distinction was found with more complex or abstract reinforcers such as monetary gain and loss being represented more anteriorly in the orbitofrontal cortex than lesscomplex reinforcers such as taste it has even been proposed that the human ofc has a role in mediating subjective hedonic experience  the orbitofrontal cortex ofc represents the main neocortical target of primary olfactory cortex in nonhuman primates the olfactory neocortex is situated along the basal surface of the caudal frontal lobes encompassing agranular and dysgranular ofc medially and agranular insula laterally where this latter structure wraps onto the posterior orbital surface direct afferent inputs arrive from most primary olfactory areas including piriform cortex amygdala and entorhinal cortex in the absence of an obligatory thalamic relay  this has two components in the first component reversal learning participants are presented with one of two pictures a and b they learn that they will be rewarded if they press a button when picture a is displayed but punished if they press the button when picture b is displayed once this rule has been established the rule swaps in other words now it is correct to press the button for picture b not picture a most healthy participants pick up on this rule reversal almost immediately but patients with ofc damage continue to respond to the original pattern of reinforcement although they are now being punished for persevering with it rolls et al  noted that this pattern of behaviour is particularly unusual given that the patients reported that they understood the rule the second component of the test is extinction again participants learn to press the button for picture a but not picture b however this time instead of the rules reversing the rule changes altogether now the participant will be punished for pressing the button in response to either picture the correct response is not to press the button at all but people with ofc dysfunction find it difficult to resist the temptation to press the button despite being punished for it a simulation of real life decisionmaking the iowa gambling task is widely used in cognition and emotion research  participants are presented with four virtual decks of cards on a computer screen they are told that each time they choose a card they will win some game money every so often however when they choose a card they will lose some money  they are told that the aim of the game is to win as much money as possible the task is meant to be opaque that is participants are not meant to consciously work out the rule and they are supposed to choose cards based on their gut reaction two of the decks are bad decks which means that over a long enough time they will make a net loss the other two decks are good decks and will make a net gain over time most healthy participants sample cards from each deck and after about 40 or 50 selections are fairly good at sticking to the good decks patients with ofc dysfunction however continue to perseverate with the bad decks sometimes even though they know that they are losing money overall concurrent measurement of galvanic skin response shows that healthy participants show a stress reaction to hovering over the bad decks after only 10 trials long before conscious sensation that the decks are bad by contrast patients with ofc dysfunction never develop this physiological reaction to impending punishment bechara and his colleagues explain this in terms of the somatic marker hypothesis the iowa gambling task is currently being used by a number of research groups using fmri to investigate which brain regions are activated by the task in healthy volunteers as well as clinical groups with conditions such as schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder this is a series of vignettes recounting a social occasion during which someone said something that should not have been said or an awkward occurrence the participants task is to identify what was said that was awkward why it was awkward how people would have felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum  the test is also sensitive to patients with ofc dysfunction who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well destruction of the ofc through acquired brain injury typically leads to a pattern of disinhibited behaviour examples include swearing excessively hypersexuality poor social interaction compulsive gambling drug use including alcohol and tobacco and poor empathising ability disinhibited behaviour by patients with some forms of frontotemporal dementia is thought to be caused by degeneration of the ofc  orbital gyrus shown in red medial surface of cerebral cortex  gyri basal surface of cerebrum oribital

V as in other molluscs the circulatory system of gastropods is open with the fluid or haemolymph flowing through sinuses and bathing the tissues directly the haemolymph typically contains haemocyanin and is blue in colour   the heart is muscular and located in the anterior part of the visceral mass in the great majority of species it has two chambers an auricle which receives haemolymph from the gill or lung and a ventricle which pumps it into the aorta however some primitive gastropods possess two gills each supplying its own auricle so that their heart has three chambers the aorta is relatively short and soon divides into two main vessels one supplying the visceral mass and the other supplying the head and foot in some groups these two vessels arise directly from the heart so that the animal may be said to have two aortas these two vessels in turn divide into many finer vessels throughout the body and deliver haemolymph to open arterial sinuses where it bathes and oxygenates the tissues deoxygenated haemolymph drains into a large venous sinus within the head and foot which contains the nephridium an excretory organ with a function similar to that of the vertebrate kidney from here it passes into vessels within the gill or into the capillary network of the pulmonate lung before returning to the heart in some genera such as the large marine snail busycon the main anterior artery which supplies the head and foot includes an enlarged muscular region this structure is effectively a secondary heart and probably helps to maintain blood pressure in the vessels of the head because of the open circulatory system of gastropods and other molluscs there is no clear distinction between the blood and the lymph or interstitial fluid as a result the circulatory fluid is commonly referred to as haemolymph rather than blood the majority of gastropods have haemolymph containing the respiratory pigment haemocyanin this is a coppercontaining protein that helps to carry oxygen and gives the haemolymph a pale blue colour in the freshwater planorbid snails however the haemocyanin is replaced by haemoglobin and thus their haemolymph is red rather than blue some gastropods such as the sea hare aplysia appear to lack respiratory pigments altogether regardless of whether they employ haemocyanin or haemoglobin the pigments are dissolved directly in the serum with no equivalent of the red blood cells found in mammals however the haemolymph does contain amoebocytes which may have a role in the immune system barnes robert d 1982 invertebrate zoology philadelphia pa holtsaunders international pp365366 isbn0030567475

V the caerphilly heart disease study also known as the caerphilly prospective study caps is an epidemiological prospective cohort set up in 1979 in a representative population sample drawn from caerphilly a typical small town in south wales uk  the initial aim was to examine relationships between a wide range of social lifestyle dietary and other factors with incident vascular disease opportunity was also taken in collaboration with a range of clinical and laboratory colleagues to collect data on a wide range of factors with possible relevance to diseases other than vascular and at the same time to collect clinical information on incident disease events the study was initiated by professor peter elwood obe director of the medical research council mrc epidemiology unit for south wales the work has so far led to over 400 publications in the medical press   in 1948 an mrc epidemiological unit was set up in cardiff south wales under professor archie cochrane peter elwood joined cochrane in 1963 and together they promoted longterm studies of representative population samples they also conducted randomised controlled trials to test a variety of clinical hypotheses undoubtedly the most important of their joint studies was a randomised controlled trial of aspirin showing a reduction of vascular mortality  reported in the british medical journal in 1974 this was the first study to demonstrate a protective role for aspirin in the reduction of death and reinfarction  the british medical journal recognised this article as one of the 50 most frequently cited papers published between 1945 and 1989  following this trial elwood and his research team set up the caerphilly heart disease study  with their primary focus on vascular disease and the identification of predictors for platelet activity and thrombosis caerphilly was chosen for the work because the population was fairly stable it had age and social class structures similar to that of the whole uk population and there was a high incidence of ischaemic heart disease compared with the rest of the uk in 1979 all men aged between 45 and 59 years who were on the electoral registers andor general practice lists for caerphilly and the adjoining villages of abertridwr senghenydd trethomas bedwas and machen were invited to cooperate in a longterm health study 2512 subjects 89 of the total eligible population agreed to participate and were examined in phase 1 baseline between july 1979 and september 1983  since then the men have been reexamined seven times at fiveyear intervals with approximately 95 of the surviving men cooperating in each reexamination many questions and tests have been repeated but the opportunity has also been taken to include new questionnaires and tests in the early phases of the study samples of fasting blood were collected for extensive testing and longterm storage and on occasions urine and other biological samples were also taken and aliquots stored thus while the initial aims of the study focused upon vascular disease the wealth of data collected has enabled the testing of a large number of hypotheses relevant to other diseases too from the start of the study the term collaborative was usually added to the title paying tribute to the many physicians laboratory technicians and other colleagues expert in a wide range of clinical and metabolic disciplines who were actively involved in the work heart disease prevalence is far greater in men than women  therefore women were not included in the study a far larger sample size would have been required if women had been the focus of the study and unfortunately the available resources were not sufficient for this the work in caerphilly was often linked with the speedwell study a similar study operating in nearby bristol 60km away the survey techniques were similar and a number of questionnaires and biological tests were used in both the studies this enabled a number of joint reports on vascular disease and in particular on the relevance of blood lipids to be based on the five thousand subjects within the two cohorts together initially the study was funded by the medical research council and led by peter elwood following elwoods retirement in 1995 the study continued under the leadership of dr john gallacher cardiff university and professor yoav benshlomo bristol university together with dr john yarnell queens university and professor tony bayer cardiff university financial support was obtained from the british heart foundation and the alzheimers society the caerphilly studys research strategy was to identify factors showing an association with vascular disease and other diseases and then to test these associations in randomised controlled trials and statisitical analysis the framingham heart study a much earlier cohort study in the usa had already shown that cholesterol is an important predictive factor for heart disease  and studies of us veterans had shown that raised blood pressure is a major factor in stroke  the caerphilly study retested these predictors together with lipid fractions and highdensity lipoproteins total hdl hdl2 and hdl3  more recently arterial resistance and its contribution to blood pressure has also been studied within the cohort  the randomised controlled trial of aspirin had shown that blood platelets play a key role in vascular disease  the caerphilly study focused on this by developing a large databank of platelet testing during the early phases of the study platelet collection and analysis was undertaken in close collaboration with dr john obrien consultant haematologist in st marys hospital portsmouth professor serge renaud a director of research in the french national institute of health and medical research in lyon and professor rod flower frs then at the university of bath the work was done in a specially equipped mobile platelet laboratory lent to the caerphilly team by serge renaud and towed by him from inserm in lyon france to the miners hospital  detailed work was also completed on thrombosis and haemostatic factors with the active involvement of john obrien and in collaboration with professor gordon lowe in the institute of cardiovascular and medical sciences      at baseline a 13 sample 668 men completed a 7day weighed dietary intake record data on the dietary intake of each subject in the cohort was collected during each phase of the study ten years into the study a detailed package of cognitive function tests were performed by each subject these tests have been repeated several times  and later enabled the evaluation of factors with possible relevance to cognitive decline and dementia the caerphilly study gave opportunity to study the relationship between lifestyle choices and health in a representative population sample drawn from a typical small town in the uk  the participants were asked detailed questions at baseline and at subsequent examinations about lifestyle behaviours enabling the men to be classified in terms of five healthy behaviours  these healthy behaviours displayed significant negative associations with cognitive impairment and dementia with participant disease outcomes falling as the number of healthy behaviours followed increased men who followed four or five of the healthy behaviours during 30 years of followup experienced on average a 73 reduction in diabetes a 67 reduction in vascular disease a 35 reduction in cancer attributable to nonsmoking alone and a 64 reduction in cognitive impairment and dementia  healthy behaviours are the responsibility of each individual  and 1 of the men in the caerphilly study followed all five with only 5 following four consistently  comparisons with data collected in the 2009 welsh health survey indicate that while the pattern of behaviours has changed the proportions of subjects following four or five of the healthy behaviours has scarcely altered over the past 30 years  the caerphilly study estimated the likely effect of increased healthy living within the community by supposing that each man in the caerphilly cohort had each been urged at the start of the study in 1979 to adopt just one additional healthy behaviour if only half of them had complied then over the following 30 years 12 fewer would have developed diabetes 6 fewer would have had a vascular disease event 13 fewer would have developed dementia and there would have been 5 fewer deaths  a video summarising this work is available on youtube  participants were asked to obtain from a close female relative the details of their own birth weight and how they had been fed as infants over half of the men obtained these details and results showed that having been breast fed conferred some protection against the loss of cognitive function later in life particularly in those whose birth weight had been low  smoking alcohol intake and leisure activities are lifestyle factors which were found to be predictive of cognitive function  significant associations were also between cognitive function and blood rheology and negative associations with both haematocrit and plasma viscosity but not with the thrombotic potential of blood as indicated by fibrinogen level  these relationships appear to be direct and not through underlying longterm disease processes sleep pattern and in particular severe daytime sleepiness was also predictive of vascular dementia  in diabetic subjects it was found that poor control of blood sugar was associated with a lower cognitive function and diabetes per se but none of the components of metabolic syndrome other than high blood pressure were predictive of worse cognition  hearing loss was also found to be predictive of later cognitive impairment and incident dementia  the main objective of the work on platelets was to identify an aspect of platelet morphology or activity with predictive power for incident vascular disease which could be developed as a screening test to identify subjects at high risk of a vascular event in addition to number and size of the platelets three tests of platelet aggregation were performed several being repeated after five years a stressed template bleeding time test was also performed on each man no prediction for heart disease was shown by any aspect of platelet morphology nor any platelet test nor by the bleeding time test an unexpected finding was that the men who had had the most active platelets in two tests based on platelet rich plasma and whole blood had the lowest subsequent risk of an incident ischaemic stroke  detailed analyses of the dietary data identified a number of food items related to vascular disease risk the consumption of fatty fish was associated with lower levels of blood lipids  and a reduction in vascular disease mortality was confirmed in a randomised trial  milk consumption was found to be associated with a small reduction in the metabolic syndrome  and reductions in ischaemic heart disease ischaemic stroke and diabetes  and these findings were confirmed in later overviews and metaanalyses  a reduction in blood pressure associated with milk consumption is well recognised but new work in caerphilly also identified a reduction in arterial stiffness associated with milk consumption  the consumption of fruit and vegetables was shown to be positively associated with blood antioxidant levels  detailed work with serge renaud on platelet activity showed a beneficial relationship between a low alcohol consumption and platelet aggregation but an enhanced response to thrombin with binge drinking confirming previous work in animals  a detailed questionnaire of sleep pattern was included in one of the reexaminations of the men in addition to the association with cognitive function already mentioned  there was evidence of an increase in ischaemic stroke in men whose sleep is frequently disturbed and an association between daytime sleepiness and a significant increase in ischaemic heart disease  many analyses of foods and dietary factors were conducted as well as an examination of helicobacter pylori and other infections and vascular disease risk    a reduction in vascular disease mortality was found in those subjects most sexually active  relationships between vascular disease and psychiatric symptoms   noise exposure   and hearing loss  were also identified

V delta cells \u03b4cells or d cells are somatostatinproducing cells they can be found in the stomach intestine and the pancreatic islets in rodents deltacells are located in the periphery of the islets in humans the islet architecture is generally less organized and deltacells are frequently observed inside the islets as well viewed under an electron microscope deltacells can be identified as cells with smaller and slightly more compact granules than beta cells d cells contain cckbr which respond to gastrin and m3 receptors which respond to ach respectively these receptors will increase somatostatin output and decrease somatostatin output from the d cells vip vasoactive intestinal peptide acts positively on d cells resulting in more somatostatin being released a tumor of the delta cells is called a somatostatinoma when a person is infected with h pylori the lower region of the stomach the antrum is predominantly inflamed this is where most of the d cells in the stomach are the bacteria produce a cloud of ammonia around themselves using urease to protect them from the stomach acid however this reacts with the acid producing ammonium which is toxic to cells this leads to many of the d cells dying and therefore a lower level of somatostatin being secreted this results in higher levels of gastrin and stomach acid being secreted this combined with the damage from ammonium leads to ulceration of the stomach wall

V multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods previously known as multiple organ failure mof total organ failure tof or multisystem organ failure msof is altered organ function in an acutely ill patient requiring medical intervention to achieve homeostasis the use of multiple organ failure or multisystem organ failure should be avoided since that phrase was based upon physiological parameters to determine whether or not a particular organ was failing    multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the presence of altered organ function in acutely ill patients such that homeostasis cannot be maintained without intervention it usually involves two or more organ systems  the condition usually results from infection injury accident surgery hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism the primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response sepsis is the most common cause in operative and nonoperative patients sepsis may result in septic shock in the absence of infection a sepsislike disorder is termed systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs both sirs and sepsis could ultimately progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome however in onethird of the patients no primary focus can be found  multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is well established as the final stage of a continuum sirs  infection  sepsis  severe sepsis  multiple organ dysfunction syndrome currently investigators are looking into genetic targets for possible gene therapy to prevent the progression to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome some authors have conjectured that the inactivation of the transcription factors nf\u03bab and ap1 would be appropriate targets in preventing sepsis and sirs  these two genes are proinflammatory however they are essential components of a normal healthy immune response so there is risk of increasing vulnerability to infection which can also cause clinical deterioration some have developed a mouse model sepsis via cecal ligation and puncture clp  male balbc mice subjected to clp were given an il10carrying vector or an empty control vector lung liver and kidney tissue destruction were measured by assessing myeloperoxidase and malonialdehyde activity these last two are endogenous oxidizing compounds produced during tissue inflammation the authors assessed the level neutrophil infiltration in lung and liver tissue il10 protein expression was measured using immunohistochemistry the expression of tumor necrosis factoralpha tnf\u03b1 mrna was measured at 3 8 and 24 hours after clp using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction their results show significantly reduced organ damage by il10 gene transfer as quantified by reduced myeloperoxidase activity in the lung liver and kidney the malonialdehyde level was not affected by the transfer into the liver the livers of the mice infected with the adenoviral vector showed reduced neutrophil activity the lung and kidney samples in mice carrying the gene showed lower expression of tnf\u03b1 mrna the investigators concluded that increased il10 expression significantly reduced sepsisinduced multiple organ injury a definite explanation has not been found local and systemic responses are initiated by tissue damage respiratory failure is common in the first 72 hours after the original insult subsequently one might see liver failure 57 days gastrointestinal bleeding 1015 days and kidney failure 1117 days  the most popular hypothesis by deitch to explain mods in critically ill patients is the gut hypothesis  due to splanchnic hypoperfusion and the subsequent mucosal ischaemia there are structural changes and alterations in cellular function this results in increased gut permeability changed immune function of the gut and increased translocation of bacteria liver dysfunction leads to toxins escaping into the systemic circulation and activating an immune response this results in tissue injury and organ dysfunction  gramnegative infections in mods patients are relatively common hence endotoxins have been advanced as principal mediator in this disorder it is thought that following the initial event cytokines are produced and released the proinflammatory mediators are tumor necrosis factoralpha tnf\u03b1 interleukin1 interleukin6 thromboxane a2 prostacyclin platelet activating factor and nitric oxide  as a result of macro and microvascular changes insufficient supply of oxygen occurs hypoxemia causes cell death and organ dysfunction   according to findings of professor zsolt balohh and his team at university of newcastle australia mitochondrial dna is the leading cause of severe inflammation due to massive amount of mitochondrial dna that leaks into the blood stream due to cell death into the blood stream of patients that survived major trauma mitochondrial dna is very similarlooking like bacterial dna and if bacteria is triggering leukocytes maybe the mitochondrial dna does the same when confronted with bacteria white blood cells or neutrophil granulocyte behave like predatory spiders they spit out a web or net to trap the invaders then hit them with a deadly oxidative blast neutrophil extracellular traps nets this result in catastrophic immune response leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome   since in most cases no primary cause is found the condition could be part of a compromised homeostasis involving the previous mechanisms  the european society of intensive care organized a consensus meeting in 1994 to create the sepsisrelated organ failure assessment sofa score to describe and quantitate the degree of organ dysfunction in six organ systems using similar physiologic variables the multiple organ dysfunction score was developed  four clinical phases have been suggested at present there is no agent that can reverse the established organ failure therapy therefore is limited to supportive care ie safeguarding hemodynamics and respiration maintaining adequate tissue oxygenation is a principal target starting enteral nutrition within 36 hours of admission to an intensive care unit has reduced infectious complications  mortality varies from 30 to 100 where the chance of survival is diminished as the number of organs involved increases since the 1980s the mortality rate has not changed  in patients with sepsis septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is due to major trauma the rs1800625 polymorphism is a functional single nucleotide polymorphism a part of the receptor for advanced glycation end products rage transmembrane receptor gene of the immunoglobulin superfamily and confers host susceptibility to sepsis and mods in these patients  the historical origin of the concept of mods is as follows for many years some patients were loosely classified as having sepsis or the sepsis syndrome in more recent years these concepts have been refined  so that there are specific definitions of sepsis  and two new concepts have been developed the sirs and mods

V the institutes for the achievement of human potential iahp founded in 1955 by glenn doman and carl delacato provides literature on and teaches patterning therapy which the institutes promote as improving the neurologic organization of brain injured and healthy children through diet and exercise   it is headquartered in philadelphia pennsylvania with offices and programs offered in several other countries  pattern therapy has been widely criticized and multiple studies have found the therapy ineffective       the institutes for the achievement of human potential iahp also known as the institutes was founded in 1955  it practices pattern therapy which was developed by doman and educational psychologist carl delacato  pattern therapy drew upon the ideas and work of ideas of neurophysiologist temple fay former head of the department of neurosurgery at temple university school of medicine and president of the philadelphia neurological society   fay believed in recapitulation theory which posits that the infant brain evolves through chronological stages of development similar to first a fish a reptile a mammal and finally a human this theory can be encapsulated as ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny recapitulation theory has been largely discredited in biology   in 1960 doman and delacato published an article in the journal of the american medical association jama detailing pattern therapy  the methodology of their study was later criticized   the american academy of pediatrics and other organizations have criticized the iahps claims of effectiveness theoretical basis and the demands placed on parents by iahp programs   early studies originating from iahp appeared to show some value of their program but were later criticized as significantly flawed   kenneth kavale and mark mostert have written that later studies they believe to have better design and more objectivity have shown pattern therapy to be practically without merit  the institutes consider brain damage mental retardation mental deficiency cerebal palsy epilepsy austism athetosis attention deficit hyperactivity disorder developmental delay and down syndrome as conditions encompassing brain injury the term favored by iahp  according to a 2007 wpvi television news report iahp uses the word hurt to describe the children they see with all kinds of brain injuries and conditions including cerebral palsy mental retardation epilepsy downs syndrome attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism  iahps program begins with a fiveday seminar for the parents of brain injured children because the program is carried out by parents at their homes  following the seminar iahp conducts an initial evaluation of the child  the program described in the 1960 jama paper doman et al for braininjured children included the iahp claims that brain injury at a given level of neurological development prevents further progress   this model of childhood development has been criticized in the scientific community  other therapies utilized by iahp include eye exercises for children who have an eye that converges more than the other when looking at an object in the distance and those who have one eye that diverges more than the other when an object is moved slowly toward the bridge of the nose iahp also recommends stimulating the eyes of children with amblyopia by flashing a light on and off for children with poor hearing iahp recommends auditory stimulation with loud noises which may be prerecorded braininjured children may also be taught to identify by touch alone various objects placed in a bag  iahp recommends dietary restrictions including reduced fluid intake for braininjured children in an attempt to prevent the possible overaccumulation of cerebrospinal fluid alongside fluid restriction iahp recommends a diet low in salt sweets and other thirst provoking foods  in their book controversial issues in special education garry hornby jean howard and mary atkinson state the program also includes gagging in which the child breathes into a plastic bag until gasping for breath this is based on the belief that it will cause maximum use of the lungs and thus maximize oxygen circulation to the brain  the book concludes that pattern therapy is ineffective and potentially damaging to the functioning of families  according to the american academy of pediatrics patterning treatment is based on an oversimplified theory of brain development and its effectiveness is not supported by evidencebased medicine making its use unwarranted  the american academy of pediatrics committee on children with disabilities issued warnings regarding patterning one of the iahps therapies for brain injured children as early as 1968  and repeated in 1982  their latest cautionary policy statement was in 1999 which was reaffirmed in 2010  states this treatment is based on an outmoded and oversimplified theory of brain development current information does not support the claims of proponents that this treatment is efficacious and its use continues to be unwarranted the demands and expectations placed on families are so great that in some cases their financial resources may be depleted substantially and parental and sibling relationships could be stressed  in addition to the american academy of pediatrics a number of other organizations have issued cautionary statements about claims for efficacy of this therapy  these include the executive committee of the american academy for cerebral palsy  the united cerebral palsy association of texas  the canadian association for retarded children  the executive board of the american academy of neurology  and the american academy of physical medicine and rehabilitation  hornby et al call ra cummins 1988 book the neurologically impairedchild domandelacato techniques reappraised croom helm isbn 9780709948599 the most comprehensive analysis of the rationale and effectiveness of the domandelacato programme to date and state cummins uses neuroanatomy and neurophysiology to demonstrate that there is no sound scientific basis for the techniques used by the iahp and concludes any benefit is likely due to increased activity and attention hornby et al conclude it is now clear that the only results supporting the effectiveness of the programme come from a handful of early poorly controlled studies  kavale and mostert and others also identified serious problems with the early research on the iahp program   an analysis of higher quality studies found that students not receiving the treatment had better outcomes than those who were treated by the iahp  the iahp has asserted in the past that it was willing and interested in participating in controlled scientific studies   the iahp has instructed parents of children in their program not to take part in any independent studies designed to evaluate the programs effectiveness  the iahp withdrew its agreement to participate in a carefully designed study supported by federal and private agencies when the study was in its final planning stages  according to herman spitz the iahp no longer appears to be interested in a scientific evaluation of their techniques they have grown large wealthy and independent and their staff is satisfied to provide case histories and propaganda tracts in support of their claims  similarly terrence m hines stated that they have shown very little interest in providing empirical support for their methods  a 15 patient 2012 norwegian cost analysis of an unproven intensive training treatment for brain damage that included 11 patients treated by iahp found the treatment regimen not cost effective the authors expressed doubt that the treatments could achieve adequate benefits to be cost effective and concluded that health care services should only fund these treatments for clinical trials  a 2013 study found the claims of superior results of treatment by the iahp were not substantiated  a 2006 retrospective study of 21 children by the iahp and others of children with cortical visual impairment found significant improvement after use of the program the study had no control group  norum et al stated regarding this study any proof of effectiveness cannot be obtained from a nonrandomized study  doctors martha farrell erickson and karen marie kurzriemer wrote that iahp capitalized on the desires of members of the baby boom generation to maximize their childrens intellectual potential and encouraged parents to push their infants to develop maximum brain power but most contemporary child development experts described many aspects of the program as useless and perhaps even harmful  kathleen quill concluded that that professionals have nothing to learn from pattern therapy  pavone and ruggieri have written that pattern therapy does not have an important role in treatment  neurologist steven novella has characterized pattern therapy as being based on a discarded theory and a false cure  he also wrote that iahps unsubstantiated claims can cause both financial and emotional damage  while detailing criticism of pattern therapy robards also wrote that the therapy caused pediatricians and therapists to recognize that early intervention programs are necessary

V the opisthonephros is the functional adult kidney in lampreys cyclostomes most fishes and amphibians  it is formed from the extended mesonephros along with tubules from the posterior nephric ridge  the functional embryonic kidney in anamniotes is the pronephros kerr coined the term opisthonephros in 1919  in 1949 hyman wrote the opisthonephros has used up the mesomere tissue from which in amniotes both mesonephros and metanephros come  some accounts call opisthonephros the mesonephros but the opisthonephros in anamniotes lampreys fish and amphibians differ considerably than the mesonephros in amniotes reptiles birds and mammals  thus the term mesonephros is usually reserved for the embryonic kidney of amniotes  the mesonephros and metanephros of amniotes are derived from different parts of the anamniote opisthonephros  the metanephros is derived from the posterior part of the opisthonephros  in amniotes most of the former opisthonephros became the epididymis and the archinephric duct became the vas deferens

V a penis plural penises or penes ni\u02d0z is the primary sexual organ that male and hermaphrodite animals use to inseminate sexually receptive mates usually females and hermaphrodites respectively during copulation  such organs occur in many animals both vertebrate and invertebrate but males do not bear a penis in every animal species and in those species in which the male does bear a socalled penis the penes in the various species are not necessarily homologous for example the penis of a mammal is at most analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle  the term penis applies to many intromittent organs but not to all for example the intromittent organ of most cephalopoda is the hectocotylus a specialised arm and male spiders use their pedipalps even within the vertebrata there are morphological variants with specific terminology such as hemipenes in most species of animals in which there is an organ that might reasonably be described as a penis it has no major function other than intromission or at least conveying the sperm to the female  but in the placental mammals the penis bears the distal part of the urethra which discharges both urine during urination and semen during copulation     most male birds eg roosters and turkeys have a cloaca also present on the female but not a penis among bird species with a penis are paleognathes tinamous and ratites  anatidae ducks geese and swans  and a very few other species including flamingoes  and chickens  a bird penis is different in structure from mammal penises being an erectile expansion of the cloacal wall and being erected by lymph not blood  it is usually partially feathered and in some species features spines and brushlike filaments and in flaccid state curls up inside the cloaca the lake duck also called argentine bluebill has the largest penis in relation to body size of all vertebrates while usually about half the body size 20cm a specimen with a penis 425cm long is documented while most male birds have no external genitalia male waterfowl anatidae have a phallus most birds mate with the males balancing on top of the females and touching cloacas in a cloacal kiss this makes forceful insemination very difficult the phallus that male waterfowl have evolved everts out of their bodies in a clockwise coil and aids in inseminating females without their cooperation  the male waterfowl evolution of a phallus to forcefully copulate with females has led to counteradaptations in females in the form of vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils these structures make it harder for males to achieve intromission the clockwise coils are significant because the male phallus everts out of their body in a counterclockwise spiral therefore a clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation studies have shown that the longer a males phallus is the more elaborate the vaginal structures were  the lake duck is notable for possessing in relation to body length the longest penis of all vertebrates the penis which is typically coiled up in flaccid state can reach about the same length as the animal himself when fully erect but is more commonly about half the birds length   it is theorized that the remarkable size of their spiny penises with bristled tips may have evolved in response to competitive pressure in these highly promiscuous birds removing sperm from previous matings in the manner of a bottle brush male and female emus are similar in appearance  although the males penis can become visible when it defecates  the male tinamou has a corkscrew shaped penis similar to those of the ratites and to the hemipenis of some reptiles females have a small phallic organ in the cloaca which becomes larger during the breeding season  as with any other bodily attribute the length and girth of the penis can be highly variable between mammals of different species   in many mammals the size of a flaccid penis is smaller than its erect size in the realm of absolute size the smallest vertebrate penis belongs to the common shrew 5mm or 02 inches  a bone called the baculum or os penis is present in most mammals but absent in humans cattle and horses in mammals the penis is divided into three parts  the internal structures of the penis consist mainly of cavernous erectile tissue which is a collection of blood sinusoids separated by sheets of connective tissue trabeculae some mammals have a lot of erectile tissue relative to connective tissue for example horses because of this a horses penis can enlarge more than a bulls penis the urethra is on the ventral side of the body of the penis as a general rule a mammals penis is proportional to its body size but this varies greatly between species even between closely related ones for example an adult gorillas erect penis is about 4cm 15in in length an adult chimpanzee significantly smaller in body size than a gorilla has a penis size about double that of the gorilla in comparison the human penis is larger than that of any other primate both in proportion to body size and in absolute terms  when mating the tip of a male pronghorns penis is often the first part to touch the female pronghorn  the pronghorns penis is about 5 inches long and is shaped like an ice pick  the front of a pronghorns glans penis is relatively flat while the back is relatively thick  the male pronghorn usually ejaculates immediately after intromission   the penis of a dromedary camel is covered by a triangular penile sheath opening backwards  and is about 60cm 24in long   the camelmen often aid the male to enter his penis into the females vulva though the male is considered able to do it on his own copulation time ranges from 7 to 35 minutes averaging 1115 minutes    bulls have a fibroelastic penis given the small amount of erectile tissue there is little enlargement after erection the penis is quite rigid when nonerect and becomes even more rigid during erection protrusion is not affected much by erection but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure    bulls rams and boars have an sshaped penis with a sigmoid flexure which straightens out during erection  a boars penis which rotates rhythmically during copulation  is about 18 inches long and ejaculates about a pint of semen  wild boars have a roughly eggsized sack near the opening of the penis which collects urine and emits a sharp odour the purpose of this is not fully understood    stallions have a vascular penis when nonerect it is quite flaccid and contained within the prepuce foreskin or sheath  tapirs have exceptionally long penises relative to their body size     the glans of the malayan tapir resembles a mushroom and is similar to the glans of the horse  a stags penis forms an sshaped curve when it is not erect and is retracted into its sheath by the retractor penis muscle  some deer species spray urine on their bodies by urinating from an erect penis  one type of scentmarking behavior in elk is known as thrashurination   which typically involves palpitation of the erect penis    a male elks urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis  a sambar stag will mark himself by spraying urine directly in the face with a highly mobile penis which is often erect during its rutting activities  red deer stags often have erect penises during combat   all members of carnivora except hyenas have a baculum   canine penises have a structure at the base called the bulbus glandis   during copulation the spotted hyena inserts his penis through the females pseudopenis instead of directly through the vagina which is blocked by the false scrotum and testes once the female retracts her clitoris the male enters the female by sliding beneath her an operation facilitated by the peniss upward angle   the pseudopenis closely resembles the male hyenas penis but can be distinguished from the males genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans  in male spotted hyenas as well as females the base of the glans is covered with penile spines     domestic cats have barbed penises with about 120150 one millimeter long backwardspointing spines  upon withdrawal of the penis the spines rake the walls of the females vagina which is a trigger for ovulation lions also have barbed penises   male felids urinate backwards by curving the tip of the glans penis backward   when male cheetahs urinemark their territories they stand one meter away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60 upward   the male fossa has an unusually long penis and baculum penis bone reaching to between his front legs when erect with an average thickness of 20mm 08in the glans extends about halfway down the shaft and is spiny except at the tip in comparison the glans of felids is short and spiny while that of viverrids is smooth and long  fossa mating includes a copulatory tie which may be enforced by the males spiny penis this unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the males erect penis which has backwardspointing spines along most of its length  the male fossa has scent glands near the penis with the penile glands emitting a strong odor  the beech martens penis is larger than the pine martens with the bacula of young beech martens often outsizing those of old pine martens  raccoons have penis bones which bend at a 90 degree angle at the tip  the extrusibility of a raccoons penis can be used to distinguish mature males from immature males   male walruses possess large penis bones up to 63cm 25in in length the largest of any land mammal both in absolute size and relative to body size   the adult male american minks penis is 22in 56cm long and is covered by a sheath the baculum is welldeveloped being triangular in cross section and curved at the tip   cetaceans have fibroelastic penises similar to those of artiodactyla the tip of the cetacean penis which tapers toward the end is called the pars intrapraeputialis or terminal cone  the blue whale has the largest penis of any organism on the planet typically measuring 810 feet 2430m  accurate measurements of the blue whale are difficult to take because the whales erect length can only be observed during mating  the penis on a right whale can be up to 27m 89ft  the testes at up to 2m 66ft in length 78cm 256ft in diameter and weighing up to 525lb 238kg are also by far the largest of any animal on earth   dolphins reproductive organs are located on the underside of the body male dolphins have two slits one concealing the penis and one further behind for the anus     on at least one occasion a dolphin was known to tow bathers through the water by hooking his large penis around them  between male bottlenose dolphins homosexual behaviour includes rubbing of genitals against each other which sometimes leads to the males swimming belly to belly inserting the penis in the others genital slit and sometimes anus  males of raceys pipistrelle bat have a long straight penis with a notch between the shaft and the narrow eggshaped glans penis near the top the penis is haired but the base is almost naked in the baculum penis bone the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved  the length of the penis and baculum distinguish praceyi from all comparably sized african and malagasy vespertilionids pendoi ppaterculus and pabramus have more similar bacula but that of pabramus is more curved the shaft and the tip are more robust in ppaterculus and the proximal near end is more robust in pendoi  in males penis length is 96 to 118mm 038 to 046in and baculum length is 88 to 100mm 035 to 039in  copulation by male greater shortnosed fruit bats is dorsoventral and the females lick the shaft or the base of the males penis but not the glans which has already penetrated the vagina while the females do this the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation post copulation genital grooming has also been observed  the glans penis of the marsh rice rat is long and robust  averaging 73mm 029in long and 46mm 018in broad and the baculum penis bone is 66mm 026in long  as is characteristic of sigmodontinae the marsh rice rat has a complex penis with the distal far end of the baculum ending in three digits  the central digit is notably larger than those at the sides  the outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue the papilla nipplelike projection on the dorsal upper side of the penis is covered with small spines a character the marsh rice rat shares only with oligoryzomys and oryzomys couesi among oryzomyines examined  on the urethral process located in the crater at the end of the penis  a fleshy process the subapical lobule is present it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except ocouesi and holochilus brasiliensis  the baculum is deeper than it is wide  in transandinomys talamancae the outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue  some features of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines in transandinomys talamancae  a single pair of preputial glands is present at the penis as is usual for sigmodontines there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands part of the end of the vesicular gland is irregularly folded not smooth as in most oryzomyines  in pseudorhyzomys the baculum penis bone displays large protuberances at the sides in the cartilaginous part of the baculum the central digit is smaller than those at the sides  in drymoreomys there are three digits at the tip of the penis of which the central one is the largest the two lateral digits are not supported by mounds of the baculum penis bone there is only one spine on the papilla nipplelike projection on the upper side of the penis on the urethral process located in the crater at the end of the penis a fleshy process at the side the lateral lobule is present the preputial glands glands in front of the genitals are large the lack of lateral bacular mounds presence of a lateral lobule and size of the preputial glands are all unique traits among the oryzomyines  in thomasomys ucucha the glans penis is rounded short and small and is superficially divided into left and right halves by a trough at the top and a ridge at the bottom most of the glans is covered with spines except for an area near the tip  the glans penis of a male cape ground squirrel is large with a prominent baculum  unlike the penises of other squirrel species a red squirrels penis is long thin and narrow without a prominent baculum   winkelmanns mouse can easily be distinguished from its close relatives by the shape of its penis which has a partially corrugated glans  the foreskin of a capybara is attached to the anus in an unusual way forming an anogenital invagination  it has been postulated that the shape of the human penis may have been selected by sperm competition the shape could have favored displacement of seminal fluids implanted within the female reproductive tract by rival males the thrusting action which occurs during sexual intercourse can mechanically remove seminal fluid out of the cervix area from a previous mating  the penile morphology of some types of strepsirrhine primates has provided information about their taxonomy  male galago species possess very distinctive penile morphology that can be used to classify species in o crassicaudatus the penis is on average 20mm 079in in length and increases in width towards the distal tip the baculum clearly protrudes from the end the glans and shaft are covered in single keratinized spines that point towards the body    the northern greater galago penis is on average 18mm 071in in length and width of shaft is even from body to bottom of tip the baculum is clearly visible at the tip the glans terminates with a characteristic set of curves which does not occur in any other species the surface is spined with doubled headed or even tridentate spines pointing towards the body they are less densely packed than in otolemur crassicaudatus    the penis of the ringtailed lemur is nearly cylindrical in shape and is covered in small spines as well as having two pairs of larger spines on both sides males have a relatively small baculum penis bone compared to their size the scrotum penis and prepuce are usually coated with a foulsmelling secretion  the adult male of each vervet monkey species has a pale blue scrotum and a red penis   and male proboscis monkeys have a red penis with a black scrotum  male baboons and squirrel monkeys sometimes gesture with an erect penis as both a warning of impeding danger and a threat to predators   genital display among male squirrel monkeys is an important social signal in relation to group hierarchy it is derived from sexual behavior but is used for social communication  it involves the animal spreading his thighs and having an erect penis  the human penis is an external sex organ of male humans it is a reproductive intromittent organ that additionally serves as the urinal duct the main parts are the root of the penis radix it is the attached part consisting of the bulb of penis in the middle and the crus of penis one on either side of the bulb the body of the penis corpus and the epithelium of the penis consists of the shaft skin the foreskin and the preputial mucosa on the inside of the foreskin and covering the glans penis the human penis is made up of three columns of tissue two corpora cavernosa lie next to each other on the dorsal side and one corpus spongiosum lies between them on the ventral side the urethra which is the last part of the urinary tract traverses the corpus spongiosum and its opening known as the meatus mi\u02d0\u02c8e\u026at\u0259s lies on the tip of the glans penis it is a passage both for urine and for the ejaculation of semen in males the expulsion of urine from the body is done through the penis the urethra drains the bladder through the prostate gland where it is joined by the ejaculatory duct and then onward to the penis an erection is the stiffening and rising of the penis which occurs during sexual arousal though it can also happen in nonsexual situations ejaculation is the ejecting of semen from the penis and is usually accompanied by orgasm a series of muscular contractions delivers semen containing male gametes known as sperm cells or spermatozoa from the penis the most common form of genital alteration is circumcision removal of part or all of the foreskin for various cultural religious and more rarely medical reasons there is controversy surrounding circumcision while results vary across studies the consensus is that the average erect human penis is approximately 12915cm 5159in in length with 95 of adult males falling within the interval 107191cm 4275in  neither patient age nor size of the flaccid penis accurately predicted erectile length the penis of the bush hyrax is complex and distinct from that of the other hyrax genera it has a short thin appendage within a cuplike glans penis and measures greater than 6 centimetres 24in when erect additionally it has been observed that the bush hyrax also has a greater distance between the anus and preputial opening in comparison to other hyraxes   an adult elephant has the largest penis of any land animal   an elephants penis can reach a length of 100cm 39in and a diameter of 16cm 6in at the base  it is sshaped when fully erect and has a yshaped orifice  during musth a male elephant may urinate with his penis still in the sheath which causes the urine to spray on the hind legs   an elephants penis is very mobile being able to move independently of the males pelvis  and the penis curves forward and upward prior to mounting another elephant  in giant anteaters the retracted penis and testes are located internally between the rectum and urinary bladder  when the male armadillo chaetophractus villosus is sexually aroused species determination is easier its penis can be as long as 35 millimetres 14in and usually remains completely withdrawn inside a skin receptacle  scientists conducting studies on the c villosus penis muscles revealed this species very long penis exhibits variability during its waking hours it remains hidden beneath a skin receptacle until it becomes erect and it projects outside in a rostral direction during its slow wave sleep phase penile protrusion makes some very complex movements the penis during this phase is not erect but remains outside of its receptacle during paradoxical sleep no erections occur and the penile muscles share the characteristics of the rest of the body   most marsupials except for the two largest species of kangaroos have a bifurcated penis separated into two columns so that the penis has two ends corresponding to the females two vaginas  male echidnas have a fourheaded penis  during mating the heads on one side shut down and do not grow in size the other two are used to release semen into the females twobranched reproductive tract the heads used are swapped each time the mammal copulates  when not in use the penis is retracted inside a preputial sac in the cloaca the male echidnas penis is 7 centimetres 28in long when erect and its shaft is covered with penile spines  the male shortbeaked echidna has a highly unusual penis with four knobs on the tip  which is nearly a quarter of his body length when erect  each side of the bilaterally symmetrical rosettelike fourheaded penis similar to that of reptiles and 7 centimetres 28in in length is used alternately with the other half being shut down between ejaculations   monotremes and marsupial moles are the only mammals in which the penis is located inside the cloaca   male turtles and crocodiles have a penis while male specimens of the reptile order squamata have two paired organs called hemipenes tuataras must use their cloacae for reproduction  in some fishes the gonopodium andropodium and claspers are intromittent organs to introduce sperm into the female developed from modified fins the record for the largest penis to body size ratio is held by the barnacle the barnacles penis can grow to up to forty times its own body length this enables them to reach the nearest female a number of invertebrate species have independently evolved the mating technique of traumatic insemination where the penis penetrates the females abdomen and deposits sperm in the wound it produces this has been most fully studied in bed bugs in millipedes that have them the penis is simply one or two projections on underneath the third body segment that produce a spermatophore or sperm packet the act of insemination however occurs through specialized legs called gonopods which collect the spermatophore and insert it into the female in male insects the structure analogous to a penis is known as aedeagus the male copulatory organ of various lower invertebrate animals is often called the cirrus  the lesser water boatmans mating call generated by rubbing the penis against the abdomen is the loudest sound relative to body size in the animal kingdom  in 2010 entomologist charles linehard described neotrogla a new genus of barkflies species of this genus have sexreversed genitalia females have penislike organs called gynosomes that are inserted into vaginalike openings of males during mating  in 2014 a detailed study of the insects reproductive habits led by kazunori yoshizawae confirmed that the organ functions similar to a penis  for example it swells during sexual intercourse  and is used to extract sperm from the male   the penis in most male coleoid cephalopods is a long and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified arm called a hectocotylus that in turn is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female in species where the hectocotylus is missing the penis is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female deep water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile barnacles penis elongation in onykia ingens may result in a penis that is as long as the mantle head and arms combined   giant squid of the genus architeuthis are unusual in that they possess both a large penis and modified arm tips although it is uncertain whether the latter are used for spermatophore transfer  the word penis is taken from the latin word for tail some derive that from indoeuropean pesnis and the greek word \u03c0\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2  penis from indoeuropean pesos prior to the adoption of the latin word in english the penis was referred to as a yard the oxford english dictionary cites an example of the word yard used in this sense from 1379  and notes that in his physical dictionary of 1684 steven blankaart defined the word penis as the yard made up of two nervous bodies the channel nut skin and foreskin etc  as with nearly any aspect of the body involved in sexual or excretory functions the penis is the subject of many slang words and euphemisms for it a particularly common and enduring one being cock see wikisauruspenis for a list of alternative words for penis the latin word phallus from greek \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is sometimes used to describe the penis although phallus originally was used to describe representations pictorial or carved of the penis  pizzle an archaic english word for penis of low german or dutch origin is now used to denote the penis of a nonhuman animal  the adjectival form of the word penis is penile this adjective is commonly used in describing various accessory structures of male copulatory organs found in many kinds of invertebrate animals  pizzles are represented in heraldry where the adjective pizzled or vilené  indicates that part of an animate charges anatomy especially if ed differently

V a defining feature of the brain is its capacity to undergo changes based on activitydependent functions also called activitydependent plasticity its ability to remodel itself forms the basis of the brains capacity to retain memories improve motor function and enhance comprehension and speech amongst other things it is this trait to retain and form memories that is functionally linked to plasticity and therefore many of the functions individuals perform on a daily basis  this plasticity is the result of changed gene expression that occurs because of organized cellular mechanisms  the brains ability to adapt toward active functions has allowed humans to specialize in specific processes based on relative use and activity for example a righthanded person may perform any movement poorly with hisher left hand but continuous practice with the less dominant hand can make both hands just as able another example is if someone was born with a neurological disorder such as autism or had a stroke that resulted in a disorder then they are capable of retrieving much of their lost function by practicing and rewiring the brain in order to incorporate these lost manners  thanks to the pioneers within this field many of these advances have become available to most people and many more will continue to arrive as new features of plasticity are discovered   during the first half of the 1900s the word plasticity was considered foul and directly and indirectly rejected throughout science many scientists found it hard to receive funding because nearly everyone unanimously supported the fact that the brain was fully developed at adulthood and specific regions were unable to change functions after the critical period it was believed that each region of the brain had a set and specific function despite closedmindedness and ignorance several pioneers pushed the idea of plasticity through means of various experiments and research there are others that helped to the current progress of activitydependent plasticity but the following contributed very effective results and ideas early on the history of activitydependent plasticity begins with paul bach y rita with conventional ideology being that the brain development is finalized upon adulthood bach y rita designed several experiments in the late 1960s and 1970s that proved that the brain is capable of changing these included a pivotal visual substitution method for blind people provided by tactile image projection in 1969  the basis behind this experiment was to take one sense and use it to detect another in this case use the sense of touch on the tongue to visualize the surrounding this experiment was years ahead of its time and lead to many questions and applications a similar experiment was reported again by bach y rita in 1986 where vibrotactile stimulation were delivered to the index fingertips of naive blindfolded subjects  even though the experiment did not yield great results it supported the study and proposed further investigations in 1998 his design was even further developed and tested again with a 49point electrotactile stimulus array on the tongue  he found that five sighted adult subjects recognized shapes across all sizes 798 of the time a remarkable finding that has led to the incorporation of the tongue electrotactile stimulus into cosmetically acceptable and practical designs for blind people in later years he has published a number of other articles including seeing with the brain in 2003 where bach y rita addresses the plasticity of the brain relative to visual learning  here images are enhanced and perceived by other plastic mechanisms within the realm of information passing to the brain another pioneer within the field of activitydependent plasticity is michael merzenich currently a professor in neuroscience at the university of california san francisco he is considered an expert on brain plasticity and has a long list of achievements and contributions toward the field one of his contributions includes mapping out and documenting the reorganization of cortical regions after alterations due to plasticity  while assessing the recorded changes in the primary somatosensory cortex of adult monkeys he looked at several features of the data including how altered schedules of activity from the skin remap to cortical modeling and other factors that affect the representational remodeling of the brain his findings within these studies have since been applied to youth development and children with languagebased learning impairments through many studies involving adaptive training exercises on computer he has successfully designed methods to improve their temporal processing skills these adaptive measures include wordprocessing games and comprehension tests that involve multiple regions of the brain in order to answer the results later translated into his development of the fast forword program in 1996 which aims to enhance cognitive skills of children between kindergarten and twelfth grade by focusing on developing phonological awareness  it has proven very successful at helping children with a variety of cognitive complications in addition it has led to in depth studies of specific complications such as autism and intellectual disability and the causes of them  alongside a team of scientists merzenich helped to provide evidence that autism probes monochannel perception where a stronger stimulusdriven representation dominates behavior and weaker stimuli are practically ignored in comparison neurons are the basic functional unit of the brain and process and transmit information through signals many different types of neurons exist such as sensory neurons motor neurons inter neurons and sound neurons each respond to specific stimuli and send respective and appropriate chemical signals to other regions to distribute the information the basic structure of a neuron is shown here on the right and consists of a nucleus that contains genetic information the cell body or the soma that has dendritic branches that receive information a long thin axon that extends to the axon terminal and an axon terminal where branching dendrites send information  the dendrites give and receive information through a small gap called a synapse this component of the neuron contains a variety of chemical messengers and proteins that allow for the transmission of information it is the variety of proteins and affect of the signal that fundamentally lead to the plasticity feature nearly every cortex and region within the brain is involved in its plasticity feature since most regions are capable of adopting other regions functions based on relative use and the rewiring of the topographic map the reorganization of sensory and motor maps involves a variety of pathways and cellular structures related to relative activity more important than structures and regions are the subunits involved in these changes ampa and nmda receptors are capable of altering long and shortterm potentiation between neurons nmda receptors can detect local activity due to activation and therefore modify signaling in the postsynaptic cell the increased activity and coordination between pre and postsynaptic receptors leads to more permanent changes and therefore result in changes in plasticity hebbs postulate addresses this fact by stating that synaptic terminals are strengthened by correlated activity and will therefore sprout new branches however terminals that experience weakened and minimal activity will eventually lose their synaptic connection and deteriorate  a major target of all molecular signaling is the inhibitory connections made by gabaergic neurons these receptors exist at postsynaptic sites and along with the regulation of local inhibitory synapses have been found to be very sensitive to critical period alterations any alteration to the receptors leads to changed concentrations of calcium in the affected cells and can ultimately influence dendritic and axonal branching  this concentration change is the result of many kinases being activated the byproduct of which may enhance specific gene expression in addition it has been identified that the wg postsynaptic pathway which is responsible for the coding and production of many molecules for development events can be bidirectionally stimulated and is responsible for the downstream alteration of the postsynaptic neuron when the wg presynaptic pathway is activated however it alters cytoskeletal structure through transcription and translation  cell adhesion molecules cams are also important in plasticity as they help coordinate the signaling across the synapse more specifically integrins which are receptors for extracellular matrix proteins and involved with cams are explicitly incorporated in synapse maturation and memory formation they play a crucial role in the feedback regulation of excitatory synaptic strength or longterm potentiation ltp and help to control synaptic strength by regulating ampa receptors which result in quick short synaptic currents  but it is the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 mglu1 that has been discovered to be required for activitydependent synaptic plasticity in associative learning  activitydependent plasticity is even seen in the primary visual cortex a region of the brain that processes visual stimuli and is capable of modifying the experienced stimuli based on active sensing and arousal states it is known that synaptic communication trends between excited and depressed states relative to the lightdark cycle by experimentation on long evans rats it was found that visual experience during vigilant states leads to increased responsiveness and plastic changes in the visual cortex  more so depressed states were found to negatively alter the stimulus so the reaction was not as energetic this experiment proves that even the visual cortex is capable of achieving activitydependent plasticity as it is reliant on both visual exploration and the arousal state of the animal activitydependent plasticity plays a very large role in learning and in the ability of understanding new things it is responsible for helping to adapt an individuals brain according to the relative amount of usage and functioning in essence it is the brains ability to retain and develop memories based on activitydriven changes of synaptic strength that allow stronger learning of information it is thought to be the growing and adapting quality of dendritic spines that provide the basis for synaptic plasticity connected to learning and memory  dendritic spines accomplish this by transforming synaptic input into neuronal output and also by helping to define the relationship between synapses in recent studies a specific gene has also been identified as having a strong role in synapse growth and activitydependent plasticity the microrna 132 gene mir132  this gene is regulated by the camp response elementbinding creb protein pathway and is capable of enhancing dendritic growth when activated the mir132 gene is another component that is responsible for the brains plasticity and helps to establish stronger connections between neurons another plasticityrelated gene involved in learning and memory is arcarg31 the arc gene is activityregulated  and the transcribed mrna is localized to activated synaptic sites   where the translated protein plays a role in ampa receptor trafficking  arc is a member of a class of proteins called immediate early genes that are rapidly transcribed in response to synaptic input of the estimated 3040 genes that comprise the total neuronal ieg response all are prototypical activitydependent genes and a number have been implicated in learning and memory for example zif268 arc betaactivin tpa homer and cox2 have all been implicated in longterm potentiation ltp  a cellular correlate of learning and memory there are a variety of mechanisms in place and being discovered from activitydependent plasticity that work together to help the brain overcome problems and better adapt to functions these include ltp longterm depression ltd synaptic elimination neurogenesis and synaptogenesis  the mechanisms of activitydependent plasticity result in membrane depolarization and calcium influx which in turn trigger cellular changes that affect synaptic connections and gene transcription in essence neuronal activity helps to regulate gene expression for dendritic branching and synapse development while mutations in activitydependent transcriptionrelated genes can lead to neurological disorders each of the studies findings aims to help proper development of the brain while improving a wide variety of tasks such as speech movement comprehension and memory more so the findings better explain the development induced by plasticity it is known that during postnatal life a critical step to nervous system development is synapse elimination the changes in synaptic connections and strength are results from ltp and ltd and are strongly regulated by the release of brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf an activitydependent synapsedevelopment protein   in addition to bdnf nogo66 receptors and more specifically ngr1 are also involved in the development and regulation of neuronal structure  damage to this receptor leads to pointless ltp and attenuation of ltd both situations imply that ngr1 is a regulator of synaptic plasticity from experiments it has been found that stimulation inducing ltd leads to a reduction in synaptic strength and loss of connections but when coupled simultaneously with lowfrequency stimulation helps the restructuring of synaptic contacts the implications of this finding include helping people with receptor damage and providing insight into the mechanism behind ltp another mechanism that gives rise to activitydependent plasticity includes the excitatory corticostriatal pathway that allows for the storage of adaptive motor behaviors this pathway is also capable of adhering to longlasting synaptic changes the change in synaptic strength is responsible for motor learning and is dependent on the simultaneous activation of glutamatergic corticostriatal and dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathways these are the very pathways that are affected in parkinsons disease and the degeneration of synapses within this disorder may be responsible for the loss of cognitive abilities  therefore the impairment of daachdependent learning can lead to the storage of inessential memories since plasticity is such a functional and necessary component of the brain its proper functioning is necessary for healthy living since it accounts for brain constructionrepair and storage mutations within any of the genes associated with activitydependent plasticity have been found to positively correlate with various degrees of intellectual disability  the two types of intellectual disability related to plasticity depend on dysfunctional neuronal development or alterations in molecular mechanisms involved in synaptic organization complications within either of these types can greatly reduce brain function and more importantly brain capability and comprehension on the other hand people with such conditions have the capacity to recover some degree of their lost abilities through continued challenges and use a great example of this can be seen within norman doidges the brain that changes itself bach y ritas father suffered from a disabling stroke that left the 65yearold man halfparalyzed and unable to speak after one year of crawling and unusual therapy tactics including playing basic childrens games and washing pots his fathers rehabilitation was nearly complete and he went back to his role as a professor at city college in new york  the remarkable recovery from a stroke proves that even someone with abnormal behavior and severe medical complications can recover nearly all of the normal functions by much practice and perseverance thus the message behind activitydependent plasticity recent studies have reported that a specific gene fmr1 is highly involved in activitydependent plasticity and fragile x syndrome frax is the result of this genes loss of function fmr1 produces fmrp which mediates activitydependent control of synaptic structure the loss or absence of this gene almost certainly leads to both autism and intellectual disability dr gatto has found that early introduction of the product fmrp results in nearly complete restructuring of the synapses this method is not as effective though when introduced into a mature subject and only partially accommodates for the losses of fmr1  the discovery of this gene provides a possible location for intervention for young children with these abnormalities as this gene and its product act early to construct synaptic architecture a common issue amongst most people in the united states is high levels of stress and also disorders associated with continuous stress many regions of the brain are very sensitive to stress and can be damaged with extended exposure more importantly many of the mechanisms involved with increased memory retention comprehension and adaptation is the result of ltp and ltd two activitydependent plasticity mechanisms that stress can directly suppress several experiments have been conducted in order to discover the specific mechanisms for this suppression and also possible intervention methods dr li and several others have actually identified the trpv1 channel as a target to facilitate ltp and suppress ltd therefore helping to protect the feature of synaptic plasticity and retention of memory from the effects of stress  the future studies and questions for activitydependent plasticity are nearly endless because the implications of the findings will enable many treatments despite many gains within the field there are a wide variety of disorders that further understanding would help treat and perhaps cure these include autism different severities of intellectual disability schizophrenia parkinsons disease stress and stroke victims in addition to a better understanding of the various disorders neurologists should and will look at the plasticity incurred by the immune system as it will provide great insight into diseases and also give the basis of new immunecentered therapeutics  a better perspective of the cellular mechanisms that regulate neuronal morphology is the next step to discovering new treatments for learning and memory pathological conditions

V in vertebrates the gallbladder also gall bladder biliary vesicle or cholecyst is a small organ where bile a fluid produced by the liver is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine humans can live without a gallbladder the surgical removal of the gallbladder is called a cholecystectomy   the gallbladder is a hollow organ that sits just beneath the right lobe of the liver  in adults the gallbladder measures approximately 8 centimetres 31in in length and 4 centimetres 16in in diameter when fully distended  the gallbladder has a capacity of about 100ml   the gallbladder is shaped like a tapered sac with the open end opening into the biliary tree and the cystic duct anatomically the gallbladder is divided into three sections the fundus body and neck  the fundus is a rounded end that faces the front of the body  the body is in contact with the liver lying in the gallbladder fossa a depression at the bottom of the liver  the neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct part of the biliary tree the cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct at the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct there is an outpouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as hartmanns pouch where gallstones commonly get stuck the angle of the gallbladder is located between the costal margin and the lateral margin of the rectus abdominis muscle the fundus is at the same level as the transpyloric plane parts of the gall bladder the gallbladder connects to the liver via the cystic duct gross anatomy and local ducts connecting to the liver pancreas and duodenum of the small intestine the layers of the gallbladder wall are visible under the microscope the gallbladder walls innermost surface is lined by a single layer of columnar cells with an apical brush border of microvilli very similar to intestinal absorptive cells   underneath the epithelia is an underlying lamina propria a muscular layer an outer perimuscular layer and serosa unlike elsewhere in the intestinal tract the gallbladder does not have a muscularis mucosae and the muscular fibres are not arranged in distinct layers  in greater detail the layers are   the gallbladder develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube  early in development the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac during the second week of embryogenesis as the embryo grows it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac the enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract such as the oesophagus stomach and intestines  during the fourth week of embryological development the stomach rotates the stomach originally lying in the midline of the embryo rotates so that its body is on the left this rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach which will go on to become the duodenum by the end of the fourth week the developing duodenum begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side the hepatic diverticulum which will go on to become the biliary tree just below this is a second outpouching known as the cystic diverticulum that will eventually develop into the gallbladder  anatomical variants of the gallbladder occur very rarely although a range of abnormalities have been documented the number and structure of the gallbladder may vary occasionally two or even three gallbladders may coexist either as separate bladders draining into the cystic duct or sharing a common branch that drains into the cystic duct additionally the gallbladder may fail to form at all gallbladders with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist these abnormalities are not likely to affect function and are generally asymptomatic  the location of the gallbladder in relation to the liver may also vary with documented variants including gallbladders found within  above on the left side of behind and detached from the liver such variants are very rare from 1886 to 1998 only 110 cases of leftlying liver or less than one per year were reported in scientific literature   an anatomical variation can occur known as a phrygian cap which is an innocuous fold in the fundus named after its resemblance to the phrygian cap  the main purpose of the gallbladder is to store bile also called gall needed for the digestion of food the gallbladder is part of the biliary system and serves as a reservoir for bile which is produced by the liver the liver produces the bile and then it flows through the hepatic ducts into the gallbladder at any one time 30 to 60 millilitres 10 to 20usfloz of bile is stored within the gallbladder  when food containing fat enters the digestive tract it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin cck from i cells of the duodenum and jejunum in response to cholecystokinin the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct eventually draining into the duodenum the bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food thereby assisting their absorption bile consists primarily of water and bile salts and also acts as a means of eliminating bilirubin a product of hemoglobin metabolism from the body  the bile that is secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder is not the same as the bile that is secreted by the gallbladder during gallbladder storage of bile it is concentrated by removal of some water and electrolytes this is through the active transport of sodium ions across the epithelia of the gallbladder which creates an osmotic pressure that also causes water and other electrolytes such as chloride to be reabsorbed  gallstones are the most common problem to affect the gallbladder  gallstones generally form when the bile is saturated with either cholesterol or bilirubin only a minority of gallstones cause symptoms most stones are passed along the biliary system when symptoms occur severe pain in the upper right part of the abdomen is felt if the stone blocks the gallbladder inflammation as cholecystitis may result if the stone lodges in the biliary system jaundice may occur and if the stone blocks the pancreatic duct then pancreatitis may occur gallstones are often managed by waiting for them to be naturally passed in people with recurrent gallstones surgery to remove the gallbladder may be considered some medication such as ursodeoxycholic acid may be used and lithotripsy a procedure used to break down the stones may also be used  inflammation of the gallbladder is known as cholecystitis inflammation is most commonly because of obstruction of the duct with gallstones known as cholelithiasis blocked bile accumulates and pressure on the gallbladder wall may lead to the release of substances that cause inflammation such as phospholipase there is also the risk of bacterial infection an inflamed gallbladder is likely to cause pain and fever and tenderness in the upper right corner of the abdomen and may have a positive murphys sign cholecystitis is often managed with rest and antibiotics particularly cephalosporins and in severe cases metronidazole  cholecystitis may also occur chronically particularly when a person is prone to getting gallstones  cholesterolosis of the gallbladder also called strawberry gallbladder is a change in the gallbladder wall due to excess cholesterol  it is not linked to gallstones or inflammation gallbladder polyps are mostly benign growths or lesions resembling growths that form in the gallbladder wall  a cholecystectomy is a procedure in which the gallbladder is removed it may be removed because of recurrent gallstones and is considered an elective procedure a cholecystectomy may be an open procedure or one conducted by laparoscopy in the surgery the gallbladder is removed from the neck to the fundus  and so bile will drain directly from the liver into the biliary tree about 30 of patients may experience some degree of indigestion following the procedure although severe complications are much rarer  a cholescintigraphy scan is a nuclear imaging procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder numerous words in the english language relate to the gallbladder and the bile that it stores to have gall is associated with bold behaviour whereas to have bile is associated with bitterness  in the chinese language the gallbladder chinese \u81bd is associated with

V the ampulla of vater also known as the hepatopancreatic ampullaor as hepatopancreatic duct is formed by the union of the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct the ampulla is specifically located at the major duodenal papilla the ampulla of vater is an important landmark halfway along the second part of the duodenum that marks the anatomical transition from foregut to midgut and hence the point where the celiac trunk stops supplying the gut and the superior mesenteric artery takes over   hepatopancreatic anatomy the cystic duct leaves the gallbladder and joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct this duct subsequently joins with the pancreatic duct this junction is known as the ampulla of vater the pancreatic duct delivers substances such as bicarbonate and digestive enzymes to the duodenum the bile from the gallbladder contains salts which emulsify large fat droplets into much smaller units this provides a large surface area for the lipase enzymes to act on the bicarbonate neutralises the acidic chyme creating alkaline conditions for enzymes such as chymotrypsin and amylase to work best at these ph levels various smooth muscle sphincters regulate the flow of bile and pancreatic juice through the ampulla the sphincter of the pancreatic duct the sphincter of the bile duct and the sphincter of oddi the sphincter of oddi controls the introduction of bile and pancreatic secretions into the duodenum as well as preventing the entry of duodenal contents into the ampulla pancreatitis can result from a failure of pancreatic secretions to drain properly one possible cause of impaired drainage of pancreatic juice is blockage of the sphincter of oddi a common cause of blockage is a gallstone in the common bile duct the eponymical term ampulla of vater is named after abraham vater 16841751 a german anatomist who first published a description of it in 1720  the pancreatic duct carcinoma of ampulla

V a gill  \u0261\u026al is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide the gills of some species such as hermit crabs have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist the microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment many microscopic aquatic animals and some larger but inactive ones can absorb adequate oxygen through the entire surface of their bodies and so can respire adequately without a gill however more complex or more active aquatic organisms usually require a gill or gills  gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue branches or slender tufted processes that have a highly folded surface to increase surface area a high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only a small fraction of the dissolved oxygen that air does a cubic meter of air contains about 250 grams of oxygen at stp the concentration of oxygen in water is lower than air and it diffuses more slowly in fresh water the dissolved oxygen content is approximately 8cm l compared to that of air which is 210cm l  water is 777 times more dense than air and is 100 times more viscous  oxygen has a diffusion rate in air 10000 times greater than in water  the use of saclike lungs to remove oxygen from water would not be efficient enough to sustain life  rather than using lungs gasesous exchange takes place across the surface of highly vascularised gills over which a oneway current of water is kept flowing by a specialised pumping mechanism the density of the water prevents the gills from collapsing and lying on top of each other which is what happens when a fish is taken out of water  with the exception of some aquatic insects the filaments and lamellae folds contain blood or coelomic fluid from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls the blood carries oxygen to other parts of the body carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water gills or gilllike organs located in different parts of the body are found in various groups of aquatic animals including mollusks crustaceans insects fish and amphibians   the gills of vertebrates typically develop in the walls of the pharynx along a series of gill slits opening to the exterior most species employ a countercurrent exchange system to enhance the diffusion of substances in and out of the gill with blood and water flowing in opposite directions to each other the gills are composed of comblike filaments the gill lamellae which help increase their surface area for oxygen exchange  when a fish breathes it draws in a mouthful of water at regular intervals then it draws the sides of its throat together forcing the water through the gill openings so it passes over the gills to the outside fish gill slits may be the evolutionary ancestors of the tonsils thymus glands and eustachian tubes as well as many other structures derived from the embryonic branchial pouches  sharks and rays typically have five pairs of gill slits that open directly to the outside of the body though some more primitive sharks have six pairs adjacent slits are separated by a cartilaginous gill arch from which projects a cartilaginous gill ray this gill ray is the support for the sheetlike interbranchial septum which the individual lamellae of the gills lie on either side of the base of the arch may also support gill rakers projections into the pharyngeal cavity that help to prevent large pieces of debris from damaging the delicate gills  a smaller opening the spiracle lies in the back of the first gill slit this bears a small pseudobranch that resembles a gill in structure but only receives blood already oxygenated by the true gills  the spiracle is thought to be homologous to the ear opening in higher vertebrates  most sharks rely on ram ventilation forcing water into the mouth and over the gills by rapidly swimming forward in slowmoving or bottomdwelling species especially among skates and rays the spiracle may be enlarged and the fish breathes by sucking water through this opening instead of through the mouth  chimaeras differ from other cartilagenous fish having lost both the spiracle and the fifth gill slit the remaining slits are covered by an operculum developed from the septum of the gill arch in front of the first gill  in bony fish the gills lie in a branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum the great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills although a few have lost some over the course of evolution the operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills so bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation and hence near constant motion to breathe valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping  the gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum so the gills alone project from the arch supported by individual gill rays some species retain gill rakers though all but the most primitive bony fish lack spiracles the pseudobranch associated with them often remains being located at the base of the operculum this is however often greatly reduced consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gilllike structure  marine teleosts also use gills to excrete electrolytes the gills large surface area tends to create a problem for fish that seek to regulate the osmolarity of their internal fluids salt water is less dilute than these internal fluids so saltwater fish lose large quantities of water osmotically through their gills to regain the water they drink large amounts of sea water and excrete the salt fresh water is more dilute than the internal fluids of fish however so freshwater fish gain water osmotically through their gills  lampreys and hagfish do not have gill slits as such instead the gills are contained in spherical pouches with a circular opening to the outside like the gill slits of higher fish each pouch contains two gills in some cases the openings may be fused together effectively forming an operculum lampreys have seven pairs of pouches while hagfishes may have six to fourteen depending on the species in the hagfish the pouches connect with the pharynx internally and a separate tube which has no respiratory tissue the pharyngocutaneous duct develops beneath the pharynx proper expelling ingested debris by closing a valve at its anterior end  tadpoles of amphibians have from three to five gill slits that do not contain actual gills usually no spiracle or true operculum is present though many species have operculumlike structures instead of internal gills they develop three feathery external gills that grow from the outer surface of the gill arches sometimes adults retain these but they usually disappear at metamorphosis lungfish larvae also have external gills as does the primitive rayfinned fish polypterus though the latter has a structure different from amphibians  some salamanders such as the olm and the mudpuppy retain their external gills upon reaching adulthood branchia pl branchiae is the naturalists name for gills galen observed that fish had multitudes of openings foramina big enough to admit gases but too fine to give passage to water pliny the elder held that fish respired by their gills but observed that aristotle was of another opinion  the word branchia comes from the greek \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1 gills plural of \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd in singular meaning a fin  respiration in the echinodermata includes starfish and sea urchins is carried out using a very primitive version of gills called papulae these thin protuberances on the surface of the body contain diverticula of the water vascular system crustaceans molluscs and some aquatic insects have tufted gills or platelike structures on the surfaces of their bodies the gills of aquatic insects are tracheal but the air tubes are sealed commonly connected to thin external plates or tufted structures that allow diffusion the oxygen in these tubes is renewed through the gills in the larval dragon fly the wall of the caudal end of the alimentary tract rectum is richly supplied with tracheae as a rectal gill and water pumped into and out of the rectum provides oxygen to the closed tracheae a plastron is a type of structural adaptation occurring among some aquatic arthropods primarily insects a form of physical gill which holds a thin film of atmospheric oxygen in an area with small openings called spiracles that connect to the tracheal system the plastron typically consists of dense patches of hydrophobic setae on the body which prevent water entry into the spiracles but may also involve scales or microscopic ridges projecting from the cuticle the physical properties of the interface between the trapped air film and surrounding water allow gas exchange through the spiracles almost as if the insect were in atmospheric air carbon dioxide diffuses into the surrounding water due to its high solubility while oxygen diffuses into the film as the concentration within the film has been reduced by respiration and nitrogen also diffuses out as its tension has been increased oxygen diffuses into the air film at a higher rate than nitrogen diffuses out however water surrounding the insect can become oxygendepleted if there is no water movement so many such insects in still water actively direct a flow of water over their bodies the physical gill mechanism allows aquatic insects with plastrons to remain constantly submerged examples include many beetles in the family elmidae aquatic weevils and true bugs in the family aphelocheiridae as well as at least one species of ricinuleid arachnid  a somewhat similar mechanism is used by the diving bell spider which maintains an underwater bubble that exchanges gas like a plastron other diving insects such as backswimmers and hydrophilid beetles may carry trapped air bubbles but deplete the oxygen more quickly and thus need constant replenishment

V décolletage d\u026a\u02c8k\u0252l\u0259t\u0251\u02d0\u0292 or décolleté its adjectival form in current french is the upper part of a womans torso comprising her neck shoulders back and chest that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing however the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage lowcut necklines are a feature of ball gowns evening gowns leotards lingerie and swimsuits among other fashions although décolletage does not itself prescribe the extent of exposure of a womans upper chest the design of a décolleté garment takes into account current fashions aesthetics social norms and the occasion when a garment will be worn though neckline styles have varied in western societies and décolletage may be regarded as aesthetic and an expression of femininity in some parts of the world any décolletage is considered provocative and shocking   décolletage is a french word which is derived from décolleter meaning to reveal the neck  the term was first used in english literature sometime before 1831  in strict usage décolletage is the neckline extending about two handbreadths from the base of the neck down front and back  in indonesia especially in java a breast cloth known as kemben was worn for centuries until the 20th century today shoulderexposing gowns still feature in many indonesian rituals gowns which exposed a womans neck and top of her chest were very common and noncontroversial in europe from at least the 11th century until the victorian period in the 19th century ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage   during that long period lowcut dresses partially exposing breasts were considered more acceptable than they are today a womans bared legs ankles or shoulders were considered more risqué than exposed breasts  in 1450 agnès sorel mistress to charles vii of france is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the french court  other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included simonetta vespucci whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by piero di cosimo in c1480 during the 16th century womens fashions with exposed breasts were common in society from queens to common prostitutes and emulated by all classes  anne of brittany has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline low square décolleté styles were popular in england in the 17th century and even queen mary ii and henrietta maria wife of charles i of england were depicted with fully bared breasts and architect inigo jones designed a masque costume for henrietta maria that fully revealed both of her breasts   in aristocratic and upperclass circles the display of breasts was at times regarded as a status symbol as a sign of beauty wealth or social position  from the renaissance onwards the bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of classical greece that were exerting an influence on art sculpture and architecture of the period  after the french revolution décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back  during the fashions of the period 17951820 many women wore dresses which bared the bosom and shoulders during the victorian period social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public for ordinary wear high collars were the norm towards the end of the victorian period end 19th century the full collar was the fashion though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions see 1880s in fashion in 1884 a portrait painting by john singer sargent of americanborn paris socialite virginie amélie avegno gautreau was criticised  when she was depicted in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder the controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder and sargent left paris for london in 1884 his reputation in tatters the painting was named portrait of madame x   when it became fashionable around 1913 for dresses to be worn with what would now be considered a relatively modest round or vshaped neckline clergymen all over the world became deeply shocked in the german empire all of the roman catholic bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking modern fashions  fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage while exposure of the leg became more permitted in western societies during world war i and remained so for nearly half a century  in 1953 hollywood film the french line was found objectionable under the strict hays code with some of jane russells décolletage gowns being described as intentionally designed to give a bosom peepshow effect beyond even extreme décolletage  but other actresses defied the then standards for example gina lollobrigida raised eyebrows with her famous lowcut dress in 1960 and other celebrities performers and models followed suit and the public was not far behind lowcut styles of various depths are now common in many situations during a short period in 1964 topless dress designs appeared at fashion shows but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges  low necklines usually result in increased décolletage in western and some other societies there are differences of opinion as to how much body and especially breast exposure is acceptable in public  what is considered the appropriate neckline varies by context and is open to differences of opinion in the united states in two separate incidents in 2007 southwest airlines crews asked travelers to modify their clothing to wear sweaters or to leave the plane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable  german chancellor angela merkel created controversy when she wore a lowcut evening gown to the opening of the oslo opera house in 2008

V the fractional excretion of sodium fena is the percentage of the sodium filtered by the kidney which is excreted in the urine it is measured in terms of plasma and urine sodium rather than by the interpretation of urinary sodium concentration alone as urinary sodium concentrations can vary with water reabsorption therefore the urinary and plasma concentrations of sodium must be compared to get an accurate picture of renal clearance in clinical use the fractional excretion of sodium can be calculated as part of the evaluation of acute kidney failure in order to determine if hypovolemia or decreased effective circulating plasma volume is a contributor to the kidney failure   fena is calculated in two partsfiguring out how much sodium is excreted in the urine and then finding its ratio to the total amount of sodium that passed through aka filtered by the kidney first the actual amount of sodium excreted is calculated by multiplying the urine sodium concentration by the urinary flow rate this is the numerator in the equation the denominator is the total amount of sodium filtered by the kidneys this is calculated by multiplying the plasma sodium concentration by the glomerular filtration rate calculated using creatinine filtration this formula is represented mathematically as sodiumurinary  flow rateurinary  sodiumplasma x creatinineurinary  flow rateurinary  creatinineplasma  100 sodium mmoll creatinine mgdl the flow rates cancel out in the above equation simplifying to the standard equation   for ease of recall one can just remember the fractional excretion of sodium is the clearance of sodium divided by the glomerular filtration rate ie the fraction excreted fena can be useful in the evaluation of acute kidney failure and low urine output low fractional excretion indicate sodium retention by the kidney suggesting pathophysiology extrinsic to the urinary system such as volume depletion or decrease in effective circulating volume eg low output heart failure higher values can suggest sodium wasting due to acute tubular necrosis or other causes of intrinsic kidney failure the fena may be affected or invalidated by diuretic use since many diuretics act by altering the kidneys handling of sodium while the above values are useful for older children and adults the fena must be interpreted more cautiously in younger pediatric patients due to the limited ability of immature tubules to reabsorb sodium maximally thus in term neonates a fena of 3 represents volume depletion and a fena as high as 4 may represent maximal sodium conservation in critically ill preterm neonates   the fena may also be spuriously elevated in children with adrenal insufficiency or preexisting kidney disease such as obstructive uropathy due to salt wasting  the fena is generally less than 1 in patients with hepatorenal syndrome and acute glomerulonephropathy although often reliable at discriminating between prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis the fena has been reported to be 1 occasionally with oliguric and nonoliguric acute tubular necrosis urinary tract obstruction acute glomerulonephritis renal allograft rejection sepsis and drugrelated alterations in renal hemodynamics  therefore the utility of the test is best when used in conjunction with other clinical data fractional excretion of other substances can be measured to determine renal clearance including urea uric acid and lithium these can be used in patients undergoing diuretic therapy since diuretics induce a natriuresis thus the urinary sodium concentration and fena may be higher in patients receiving diuretics in spite of prerenal pathology  body water intracellular fluidcytosol

V the assessment of regional function of the heart is a powerful tool for the detection of deterioration of a certain parts of the heart wall early on and before it diffuses further one of the most accurate measures of changes in regional function is the use of strain as a practical sensitive and accurate measure of regional function of cardiac muscle   one of the most important indicators of heart problems is described as weakening of the cardiac function this means that the hearts ability to pump blood to the body is diminished before this becomes a problem for other organs of the body it is beneficial to detect early progress of the disease in the heart wall muscle itself this can be detected when the proper device is used as weakening of the contractility of some part of the heart muscle hence it is described as change in regional function it is important to note that the weakening of regional function does not always lead to weakening in overall cardiac function this will depend on a number of factors including the degree of regional weakening and its extent inside the wall the myocytes of the heart also called the myocardial fibers are arranged in a general circumferential direction in the ventricles in the lv the fibers will change gradually in direction from a certain longitudinalcirumferential direction in the outer layer of the heart epicardium to another angulated direction almost orthogonal in the inner wall endocardium becoming overwhelmingly circumferential somewhere halfway in the middle of the wall it is therefore perceived that measuring the strain in the circumferential direction is a good indicator of the contractility of the fibers there are different ways to measure the regional function of the wall it has been proposed to measure the speed of the lv wall motion the thickening of the wall or other changes in the shape of small regions of the wall as it contracts and relaxes the latter is best measured using the mechanical quantity called strain strain can be described as the percentile change in spacing between two points on a deforming object here are some important points about strain because strain is measured between two points that strain therefore describes the change in distance along the direction connecting the two points if we think of a rubber band that is stretched the strain along the band will have a positive value for stretching ie when selecting two points placed along the band length at the same time the band width will decrease resulting in a negative strain orthogonal to the bands length in the case of the heart it has become conventional to use certain directions for measuring strain this is the strain measured along the thickness of the wall in fact it measures the wall thickening in a normal heart the radial strain is positive as measured from enddiastole for the lv and rv it is the strain that measured the shortening or relaxation of the wall muscle from the base of the ventricles to the apex in a normal heart the longitudinal strain is negative as measured from enddiastole this is the third strain component whose direction is orthogonal to both the radial and longitudinal one way to see it is the reduction of the circumference of the lv chamber as seen in a shortaxis view the annular shape of the lv wall will change and become thicker radial strain with a smaller inner circle circumferential strain in a normal heart the circumferential strain is negative as measured from enddiastole note that peak contraction this is the point of time when the rubber ban is smallest in case of the lv of the heart it can be identified as endsystole however end systole describes a global change in the chamber which is the sum of the contraction of the regions because of the different timing of activation of the wall region and other factors the end systole does not coincide exactly with the peak contractions of the regions in a normal heart these times should be close enough for efficient pumping by the heart but they are not exactly the same when the variance in time exceeds a certain degree the heart becomes more dyssynchronous peak stretching similar to peak contraction peak stretching is the instant when the rubber band is at its maximum length in the case of the lv it will correspond with enddiastole and with the same comment about the variance like endsystole of the three strain components circumferential strain is perhaps the most widely used to measure regional function it can be used to measure subclinical changes in function this can be determined by 1 measuring the absolute strain and determine if it is lower than certain lower limit 2 measuring the change in segmental or global strain and see if the change exceed 1015 relative change because the general direction of the fibers in the ventricles is circumferential the strain in that direction is a good representation of the innate contractility of the wall muscle note that the exact contractility determination cannot solely be deduced from strain as the after load needs to be decoupled using mri tagging and harp circumferential strain is reliably measured not only it is easy to measure using mri but it is done so with high accuracy as is demonstrated by many bodies of research over the last decade strain can be measured by various medical imaging modalities of special interest is using echocardiography of magnetic resonance imaging mri in echocardiography strain can be measured by using tissue doppler imaging tdi or speckle tracking echocardiography ste using mri strain and deformation can be measured noninvasively using mri tagging and harmonic phase analysis harp  strain encoding senc or tissue tracking the latter is similar to ste although the mri images do not show significant heterogeneity within the tissue to track one of the applications is using peak circumferential strain to the viability of the myocardium   the figure shows this relation as well as converting the strain value into the typical qualitative assessment as normal hypkinetic akinetic and dyskinetic for the wall motion

V the modality effect is a term used in experimental psychology most often in the fields dealing with memory and learning to refer to how learner performance depends on the presentation mode of studied items   modality can refer to a number of characteristics of the presented study material however this term is usually used to describe the improved recall of the final items of a list when that list is presented verbally in comparison with a visual representation the effect is seen in free recall recall of list items in any given order serial recall recall of list items in the order of study shortterm sentence recall recall specific words from sentences with similar meanings and paired associate recall recall of a pair from presentation of one of its members for paired associates the effect is limited to an increased probability of recall for the final 2 or 3 pairs studied  in free recall and serial recall the modality effect is seen as simply an exaggerated recency effect in tests where presentation is auditory in shortterm sentence recall studies emphasis is placed on words in a distractorword list when requesting information from the remembered sentence this demonstrates the modality effect can be more than auditory or visual  for serial recall the modality effect is seen in an increased memory span for auditorally presented lists memory span is defined as the maximum number of items that participants correctly recall in 50 of trials typically studies find these to be seven digits six letters and five words  in a study done by drewnowski and murdock a visual list of english words was found to have an immediate recall of 482 words while an auditory representation of this same list led to a memory span of 536 a statistically significant variance  some studies use the term modality to refer to a general difference in performance based upon the mode of presentation for example gibbons demonstrated modality effects in an experiment by making participants count either beeping sounds or visually presented dots the toberemembered number was derived from the number of dots or beeps counted  in memory experiments the modality effect is an example of source clustering which refers to the tendency of items presented in the same modality to be grouped together during recall  withinlist manipulations of modality affect recall probability order of recall and grouping  bennet murdock used a basic free recall paradigm with different types of lists mixing auditorally and visually presented words the results he obtained showed that modality improved recency but did not affect recall for the prerecency items this effect was seen to be slightly larger when the items for study were presented more rapidly  however with mixed list presentations lists presented both auditorally and visually in a single study period the superiority of auditory study is seen in all serial positions not just in recency murdock interprets this as evidence for separate short term stores for visual and auditory memory glenberg  showed that the modality effect is also prevalent in long term memory showing that toberemembered word pairs that are separated by distractor activity are better recalled if presented auditorally vs visually by using techniques similar to murdocks free recall paradigm plus the addition of varied amounts of distraction time filled with counting backwards glenberg showed that the modality effect is not affected by a disruptive task and therefore is theoretically not restricted to short term memory several terms have been used to refer to the modality effect on recency crowder and morton  refer to it as pas or precategorical acoustic store this and other similar termsechoic memory phonological loop are used to explain a specialized shortterm memory system store for phonological information

V an auditory brainstem implant abi is a surgically implanted electronic device that provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf due to retrocochlear hearing impairment due to illness or injury damaging the cochlea or auditory nerve and so precluding the use of a cochlear implant the auditory brainstem implant uses technology similar to that of the cochlear implant but instead of electrical stimulation being used to stimulate the cochlea it is used to stimulate the brainstem of the recipient only about one thousand five hundred recipients have been implanted with an auditory brainstem implant due to the nature of the surgery required to implant the device as it requires brain surgery to implant the device in the united states abis were previously only approved for adults 18  over and only for patients with neurofibromatosis type ii nf2 in january 2013 the us fda approved a clinical trial of auditory brainstem implants for children  in europe abis have been used in children and adults and in patients with nf2  as well as other auditory complications such as auditory nerve aplasia and cochlea ossification  the abi was originally developed at the house ear institute in 1979 for nf2 patients who lost their viiin function bilaterally following surgery to remove vestibular schwannomas vs     the abi has provided therapeutic benefit for nf2 patients in terms of sound awareness identification of some environmental sounds and improved performance over lipreading alone when communicating facetoface      however speech understanding without visual cues commonly called openset speech recognition was generally poor recently colletti and colleagues observed high levels of open set speech recognition without visual cues in abi patients who had lost their viiin from causes other than nf2 many of these nontumor abi patients were able to achieve better than 50 recognition of sentences presented in quiet and could even achieve conversational use of the telephone   this result suggested that the abi device and electrode placement in the lateral recess of the iv ventricle was capable of providing good speech recognition the limited speech understanding observed in nf2 abi patients was thus thought to be due to negative factors related to nf2 however new results in nf2 abi patients have also showed excellent speech recognition   suggesting that the cause of improved speech understanding was not related to nf2 alone prior to surgery some nf2 patients have normal hearing and speech recognition in the tumor ear even with a large tumor suggesting that the presence of the tumor itself does not necessarily cause an auditory deficit the loss of hearing and speech recognition in most nf2 patients may be due to the tumor interfering with the blood supply to the cochlea viiin andor cochlear nucleus in addition physical compression by the tumor of the nerve and brainstem might impair neural excitability the recently observed improvement in nf2 abi speech recognition may be due to differences in patient etiology surgical technique damage to the brainstem before and during tumor removal or electrode placement device design signal processing or other factors   the auditory brainstem electrodes were first implanted in humans in 1979 at the house ear institute ca usa   this original abi consisted of two ball electrodes which were implanted near the surface of the cochlear nucleus a change from a percutaneous connection to a wireless transcutaneous connection and from ball electrodes to flat electrodes were the only changes to the implant until 1991 where 25 people had received the abi  in the us in 1992 an eight electrode implant was developed by cochlear limited the house ear institute and huntington medical research institute  an electrode array with 21 electrodes developed by cochlear limited was developed for the european market at the same time  the processor for both the eight and 20 electrode implants used nucleus 22 abi cochlear limited external speech processors since 1999 a 21 electrode array implant has been used with the nucleus 24 abi cochlear limited speech processor a 12 electrode array implant with a speech processor based on the c40 cochlear implant medel  the first combi 40 abi implantation was performed in 1997 by prof behr at the university of wurzburg germany the device reached its ce mark in 2003 a 16 electrode array implant with the clarion12 cochlear implant advanced bionics  have also been developed

V the tongue is a muscular hydrostat on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates that manipulates food for mastication it is the primary organ of taste gustation as much of its upper surface is covered in taste buds the tongues upper surface is also covered in numerous lingual papillae it is sensitive and kept moist by saliva and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels in humans a secondary function of the tongue is phonetic articulation the tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth  the ability to perceive different tastes is not localised in different parts of the tongue as is widely believed  this error arose because of misinterpretation of some 19thcentury research see tongue map   the tongue is a muscular structure that forms part of the floor of the oral cavity the left and right sides of the tongue are separated by the lingual septum the human tongue is divided into anterior and posterior parts the anterior part is the visible part situated at the front and makes up roughly twothirds the length of the tongue the posterior part is the part closest to the throat roughly onethird of its length these parts differ in terms of their embryological development and nerve supply the two parts of the tongue are divided by the terminal sulcus   the anterior tongue is at its apex thin and narrow it is directed forward against the lingual surfaces of the lower incisor teeth the posterior part is at its root directed backward and connected with the hyoid bone by the hyoglossi and genioglossi muscles and the hyoglossal membrane with the epiglottis by three folds glossoepiglottic of mucous membrane with the soft palate by the glossopalatine arches and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the mucous membrane it also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx in phonetics and phonology a distinction is made between the tip of the tongue and the blade the portion just behind the tip sounds made with the tongue tip are said to be apical while those made with the tongue blade are said to be laminal the eight muscles of the human tongue are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic the four intrinsic muscles act to change the shape of the tongue and are not attached to any bone the four extrinsic muscles act to change the position of the tongue and are anchored to bone coronal section of tongue showing intrinsic muscles lateral view of the tongue with extrinsic muscles highlighted the extrinsic muscles originate from bone and extend to the tongue their main functions are altering the tongues position allowing for protrusion retraction and sidetoside movement   four paired intrinsic muscles of the tongue originate and insert within the tongue running along its length these muscles alter the shape of the tongue by lengthening and shortening it curling and uncurling its apex and edges and flattening and rounding its surface this provides shape and helps facilitate speech swallowing and eating   the tongue receives its blood supply primarily from the lingual artery a branch of the external carotid artery the lingual veins drain into the internal jugular vein the floor of the mouth also receives its blood supply from the lingual artery   there is also a secondary blood supply to the tongue from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery an area in the neck sometimes called pirogovs triangle is formed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle and the hypoglossal nerve   the lingual artery is a good place to stop severe hemorrage from the tongue innervation of the tongue consists of motor fibers special sensory fibers for taste and general sensory fibers for sensation   innervation of taste and sensation is different for the anterior and posterior part of the tongue because they are derived from different embryological structures pharyngeal arch 1 and pharyngeal arch 3 and 4 respectively  the tongue is covered with numerous taste buds and filiform fungiform vallate and foliate lingual papillae   the average length of the human tongue from the oropharynx to the tip is 10cms in length  the anterior tongue is derived primarily from the first pharyngeal arch the posterior tongue is derived primarily from the third pharyngeal arch the second arch however has a substantial contribution during fetal development but this later atrophies the fourth arch may also contribute depending upon how the boundaries of the tongue are defined the terminal sulcus which separates the anterior and posterior tongue is shaped like a v with the tip of the v situated posteriorly at the apex is the foramen caecum which is the point where the embryological thyroid begins to descend   chemicals that stimulate taste receptor cells are known as tastants once a tastant is dissolved in saliva it can make contact with the plasma membrane of the gustatory hairs which are the sites of taste transduction  the tongue is equipped with many taste buds on its dorsal surface and each taste bud is equipped with taste receptor cells that can sense particular classes of tastes distinct types of taste receptor cells respectively detect substances that are sweet bitter salty sour spicy or taste of umami  umami receptor cells are the least understood and accordingly are the type most intensively under research  the tongue is also used for crushing food against the hard palate during mastication the epithelium on the tongues upper or dorsal surface is keratinised consequently the tongue can grind against the hard palate without being itself damaged or irritated  after the gums the tongue is the second most common soft tissue site for various pathologies in the oral cavity  examples of pathological conditions of the tongue include glossitis eg geographic tongue median rhomboid glossitis burning mouth syndrome oral hairy leukoplakia oral candidiasis and squamous cell carcinoma  food debris desquamated epithelial cells and bacteria often form a visible tongue coating  this coating has been identified as a major contributing factor in bad breath halitosis  which can be managed by brushing the tongue gently with a toothbrush or using special oral hygiene instruments such as tongue scrapers or mouth brushes  the sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin and underlain by a plexus of veins this is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body the sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system bypassing the gastrointestinal tract this is the only convenient and efficacious route of administration apart from iv administration of nitroglycerin to a patient suffering chest pain from angina pectoris the tongue can be used as a metonym for language as in the phrase mother tongue many languages  have the same word for tongue and language a common temporary failure in word retrieval from memory is referred to as the tipofthetongue phenomenon the expression tongue in cheek refers to a statement that is not to be taken entirely seriously  something said or done with subtle ironic or sarcastic humour a tongue twister is a phrase made specifically to be very difficult to pronounce aside from being a medical condition tonguetied means being unable to say what you want to due to confusion or restriction the phrase cat got your tongue refers to when a person is speechless to bite ones tongue is a phrase which describes holding back an opinion to avoid causing offence a slip of the tongue refers to an unintentional utterance such as a freudian slip speaking in tongues is a common phrase used to describe glossolalia which is to make smooth languageresembling sounds that is no true spoken language itself a deceptive person is said to have a forked tongue and a smoothtalking person said to have a silver tongue sticking ones tongue out at someone is considered a childish gesture of rudeness andor defiance in many countries the act may also have sexual connotations depending on the way in which it is done however in tibet it is considered a greeting  in 2009 a farmer from fabriano italy was convicted and fined by the countrys highest court for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor with whom he had been arguing proof of the affront had been captured with a cell phone camera  blowing a raspberry can also be meant as a gesture of derision  being a cultural custom for long time tongue piercing and splitting has become quite common in western countries in recent decades with up to onefifth of young adults having at least one piece of body art in the tongue  the tongues of some animals are consumed and sometimes considered delicacies hot tongue sandwiches are frequently found on menus in kosher delicatessens in america taco de lengua lengua being spanish for tongue is a taco filled with beef tongue and is especially popular in mexican cuisine as part of colombian gastronomy tongue in sauce lengua en salsa is a dish prepared by frying the tongue adding tomato sauce onions and salt tongue can also be prepared as birria pig and beef tongue are consumed in chinese cuisine duck tongues are sometimes employed in szechuan dishes while lambs tongue is occasionally employed in continental and contemporary american cooking fried cod tongue is a relatively common part of fish meals in norway and newfoundland in argentina and uruguay cow tongue is cooked and served in vinegar lengua a la vinagreta in the czech republic and poland a pork tongue is considered a delicacy and there are many ways of preparing it in eastern slavic countries pork and beef tongues are commonly consumed boiled and garnished with horseradish or jelled beef tongues fetch a significantly higher price and are considered more of a delicacy in alaska cow tongues are among the more common tongues of seals and whales have been eaten sometimes in large quantities by sealers and whalers and in various times and places have been sold for food on shore  the word tongue derives from the old english tunge which comes from protogermanic tung\u014dn  it has cognates in other germanic languages  for example tonge in west frisian tong in dutchafrikaans zunge in german tunge in danishnorwegian and tunga in icelandicfaroeseswedish the ue ending of the word seems to be a fourteenthcentury attempt to show proper pronunciation but it is neither etymological nor phonetic  some used the spelling tunge and tonge as late as the sixteenth century most vertebrate animals have tongues in mammals such as dogs and cats the tongue is often used to clean the fur and body the tongues of these species have a very rough texture which allows them to remove oils and parasites a dogs tongue also acts as a heat regulator as a dog increases its exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow the tongue hangs out of the dogs mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work to cool the bloodflow   some animals have tongues that are specially adapted for catching prey for example chameleons frogs and anteaters have prehensile tongues many species of fish have small folds at the base of their mouths that might informally be called tongues but they lack a muscular structure like the true tongues found in most tetrapods   other animals may have organs that are analogous to tongues such as a butterflys proboscis or a radula on a mollusc but these are not homologous with the tongues found in vertebrates and often have little resemblance in function for example butterflies do not lick with their proboscides they suck through them and the proboscis is not a single organ but two jaws held together to form a tube  the human tongue other human tongue spots on the tongue exclusive lines on

V eyes are the organs of vision they detect light and convert it into electrochemical impulses in neurons in higher organisms the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment regulates its intensity through a diaphragm focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image converts this image into a set of electrical signals and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms and 96 of animal species possess a complex optical system  imageresolving eyes are present in molluscs chordates and arthropods  the simplest eyes such as those in microorganisms do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms  from more complex eyes retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex   complex eyes can distinguish shapes and colours the visual fields of many organisms especially predators involve large areas of binocular vision to improve depth perception in other organisms eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view such as in rabbits and horses which have monocular vision the first protoeyes evolved among animals 600 million years ago about the time of the cambrian explosion  the last common ancestor of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96 of animal species in six of the 35  main phyla  in most vertebrates and some molluscs the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a lightsensitive panel of cells known as the retina at the rear of the eye the cone cells for colour and the rod cells for lowlight contrasts in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision the visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve such eyes are typically roughly spherical filled with a transparent gellike substance called the vitreous humour with a focusing lens and often an iris the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye  and reducing aberrations when there is enough light  the eyes of most cephalopods fish amphibians and snakes have fixed lens shapes and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lenssimilar to how a camera focuses  compound eyes are found among the arthropods and are composed of many simple facets which depending on the details of anatomy may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images per eye each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cells some eyes have up to 28000 such sensors which are arranged hexagonally and which can give a full 360 field of vision compound eyes are very sensitive to motion some arthropods including many strepsiptera have compound eyes of only a few facets each with a retina capable of creating an image creating vision with each eye viewing a different thing a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain providing very different highresolution images possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision the mantis shrimp has been reported to have the worlds most complex colour vision system  trilobites which are now extinct had unique compound eyes they used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses of their eyes in this they differ from most other arthropods which have soft eyes the number of lenses in such an eye varied however some trilobites had only one and some had thousands of lenses in one eye in contrast to compound eyes simple eyes are those that have a single lens for example jumping spiders have a large pair of simple eyes with a narrow field of view supported by an array of other smaller eyes for peripheral vision some insect larvae like caterpillars have a different type of simple eye stemmata which gives a rough image some of the simplest eyes called ocelli can be found in animals like some of the snails which cannot actually see in the normal sense they do have photosensitive cells but no lens and no other means of projecting an image onto these cells they can distinguish between light and dark but no more this enables snails to keep out of direct sunlight in organisms dwelling near deepsea vents compound eyes have been secondarily simplified and adapted to spot the infrared light produced by the hot ventsin this way the bearers can spot hot springs and avoid being boiled alive  photoreception is phylogenetically very old with various theories of phylogenesis  the common origin monophyly of all animal eyes is now widely accepted as fact this is based upon the shared genetic features of all eyes that is all modern eyes varied as they are have their origins in a protoeye believed to have evolved some 540 million years ago    and the pax6 gene is considered a key factor in this the majority of the advancements in early eyes are believed to have taken only a few million years to develop since the first predator to gain true imaging would have touched off an arms race   among all species that did not flee the photopic environment prey animals and competing predators alike would be at a distinct disadvantage without such capabilities and would be less likely to survive and reproduce hence multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel except those of groups such as the vertebrates that were only forced into the photopic environment at a late stage eyes in various animals show adaptation to their requirements for example the eye of a bird of prey has much greater visual acuity than a human eye and in some cases can detect ultraviolet radiation the different forms of eye in for example vertebrates and molluscs are examples of parallel evolution despite their distant common ancestry phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye but this is not the case as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes  and different lens crystallins show  the very earliest eyes called eyespots were simple patches of photoreceptor protein in unicellular animals in multicellular beings multicellular eyespots evolved physically similar to the receptor patches for taste and smell these eyespots could only sense ambient brightness they could distinguish light and dark but not the direction of the light source  through gradual change the eyespots of species living in welllit environments depressed into a shallow cup shape the ability to slightly discriminate directional brightness was achieved by using the angle at which the light hit certain cells to identify the source the pit deepened over time the opening diminished in size and the number of photoreceptor cells increased forming an effective pinhole camera that was capable of dimly distinguishing shapes  however the ancestors of modern hagfish thought to be the protovertebrate  were evidently pushed to very deep dark waters where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators and where it is advantageous to have a convex eyespot which gathers more light than a flat or concave one this would have led to a somewhat different evolutionary trajectory for the vertebrate eye than for other animal eyes the thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eyes aperture originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering blocked harmful radiation improved the eyes refractive index and allowed functionality outside of water the transparent protective cells eventually split into two layers with circulatory fluid in between that allowed wider viewing angles and greater imaging resolution and the thickness of the transparent layer gradually increased in most species with the transparent crystallin protein  the gap between tissue layers naturally formed a bioconvex shape an optimally ideal structure for a normal refractive index independently a transparent layer and a nontransparent layer split forward from the lens the cornea and iris separation of the forward layer again formed a humour the aqueous humour this increased refractive power and again eased circulatory problems formation of a nontransparent ring allowed more blood vessels more circulation and larger eye sizes  there are ten different eye layoutsindeed every technological method of capturing an optical image commonly used by human beings with the exceptions of zoom and fresnel lenses occur in nature  eye types can be categorised into simple eyes with one concave photoreceptive surface and compound eyes which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface  note that simple does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity indeed any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment the only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolutionthe physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1 also superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes so are better suited to darkdwelling creatures  eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptors cellular construction with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated as in the vertebrates or rhabdomeric these two groups are not monophyletic the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells   and some annelids possess both  simple eyes are rather ubiquitous and lensbearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates cephalopods annelids crustaceans and cubozoa  pit eyes also known as stemma are eyespots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eyespot to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light  found in about 85 of phyla these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of simple eye they are small comprising up to about 100 cells covering about 100µm  the directionality can be improved by reducing the size of the aperture by incorporating a reflective layer behind the receptor cells or by filling the pit with a refractile material  pit vipers have developed pits that function as eyes by sensing thermal infrared radiation in addition to their optical wavelength eyes like those of other vertebrates the resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens which may greatly reduce the blur radius encounteredhence increasing the resolution obtainable  the most basic form seen in some gastropods and annelids consists of a lens of one refractive index a far sharper image can be obtained using materials with a high refractive index decreasing to the edges this decreases the focal length and thus allows a sharp image to form on the retina  this also allows a larger aperture for a given sharpness of image allowing more light to enter the lens and a flatter lens reducing spherical aberration  such an inhomogeneous lens is necessary in order for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius to 25 radii  heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times four or more times in gastropods once in the copepods once in the annelids once in the cephalopods  and once in the chitons which have aragonite lenses  no aquatic organisms possess homogeneous lenses presumably the evolutionary pressure for a heterogeneous lens is great enough for this stage to be quickly outgrown  this eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring to minimise the effect of eye motion while the animal moves most such eyes have stabilising eye muscles  the ocelli of insects bear a simple lens but their focal point always lies behind the retina consequently they can never form a sharp image ocelli pittype eyes of arthropods blur the image across the whole retina and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain  focusing the image would also cause the suns image to be focused on a few receptors with the possibility of damage under the intense light shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity  this fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up because light especially uv light which is absorbed by vegetation usually comes from above  some marine organisms bear more than one lens for instance the copepod pontella has three the outer has a parabolic surface countering the effects of spherical aberration while allowing a sharp image to be formed another copepod copilia has two lenses in each eye arranged like those in a telescope  such arrangements are rare and poorly understood but represent an alternative construction multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders which have a refractive cornea discussed next these have a negative lens enlarging the observed image by up to 50 over the receptor cells thus increasing their optical resolution  in the eyes of most mammals birds reptiles and most other terrestrial vertebrates along with spiders and some insect larvae the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air  in general the lens is not spherical spherical lenses produce spherical aberration in refractive corneas the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material see luneburg lens or with an aspheric shape  flattening the lens has a disadvantage the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus thus animals that have evolved with a wide fieldofview often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens  as mentioned above a refractive cornea is only useful out of water in water there is little difference in refractive index between the vitreous fluid and the surrounding water hence creatures that have returned to the water  penguins and seals for example  lose their highly curved cornea and return to lensbased vision an alternative solution borne by some divers is to have a very strongly focusing cornea  an alternative to a lens is to line the inside of the eye with mirrors and reflect the image to focus at a central point  the nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye one would see the same image that the organism would see reflected back out  many small organisms such as rotifers copepods and platyhelminths use such organs but these are too small to produce usable images  some larger organisms such as scallops also use reflector eyes the scallop pecten has up to 100 millimetrescale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell it detects moving objects as they pass successive lenses  there is at least one vertebrate the spookfish whose eyes include reflective optics for focusing of light each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below the light coming from above is focused by a lens while that coming from below by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals  a compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia ommatidium singular the image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia individual eye units which are located on a convex surface thus pointing in slightly different directions compared with simple eyes compound eyes possess a very large view angle and can detect fast movement and in some cases the polarisation of light  because the individual lenses are so small the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained assuming that they do not function as phased arrays this can only be countered by increasing lens size and number to see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes humans would require very large compound eyes around 11 m in radius  compound eyes fall into two groups apposition eyes which form multiple inverted images and superposition eyes which form a single erect image  compound eyes are common in arthropods and are also present in annelids and some bivalved molluscs  compound eyes in arthropods at least grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia  apposition eyes are the most common form of eyes and are presumably the ancestral form of compound eyes they are found in all arthropod groups although they may have evolved more than once within this phylum  some annelids and bivalves also have apposition eyes they are also possessed by limulus the horseshoe crab and there are suggestions that other chelicerates developed their simple eyes by reduction from a compound starting point  some caterpillars appear to have evolved compound eyes from simple eyes in the opposite fashion apposition eyes work by gathering a number of images one from each eye and combining them in the brain with each eye typically contributing a single point of information the typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium the second type is named the superposition eye the superposition eye is divided into three types the refracting the reflecting and the parabolic superposition eye the refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom and no side wall each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side the result is an image at half the radius of the eye which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are this type of compound eye is normally found in nocturnal insects because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes though at the cost of reduced resolution  in the parabolic superposition compound eye type seen in arthropods such as mayflies the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array longbodied decapod crustaceans such as shrimp prawns crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses this eye type functions by refracting light then using a parabolic mirror to focus the image it combines features of superposition and apposition eyes  another kind of compound eye found in strepsiptera employs a series of simple eyeseyes having one opening that provides light for an entire imageforming retina several of these eyelets together form the strepsipteran compound eye which is akin to the schizochroal compound eye some trilobites had because each eyelet is a simple eye it produces an inverted image those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye this arrangement allows vision under low light levels  good fliers such as flies or honey bees or preycatching insects such as praying mantis or dragonflies have specialised zones of ommatidia organised into a fovea area which gives acute vision in the acute zone the eyes are flattened and the facets larger the flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution the black spot that can be seen on the compound eyes of such insects which always seems to look directly at the observer is called a pseudopupil this occurs because the ommatidia which one observes headon along their optical axes absorb the incident light while those to one side reflect it  there are some exceptions from the types mentioned above some insects have a socalled single lens compound eye a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multilens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes then there is the mysid shrimp dioptromysis paucispinosa the shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type in the rear behind this in each eye there is a single large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone this projects an upright image on a specialised retina the resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye another version is the pseudofaceted eye as seen in scutigera this type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ocelli on each side of the head organised in a way that resembles a true compound eye the body of ophiocoma wendtii a type of brittle star is covered with ommatidia turning its whole skin into a compound eye the same is true of many chitons the tube feet of sea urchins contain photoreceptor proteins which together act as a compound eye they lack screening pigments but can detect the directionality of light by the shadow cast by its opaque body  the ciliary body is triangular in horizontal section and is coated by a double layer the ciliary epithelium the inner layer is transparent and covers the vitreous body and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina the outer layer is highly pigmented continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium and constitutes the cells of the dilator muscle the vitreous is the transparent colourless gelatinous mass that fills the space between the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye  it is produced by certain retinal cells it is of rather similar composition to the cornea but contains very few cells mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field as well as the hyalocytes of balazs of the surface of the vitreous which reprocess the hyaluronic acid no blood vessels and 9899 of its volume is water as opposed to 75 in the cornea with salts sugars vitrosin a type of collagen a network of collagen type ii fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts amazingly with so little solid matter it tautly holds the eye eyes are generally adapted to the environment and life requirements of the organism which bears them for instance the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required with horizonscanning organisms such as those that live on the african plains having a horizontal line of highdensity ganglia while treedwelling creatures which require good allround vision tend to have a symmetrical distribution of ganglia with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre of course for most eye types it is impossible to diverge from a spherical form so only the density of optical receptors can be altered in organisms with compound eyes it is the number of ommatidia rather than ganglia that reflects the region of highest data acquisition   optical superposition eyes are constrained to a spherical shape but other forms of compound eyes may deform to a shape where more ommatidia are aligned to say the horizon without altering the size or density of individual ommatidia  eyes of horizonscanning organisms have stalks so they can be easily aligned to the horizon when this is inclined for example if the animal is on a slope  an extension of this concept is that the eyes of predators typically have a zone of very acute vision at their centre to assist in the identification of prey  in deep water organisms it may not be the centre of the eye that is enlarged the hyperiid amphipods are deep water animals that feed on organisms above them their eyes are almost divided into two with the upper region thought to be involved in detecting the silhouettes of potential preyor predatorsagainst the faint light of the sky above accordingly deeper water hyperiids where the light against which the silhouettes must be compared is dimmer have larger uppereyes and may lose the lower portion of their eyes altogether  depth perception can be enhanced by having eyes which are enlarged in one direction distorting the eye slightly allows the distance to the object to be estimated with a high degree of accuracy  acuity is higher among male organisms that mate in midair as they need to be able to spot and assess potential mates against a very large backdrop  on the other hand the eyes of organisms which operate in low light levels such as around dawn and dusk or in deep water tend to be larger to increase the amount of light that can be captured  it is not only the shape of the eye that may be affected by lifestyle eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function  eyes may be mounted on stalks to provide better allround vision by lifting them above an organisms carapace this also allows them to track predators or prey without moving the head  visual acuity or resolving power is the ability to distinguish fine detail and is the property of cone cells  it is often measured in cycles per degree cpd which measures an angular resolution or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles resolution in cpd can be measured by bar charts of different numbers of whiteblack stripe cycles for example if each pattern is 175cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye it will subtend an angle of 1 degree so the number of whiteblack bar pairs on the pattern will be a measure of the cycles per degree of that pattern the highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes or distinguish from a grey block is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye for a human eye with excellent acuity the maximum theoretical resolution is 50 cpd  12 arcminute per line pair or a 035mm line pair at 1 m a rat can resolve only about 1 to 2 cpd  a horse has higher acuity through most of the visual field of its eyes than a human has but does not match the high acuity of the human eyes central fovea region  spherical aberration limits the resolution of a 7mm pupil to about 3 arcminutes per line pair at a pupil diameter of 3mm the spherical aberration is greatly reduced resulting in an improved resolution of approximately 17 arcminutes per line pair  a resolution of 2 arcminutes per line pair equivalent to a 1 arcminute gap in an optotype corresponds to 2020 normal vision in humans however in the compound eye the resolution is related to the size of individual ommatidia and the distance between neighbouring ommatidia physically these cannot be reduced in size to achieve the acuity seen with single lensed eyes as in mammals compound eyes have a much lower acuity than vertebrate eyes  color vision is the faculty of the organism to distinguish lights of different spectral qualities  all organisms are restricted to a small range of electromagnetic spectrum this varies from creature to creature but is mainly between wavelengths of 400 and 700nm  this is a rather small section of the electromagnetic spectrum probably reflecting the submarine evolution of the organ water blocks out all but two small windows of the em spectrum and there has been no evolutionary pressure among land animals to broaden this range  the most sensitive pigment rhodopsin has a peak response at 500nm  small changes to the genes coding for this protein can tweak the peak response by a few nm  pigments in the lens can also filter incoming light changing the peak response  many organisms are unable to discriminate between colours seeing instead in shades of grey colour vision necessitates a range of pigment cells which are primarily sensitive to smaller ranges of the spectrum in primates geckos and other organisms these take the form of cone cells from which the more sensitive rod cells evolved  even if organisms are physically capable of discriminating different colours this does not necessarily mean that they can perceive the different colours only with behavioural tests can this be deduced  most organisms with colour vision are able to detect ultraviolet light this high energy light can be damaging to receptor cells with a few exceptions snakes placental mammals most organisms avoid these effects by having absorbent oil droplets around their cone cells the alternative developed by organisms that had lost these oil droplets in the course of evolution is to make the lens impervious to uv light  this precludes the possibility of any uv light being detected as it does not even reach the retina  the retina contains two major types of lightsensitive photoreceptor cells used for vision the rods and the cones rods cannot distinguish colours but are responsible for lowlight scotopic monochrome blackandwhite vision they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment rhodopsin visual purple which is sensitive at low light intensity but saturates at higher photopic intensities rods are distributed throughout the retina but there are none at the fovea and none at the blind spot rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina cones are responsible for color vision they require brighter light to function than rods require in humans there are three types of cones maximally sensitive to longwavelength mediumwavelength and shortwavelength light often referred to as red green and blue respectively though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours the colour seen is the combined effect of stimuli to and responses from these three types of cone cells cones are mostly concentrated in and near the fovea only a few are present at the sides of the retina objects are seen most sharply in focus when their images fall on the fovea as when one looks at an object directly cone cells and rods are connected through intermediate cells in the retina to nerve fibres of the optic nerve when rods and cones are stimulated by light they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres the optic nerves send off impulses through these fibres to the brain  the pigment molecules used in the eye are various but can be used to define the evolutionary distance between different groups and can also be an aid in determining which are closely related  although problems of convergence do exist  opsins are the pigments involved in photoreception other pigments such as melanin are used to shield the photoreceptor cells from light leaking in from the sides the opsin protein group evolved long before the last common ancestor of animals and has continued to diversify since  there are two types of opsin involved in vision copsins which are associated with ciliarytype photoreceptor cells and ropsins associated with rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells  the eyes of vertebrates usually contain cilliary cells with copsins and bilaterian invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with ropsins however some ganglion cells of vertebrates express ropsins suggesting that their ancestors used this pigment in vision and that remnants survive in the eyes  likewise copsins have been found to be expressed in the brain of some invertebrates they may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form  copsins are also found in some derived bilaterianinvertebrate eyes such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs however the lateral eyes which were presumably the ancestral type for this group if eyes evolved once there always use ropsins  cnidaria which are an outgroup to the taxa mentioned above express copsins  but ropsins are yet to be found in this group  incidentally the melanin produced in the cnidaria is produced in the same fashion as that in vertebrates suggesting the common descent of this pigment  the structures of the eye labeled another view

V the human eye is an organ that reacts to light and has several purposes as a sense organ the mammalian eye allows vision rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth the human eye can distinguish about 10 million colors  similar to the eyes of other mammals the human eyes nonimageforming photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina receive light signals which affect adjustment of the size of the pupil regulation and suppression of the hormone melatonin and entrainment of the body clock    the eye is not shaped like a perfect sphere rather it is a fused twopiece unit the smaller frontal unit transparent and more curved called the cornea is linked to the larger white unit called the sclera the corneal segment is typically about 8mm 03in in radius the sclerotic chamber constitutes the remaining fivesixths its radius is typically about 12mm the cornea and sclera are connected by a ring called the limbus the iris is the colored circular structure concentrically surrounding the center of the eye the pupil which appears to be black a device known as an ophthalmoscope is used to see inside the eye  the dimensions differ among adults by only one or two millimetres it is remarkably consistent across different ethnicities the vertical measure generally less than the horizontal distance is about 24mm among adults at birth about 1617 millimetres about 065inch the transverse size of a human adult eye is approximately 242mm and the sagittal size is 237mm with no significant difference between sexes and age groups strong correlation was found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit r  088  the eyeball grows rapidly increasing to 22523mm approx 089 in by three years of age by age 13 the eye attains its full size the typical adult eye has an anterior to posterior diameter of 24 millimetres a volume of six cubic centimetres 04 cu in  and a mass of 75 grams weight of 025 oz  the eye is made up of three coats enclosing three transparent structures the outermost layer known as the fibrous tunic is composed of the cornea and sclera the middle layer known as the vascular tunic or uvea consists of the choroid ciliary body and iris the innermost is the retina which gets its circulation from the vessels of the choroid as well as the retinal vessels which can be seen in an ophthalmoscope within these coats are the aqueous humour the vitreous body and the flexible lens the aqueous humour is a clear fluid that is contained in two areas the anterior chamber between the cornea and the iris and the posterior chamber between the iris and the lens the lens is suspended to the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament zonule of zinn made up of fine transparent fibers the vitreous body is a clear jelly that is much larger than the aqueous humour present behind the lens and the rest is bordered by the sclera zonule and lens they are connected via the pupil  the approximate field of view of an individual human eye measured from the fixation point ie the point at which ones gaze is directed is 60 superior up 60 nasal towards the nose 7075 inferior down and 100110 temporal away from the nose and towards the temple    for both eyes the combined visual field is 130135 vertical and 200 horizontal   when viewed at large angles the iris and pupil appear to be rotated toward the viewer as a result the pupil may still be visible at angles greater than 90    about 1215 temporal and 15 below the horizontal is the optic nerve or blind spot which is roughly 75 high and 55 wide  the retina has a static contrast ratio of around 100 0001 about 65 fstops as soon as the eye moves saccades it readjusts its exposure both chemically and mechanically by adjusting the iris which regulates the size of the pupil initial dark adaptation takes place in approximately four seconds of profound uninterrupted darkness full adaptation through adjustments in retinal chemistry the purkinje effect is mostly complete in thirty minutes the process is nonlinear and multifaceted so an interruption by light merely starts the adaptation process over again full adaptation is dependent on good blood flow thus dark adaptation may be hampered by poor circulation and vasoconstrictors like tobacco  the human eye can detect a luminance range of 10  or one hundred trillion 100000000000000 about 465 fstops from 10  cdm  or one millionth 0000001 of a candela per square meter to 10  cdm  or one hundred million 100000000 candelas per square meter    this range does not include looking at the midday sun 10  cdm   or lightning discharge at the low end of the range is the absolute threshold of vision for a steady light across a wide field of view about 10  cdm2 0000001 candela per square meter   the upper end of the range is given in terms of normal visual performance as 10  cdm  100000000 or one hundred million candelas per square meter  the eye includes a lens similar to lenses found in optical instruments such as cameras and the same principles can be applied the pupil of the human eye is its aperture the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop refraction in the cornea causes the effective aperture the entrance pupil to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter the entrance pupil is typically about 4mm in diameter although it can range from 2mm f83 in a brightly lit place to 8mm f21 in the dark the latter value decreases slowly with age older peoples eyes sometimes dilate to not more than 56mm   the visual system in the human brain is too slow to process information if images are slipping across the retina at more than a few degrees per second  thus to be able to see while moving the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes frontaleyed animals have a small area of the retina with very high visual acuity the fovea centralis it covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people to get a clear view of the world the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea any failure to make eye movements correctly can lead to serious visual disabilities having two eyes allows the brain to determine the depth and distance of an object both eyes must point accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas otherwise double vision occurs the movements of different body parts are controlled by striated muscles acting around joints the movements of the eye are no exception but they have special advantages not shared by skeletal muscles and joints and so are considerably different  each eye has six muscles that control its movements the lateral rectus the medial rectus the inferior rectus the superior rectus the inferior oblique and the superior oblique when the muscles exert different tensions a torque is exerted on the globe that causes it to turn in almost pure rotation with only about one millimeter of translation  thus the eye can be considered as undergoing rotations about a single point in the center of the eye rapid eye movement rem typically refers to the sleep stage during which the most vivid dreams occur during this stage the eyes move rapidly it is not in itself a unique form of eye movement saccades are quick simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction controlled by the frontal lobe of the brain some irregular drifts movements smaller than a saccade and larger than a microsaccade subtend up to one tenth of a degree even when looking intently at a single spot the eyes drift around this ensures that individual photosensitive cells are continually stimulated in different degrees without changing input these cells would otherwise stop generating output microsaccades move the eye no more than a total of 02 in adult humans the vestibuloocular reflex is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field for example when the head moves to the right the eyes move to the left and vice versa eyes can also follow a moving object around this tracking is less accurate than the vestibuloocular reflex as it requires the brain to process incoming visual information and supply feedback following an object moving at constant speed is relatively easy though the eyes will often make saccadic jerks to keep up the smooth pursuit movement can move the eye at up to 100s in adult humans it is more difficult to visually estimate speed in low light conditions or while moving unless there is another point of reference for determining speed the optokinetic reflex is a combination of a saccade and smooth pursuit movement when for example looking out of the window at a moving train the eyes can focus on a moving train for a short moment through smooth pursuit until the train moves out of the field of vision at this point the optokinetic reflex kicks in and moves the eye back to the point where it first saw the train through a saccade the adjustment to closerange vision involves three processes to focus an image on the retina when a creature with binocular vision looks at an object the eyes must rotate around a vertical axis so that the projection of the image is in the centre of the retina in both eyes to look at an object close by the eyes rotate towards each other convergence while for an object farther away they rotate away from each other divergence exaggerated convergence is called cross eyed viewing focusing on ones nose for example lenses cannot refract light rays at their edges as well as they can closer to the center the image produced by any lens is therefore somewhat blurry around the edges spherical aberration it can be minimized by screening out peripheral light rays and looking only at the betterfocused center in the eye the pupil serves this purpose by constricting while the eye is focused on nearby objects in this way the pupil has a dual purpose to adjust the eye to variations in brightness and to reduce spherical aberration  accommodation by changing the curvature of the lens is carried out by the ciliary muscles surrounding the lens they narrow the diameter of the ciliary body relax the fibers of the suspensory ligament and allow the lens to relax into a more convex shape a more convex lens refracts light more strongly and focuses divergent light rays onto the retina allowing for closer objects to be brought into focus   the human eye contains enough complexity to warrant specialized attention and care beyond the duties of a general practitioner these specialists or eye care professionals serve different functions in different countries each eye care professional can typically be categorized into one or a multiplicity ie an ophthalmologist can perform surgery and in some instances prescribe lenses which is a duty often performed by optometrists of duties of the following types of professionals eye irritation has been defined as the magnitude of any stinging scratching burning or other irritating sensation from the eye  it is a common problem experienced by people of all ages related eye symptoms and signs of irritation are discomfort dryness excess tearing itching grating sandy sensation ocular fatigue pain scratchiness soreness redness swollen eyelids and tiredness etc these eye symptoms are reported with intensities from severe to mild it has been suggested that these eye symptoms are related to different causal mechanisms  several suspected causal factors in our environment have been studied so far  one hypothesis is that indoor air pollution may cause eye and airway irritation   eye irritation depends somewhat on destabilization of the outereye tear film in which the formation of dry spots result in such ocular discomfort as dryness    occupational factors are also likely to influence the perception of eye irritation some of these are lighting glare and poor contrast gaze position a limited number of breaks and a constant function of accommodation musculoskeletal burden and impairment of the visual nervous system   another factor that may be related is work stress   in addition psychological factors have been found in multivariate analyses to be associated with an increase in eye irritation among vdu users   other risk factors such as chemical toxinsirritants eg amines formaldehyde acetaldehyde acrolein ndecane vocs ozone pesticides and preservatives allergens etc might cause eye irritation as well certain volatile organic compounds that are both chemically reactive and airway irritants may cause eye irritation personal factors eg use of contact lenses eye makeup and certain medications may also affect destabilization of the tear film and possibly result in more eye symptoms  nevertheless if airborne particles alone should destabilize the tear film and cause eye irritation their content of surfaceactive compounds must be high  an integrated physiological risk model with blink frequency destabilization and breakup of the eye tear film as inseparable phenomena may explain eye irritation among office workers in terms of occupational climate and eyerelated physiological risk factors  there are two major measures of eye irritation one is blink frequency which can be observed by human behavior the other measures are break up time tear flow hyperemia redness swelling tear fluid cytology and epithelial damage vital stains etc which are human beings physiological reactions blink frequency is defined as the number of blinks per minute and it is associated with eye irritation blink frequencies are individual with mean frequencies of  23 to 2030 blinksminute and they depend on environmental factors including the use of contact lenses dehydration mental activities work conditions room temperature relative humidity and illumination all influence blink frequency breakup time but is another major measure of eye irritation and tear film stability  it is defined as the time interval in seconds between blinking and rupture but is considered to reflect the stability of the tear film as well in normal persons the breakup time exceeds the interval between blinks and therefore the tear film is maintained  studies have shown that blink frequency is correlated negatively with breakup time this phenomenon indicates that perceived eye irritation is associated with an increase in blink frequency since the cornea and conjunctiva both have sensitive nerve endings that belong to the first trigeminal branch   other evaluating methods such as hyperemia cytology etc have increasingly been used to assess eye irritation there are other factors that are related to eye irritation as well three major factors that influence the most are indoor air pollution contact lenses and gender differences field studies have found that the prevalence of objective eye signs is often significantly altered among office workers in comparisons with random samples of the general population     these research results might indicate that indoor air pollution has played an important role in causing eye irritation there are more and more people wearing contact lens now and dry eyes appear to be the most common complaint among contact lens wearers    although both contact lens wearers and spectacle wearers experience similar eye irritation symptoms dryness redness and grittiness have been reported far more frequently among contact lens wearers and with greater severity than among spectacle wearers  studies have shown that incidence of dry eyes increases with age   especially among women  tear film stability eg breakup time is significantly lower among women than among men in addition women have a higher blink frequency while reading  several factors may contribute to gender differences one is the use of eye makeup another reason could be that the women in the reported studies have done more vdu work than the men including lower grade work a third oftenquoted explanation is related to the agedependent decrease of tear secretion particularly among women after 40 years of age    in a study conducted by ucla the frequency of reported symptoms in industrial buildings was investigated  the studys results were that eye irritation was the most frequent symptom in industrial building spaces at 81 modern office work with use of office equipment has raised concerns about possible adverse health effects  since the 1970s reports have linked mucosal skin and general symptoms to work with selfcopying paper emission of various particulate and volatile substances has been suggested as specific causes these symptoms have been related to sick building syndrome sbs which involves symptoms such as irritation to the eyes skin and upper airways headache and fatigue  many of the symptoms described in sbs and multiple chemical sensitivity mcs resemble the symptoms known to be elicited by airborne irritant chemicals  a repeated measurement design was employed in the study of acute symptoms of eye and respiratory tract irritation resulting from occupational exposure to sodium borate dusts  the symptom assessment of the 79 exposed and 27 unexposed subjects comprised interviews before the shift began and then at regular hourly intervals for the next six hours of the shift four days in a row  exposures were monitored concurrently with a personal real time aerosol monitor two different exposure profiles a daily average and short term 15 minute average were used in the analysis exposureresponse relations were evaluated by linking incidence rates for each symptom with categories of exposure  acute incidence rates for nasal eye and throat irritation and coughing and breathlessness were found to be associated with increased exposure levels of both exposure indices steeper exposureresponse slopes were seen when short term exposure concentrations were used results from multivariate logistic regression analysis suggest that current smokers tended to be less sensitive to the exposure to airborne sodium borate dust  several actions can be taken to prevent eye irritation in addition other measures are proper lid hygiene avoidance of eye rubbing  and proper use of personal products and medication eye makeup should be used with care  the paraphilic practice of oculolinctus or eyeballlicking may also cause irritations infections or damage to the eye  there are many diseases disorders and agerelated changes that may affect the eyes and surrounding structures as the eye ages certain changes occur that can be attributed solely to the aging process most of these anatomic and physiologic processes follow a gradual decline with aging the quality of vision worsens due to reasons independent of diseases of the aging eye while there are many changes of significance in the nondiseased eye the most functionally important changes seem to be a reduction in pupil size and the loss of accommodation or focusing capability presbyopia the area of the pupil governs the amount of light that can reach the retina the extent to which the pupil dilates decreases with age leading to a substantial decrease in light received at the retina in comparison to younger people it is as though older persons are constantly wearing mediumdensity sunglasses therefore for any detailed visually guided tasks on which performance varies with illumination older persons require extra lighting certain ocular diseases can come from sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and genital warts if contact between the eye and area of infection occurs the std can be transmitted to the eye  with aging a prominent white ring develops in the periphery of the cornea called arcus senilis aging causes laxity downward shift of eyelid tissues and atrophy of the orbital fat these changes contribute to the etiology of several eyelid disorders such as ectropion entropion dermatochalasis and ptosis the vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction posterior vitreous detachment or pvd and its opacities  visible as floaters  gradually increase in number various eye care professionals including ophthalmologists optometrists and opticians are involved in the treatment and management of ocular and vision disorders a snellen chart is one type of eye chart used to measure visual acuity at the conclusion of a complete eye examination the eye doctor might provide the patient with an eyeglass prescription for corrective lenses some disorders of the eyes for which corrective lenses are prescribed include myopia nearsightedness which affects about onethird  of the human population hyperopia farsightedness which affects about one quarter of the population astigmatism and presbyopia the loss of focusing range during aging macular degeneration is especially prevalent in the us and affects roughly 175 million americans each year  having lower levels of lutein and zeaxanthin within the macula may be associated with an increase in the risk of agerelated macular degeneration   lutein and zeaxanthin act as antioxidants that protect the retina and macula from oxidative damage from highenergy light waves  as the light waves enter the eye they excite electrons that can cause harm to the cells in the eye but before they can cause oxidative damage that may lead to macular degeneration or cataracts lutein and zeaxanthin bind to the electron free radical and are reduced rendering the electron safe there are many ways to ensure a diet rich in lutein and zeaxanthin the best of which is to eat dark green vegetables including kale spinach broccoli and turnip greens  nutrition is an important aspect of the ability to achieve and maintain proper eye health lutein and zeaxanthin are two major carotenoids found in the macula of the eye that are being researched to identify their role in the pathogenesis of eye

V a cerebral organoid describes artificially grown in vitro miniature organs resembling the brain cerebral organoids are created by culturing human pluripotent stem cells in a threedimensional rotational bioreactor and develop over a course of months  the human brain is an extremely complex system of heterogeneous tissues and consists of an extremely diverse array of neurons this complexity has made studying the brain and understanding how it works a difficult task in neuroscience especially when it comes to neurodegenerative diseases the purpose of creating an in vitro neurological model is to study these diseases in a more simple and variable space free of in vivo limitations especially when working with humans the varying physiology between human and other mammalian models limits the scope of study in neurological disorders cerebral organoids are synthesized tissues that contain several types of nerve cells and have anatomical features that resemble mammalian brains cerebral organoids are most similar to layers of neurons called the cortex and choroid plexus in some cases structures similar to the retina meninges and hippocampus can form   stem cells have the potential to grow into many different types of tissues and their fate is dependent on many factors below is an image showing some of the chemical factors that can lead stem cells to differentiate into various neural tissues similar techniques are used on stem cells used to grow cerebral organoids  using human pluripotent stem cells to create in vitro cerebral organoids allows researchers to summarize current developmental mechanisms for human neural tissue as well as study the roots of human neurological diseases cerebral organoids are an investigative tool used to understand how disease pathology works these organoids can be used in experiments that current in vitro methods are too simple for while also being more human applicable than rodent or other mammalian models historically major breakthroughs in how the brain works have resulted from injury or disorder in human brain function leading to understanding of how regions of the brain work an in vitro human brain model would allow for the next wave in understanding of the human brain   in addition to being used as tools to study disease pathology and treatments future application of cerebral organoids include direct implantation into a host like a human being the organoid can fuse with host tissue in areas of neurodegeneration being incorporated with the host vasculature and be immunologically silent  a list of potential applications for cerebral organoids is highlighted below   organoids can be used to study the crucial early stages of brain development test drugs and because they can be made from living cells study individual patients  in one case a cerebral organoid grown from a patient with microcephaly demonstrated related symptoms and revealed that apparently the cause is overly rapid development followed by slower brain growth microencephaly is a developmental condition in which the brain remains undersized producing an undersized head and debilitation microcephaly is not suitable for mouse models which do not replicate the condition  the primary form of the disease is thought to be caused by a homozygous mutation in the microcephalin gene the disease is difficult to reproduce in mouse models because mice lack the developmental stages for an enlarged cerebral cortex that humans have naturally a disease which affects this development would be impossible to show in a model which does not have it to begin with  to use cerebral organoids to model a humans microcephaly one group of researchers has taken patient skin fibroblasts and reprogrammed them using four well known reprogramming factors these include oct4 sox2 myc and klf4 the reprogrammed sample was able to be cloned into induced pluripotent stem cells the cells were cultured into a cerebral organoid following a process described in the cerebral organoid creation section below the organoid that resulted had decreased numbers of neural progenitor cells and smaller tissues additionally the patient derived tissues displayed fewer and less frequent neuroepithelial tissues made of progenitors decreased radial glial stem cells and increased neurons these results suggest that the underlying mechanism of microcephaly is caused by cells prematurely differentiating into neurons leaving a deficit of radial glial cells  to make an organoid an embryoid tissue that has some embryonic features grown from natural stem cells is used embryos have three layers endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm each turns into various body parts the nervous system grows from the ectoderm which also contributes dental enamel and the epidermis  ectodermal cells were placed into gel droplets and floated in a nutrient broth in a rotating bioreactor which supported cell growth without forming by the container after ten days the organoid developed neurons after 30 days it displayed regions similar to parts of brains lacking a blood supply cerebral organoids reach about 4mm across and can last a year or more  the general procedure can be broken down into 5 steps first human pluripotent stem cells are cultured they are then allowed to cultivate into an embryoid body next the cell culture is induced to form a neuroectoderm the neuroectoderm is them grown in a matrigel droplet the matrigel provides nutrients and the neuroectoderm starts to proliferate and grow however the lack of vasculature limits the size the organoid can grow this has been the major limitation in organoid development however new methods using a spinning bioreactor have allowed an increase in the availability of nutrients to cells inside the organoid this last step has been the key breakthrough in organoid development  spinning bioreactors have been used increasingly in cell culture and tissue growth applications the reactor is able to deliver faster cell doubling times increased cell expansion and increased extracellular matrix components when compared to statically cultured cells  figure this flow chart outlines the basic steps to create a cerebral organoid the process takes a span of months and the size of the organoid is limited to the availability of nutrients it has been shown that cerebral organoids grown using the spinning bioreactor 3d culture method differentiate into various neural tissue types such as the optic cup hippocampus ventral parts of the teleencephelon and dorsal cortex  the neural stemprogenitor cells are unique because they are able to selfrenew and are multipotent this means they can generate neurons and glial cells which are to two main components of neural systems the fate of these cells is controlled by several factors that affect the differentiation process the spatial location and temporal attributes of neural progenitor cells can influence if the cells form neurons or glial cells further differentiation is then controlled by extracellular conditions and cell signaling  the exact conditions and stimuli necessary to differentiate neural progenitor cells into specific neural tissues such as hippocampal tissue optic nerve cerebral cortex etc are unknown it is believed that cerebral organoids can be used to study the developmental mechanisms of these processes  to test if the neural progenitor cells and stem cells are differentiating into specific neural tissues several gene markers can be tested two markers that are present during pluripotent stages are oct4 and nanog these two markers are diminished during the course of development for the organoid neural identity markers that note successful neural induction sox1 and pax6 are upregulated during organoid development these changes in expression support the case for selfguided differentiation of cerebral organoids  markers for forebrain and hindbrain can also be tested forebrain markers foxg1 and six3 are highly expressed throughout organoid development however hindbrain markers egr2 and isl1 show early presence ut decrease in the later stages this imbalance towards forebrain development is similar to developmental expansion of forebrain tissue in human brain development  to test if organoids develop even further into regional specification gene markers for cerebral cortex and occipital lobe have been tested many regions that have forebrain marker foxg1 labeling them as regions with cerebral cortical morphology were also positive for marker emx1 which indicates dorsal cortical identity these specific regions can be even further specified by markers auts2 tshz2 and lmo4 with the first representing cerebral cortex and the two after representing the occipital lobe  genetic markers for the hippocampus ventral forebrain and choroid plexus are also present in cerebral organoids however the overall structures of these regions have not yet been formed cerebral organoids also possess functional cerebral cortical neurons these neurons must form on the radially organized cortical plate the marker tbr1 is present in the preplate the precursor to the cortical plate and is present along with map2 a neuronal marker in 30dayold cerebral organoids these markers are indicative of a basal neural layer similar to a preplate these cells are also apically adjacent to a neutral zone and are reelin positive which indicates the presence of cajalretzius cells the cajalretzius cells are important to the generation of cortical plate architecture  the cortical plate is usually generated insideout such that later born neurons migrate to the top superficial layers this organization is also present in cerebral organoids based on genetic marker testing neurons that are early born have marker ctip2 and are located adjacent to the tbr1 exhibiting preplate cells late born neurons with markers satb2 and brn2 are located in a superficial layer further away from the preplate than the early born neurons suggesting cortical plate layer formation additionally after 75 days of formation cerebral organoids show a rudimentary marginal zone a cellpoor region the formation of layered cortical plate is very basic in cerebral organoids and suggests the organoid lacks the cues and factors to induce formation of layer iivi organization  the cerebral organoid neurons can however form axons as shown by gfp staining gfp labeled axons have been shown to have complex branching and growth cone formation additionally calcium dye imaging has shown cerebral organoids to have ca  oscillations and spontaneous calcium surges in individual cells the calcium signaling can be enhanced through glutamate and inhibited through tetrodotoxin  it is not fully understood how individual localized tissues formed by stem cells are able to coordinate with surrounding tissues to develop into a whole organ  it has been shown however that most tissue differentiation requires interactions with surrounding tissues and depends on diffusible induction factors to either inhibit or encourage various differentiation and physical localization  cerebral organoid differentiation is somewhat localized the previously mentioned markers for forebrain and hindbrain are physically localized appearing in clusters this suggests that local stimuli are released once one or more cells differentiates into a specific type as opposed to a random pathway throughout the tissue the markers for subspecification of cortical lobes prefrontal cortex and occipital lobe are also physically localized however the hippocampus and ventral forebrain cells are not physically localized and are randomly located through the cerebral organoid  cerebral organoids lack blood vessels and are limited in size by nutrient uptake in the innermost cells spinning bioreactors and advanced 3d scaffolding techniques are able to increase organoid size however a nutrient delivery system will spark the next big leap in cerebral organoid development

V the violet gland or supracaudal gland is an important gland located on the upper surface of the tail of certain mammals including european badgers and canids such as foxes wolves and the domestic dog   as well as the domestic cat  like many other mammalian secretion glands the violet gland consists of modified sweat glands and sebaceous glands it is used for intraspecies signalling scent marking and contributes to the strong odor of foxes in particular although it secretes a mixture of volatile terpenes similar to those produced by violets hence the name the chemicals are produced in much greater quantity than in flowers and the resulting strong smell can be quite unpleasant in dogs the violet or supracaudal gland is found approximately above the 9th caudal vertebra but depending on breed it may be vestigial or entirely absent the violet gland secretes protein and hydrophobic lipids has wide excretory ducts is connected with coarse hairs devoid of cysts and has no sexual dimorphism in the dog and cat fancy it is often referred to as stud tail despite the fact that it occurs in all sexes not just breeding males however for reasons still unknown the hair at a dogs violet gland tends to fall out when androgen levels are high over a prolonged time in shorthaired breeds the usually inconspicuous gland may thus appear as a noticeably sparsely haired patch and it is this condition of the gland area that is most frequent in stud dogs in foxes the violet gland is found on the upper surface of the tail at roughly onethird of the tails length from the body and measures about 25 by 75 millimeters in red foxes due to its role in steroid hormone metabolism and possibly production foxes cannot be descented by removing this gland for unknown reasons the glands secretions are fluorescent in ultraviolet light this may result from the presence of carotenoids in the european badger the secretions of the violet gland contain a high concentration of lipids with a composition that varies seasonally researchers  at the university of oxford have identified 110 compounds produced by the violet gland using gas chromatography it was found that specific compositions were shared among groups of badgers while the secretions of individual badgers varied according to age gender health and reproductive status

V rainer rene graf adelmann von adelmannsfelden born 1948 in wartaweil bavaria as rene freiherr von godin  is a former german lawyer best known for founding the bund deutscher legionäre english federation of german mercenaries the christliche vereinigung zur familienförderung englishchristian association for family development an agency dealing with the adoption of unborn babies and a business in dealing with organ donations   he also operated a number of other business entities like the der wettbewerbsbeobachter englishthe competition monitor and the zentralkomitee für die allgemeinbefolgung obergerichtlicher rechtssprechung in wettbewerbssachen both targeting small businesses who made small clerical errors in advertisement by fining them or taking them to court for violating competition law  after failing his training as catholic deacon because he had been a member of the youth organisation of the social democratic party of germany  adelman formed his own church the erzbistum münchen der heiligen katholischen orthodoxen evangelischen kirche des heiligen apostels matthäus englisharchbishopric of munich of the holy catholic orthodox church of the apostle matthew and awarded offices within the church he also operated a funeral business for a time  additionally he ventured into the business of trafficking asylum seekers to germany proposing to combine the former with his organ donor business if the asylum seekers were unable to pay   it was for his role in the trafficking of asylum seekers and providing them with false papers that he was sent to 15 month in jail on probation in 1992  when his house was searched by the police in 1987 in connection to the trafficking of asylum seekers it was the 14th time that the police had done so in just a few years  german newspaper die zeit described his reputation as a businessman without scruple he was mainly active in the 1980s and during that time attracted media attention but has not done so since his conviction in 1992  by his own description graf adelmann is a man with many ideas    rainer rene graf adelmann von adelmannsfelden was born under the name rene freiherr von godin as the son of a bavarian lawyer in 1948 he married michaela gräfin adelmann von adelmannsfelden born 1953 in 1973 and the couple had ten children born between 1974 and 1988 his wife is the niece of the late german federal mp 19571961 raban graf adelmann 19121992  rene freiherr von godin assumed the title graf adelmann von adelmannsfelden in 1980 during the mid1980s the couple resided in the village of sentenhart near wald between lake constance and sigmaringen  the bavarian ministry of justice cancelled graf adelmanns registration as a lawyer in the state in 1982 for discrediting acts unworthy of a lawyer however adelman took the case to the bundesgerichtshof but eventually decided to discontinue his registration himself   graf adelmann in the early 1980s founded the federation of german mercenaries for the purpose of recruiting mercenaries in germany for service in asian and african countries  german law prohibits the recruitment of german citizens for military service in foreign countries and the very attempt is punishable with up to five years of jail however graf adelmann considered this law invalid as it in his opinion violates the freedom of employment specified in the german constitution  he operated his business through the company terfina vermögensverwaltungsgmbh and contacted foreign mainly asian and african embassies and governments for the purpose of building a clientele by 1985 graf adelmann had over 400 job applications targeting former bundeswehr soldiers and unemployed adventurers through newspaper ads in 1985 he claimed to have received interest from an undisclosed african country for the purpose of protecting an oil pipeline  he also claimed to have interests from mozambique to provide personnel for the protection of the cahora bassa dam he saw an opportunity to provide personnel to developing countries who still required adjustments to their borders and forms of government but lacked qualified personnel to operate their modern weapons equipment his initial plan was to recruit a platoon of 50 mercenaries led by a number of retired bundeswehr sergeants  to join the bund deutscher legionäre bdl one had to pay dm 20 as a joining fee followed by another dm 20 as a yearly membership fee for this graf adelmann promised combat training in belgium and shooting practise in switzerland at the weapons manufacturers premises his new recruits would have to learn to kill but he saw great potential in 18yearolds in this regard he also guaranteed that the bodies of fallen heroes would be returned to germany and their memory adequately honoured  another business graf adelmann operated was the christian association for family development targeted at childless parents who were interested in adopting an as yet unborn or unconceived baby the association was officially shut down in the mid1980s but continued to operate nevertheless adelman charged up to dm 32000 for a successful adoption with part of this money going to the mother of the child the prosecutors office at konstanz investigated against the business but was unable to prosecute as it violated no existing law at the time declaring adelmann had found a loop hole   he later opened an agency for adoption in frankfurt am main in early 1988 but had to close after the mayor of the city ordered it shut down  the business suffered a temporary setback when his aunt was arrested in manila for kidnapping but later released  in the business of organ donations graf adelmann would approach people who recently had to declare bankruptcy as published in the bundesanzeiger a federal publication and offered to help them to financial recovery by paying up to dm 80000 for a kidney depending on the quality of the organ surgery would then be performed in france adelman claiming that organ donation for money being legal there despite the fact that both french and german doctors had voluntarily outlawed such transactions in france however at the time donations from live donors were acceptable providing no money was involved graf adelmann just simply would keep the full truth from the performing clinic and thereby was able to carry out his business   graf adelmann later declared that no operations were carried out in 1989 he tried to expand his business to the united kingdom and was able to find a number of willing donors there offering between us30000 and 50000 per kidney with the intention of making a 20 cut on every operation the willing donors never heard from graf adelmann again after the initial contact shortly after the british parliament banned the sale of human organs for the purpose of transplants  graf adelmanns activities even prompted a request in the german parliament the bundestag in 1989 to tighten the organ donor law in the country and to shorten the lengthy donation process a number of mps of the social democratic party of germany posted the question what the federal government would do against adelmanns activities  regarding personal names graf is a title translated as count not a first or middle name the female form is gräfin regarding personal names freiherr is a former title translated as baron which is now legally a part of the last name the feminine forms are freifrau and freiin as royalty and its privileges have been abolished in germany the name graf adelmann von adelmannsfelden is one complex family name only and not a family name and a title the part of graf in this family name is only a part of this family name and not a legally valid title

V the visual cortex of the brain is the part of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing visual information this article addresses the ventraldorsal model of the visual cortex another model for the perceptualconceptual neuropsychological model of the visual cortex was studied by raftopolous  in russian neuropsychology yet another model was discussed by alexander luria for the anteriorposterior approach to understanding the visual cortex  the visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex which is in turn located at the back of the head or skull the visual cortex is made up of brodmann area 17 the primary visual cortex and brodmann areas 18 and 19 the extrastriate cortical areas  the primary parts of the cortex that receive sensory inputs from the thalamus visual cortex is also known as v1 visual area one and the striate cortex the extrastriate areas consist of visual areas two v2 three v3 four v4 and five v5 both hemispheres of a brain contain a visual cortex the left hemisphere visual cortex receives signals from the right visual field and the right visual cortex from the left visual field   this article addresses the ventraldorsal model of the visual cortex another model for the perceptualconceptual neuropsychological model of the visual cortex was studied by raftopolous  in russian neurospychology yet another model was discussed by alexander luria for the anteriorposterior approach to understanding the visual cortex  the primary visual cortex v1 is the koniocortex sensory type  located in and around the calcarine fissure in the occipital lobe each hemispheres v1 receives information directly from its ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus that receives signs from the contralateral visual field each v1 transmits information to two primary pathways called the ventral stream and the dorsal stream the what vs where account of the ventraldorsal pathways was first described by ungerleider and mishkin  more recently goodale and milner  extended these ideas and suggested that the ventral stream is critical for visual perception whereas the dorsal stream mediates the visual control of skilled actions although these ideas are contentious among some vision scientists and psychologists the proposed division of labor between visionforperception and visionforaction is supported by a broad range of findings from neuropsychology neurophysiology and neuroimaging some of the most controversial evidence comes from studies of visuomotor behaviour in normal observers for example it has been shown that visual illusions such as the ebbinghaus illusion distort judgements of a perceptual nature but when the subject responds with an action such as grasping no distortion occurs  other work such as the one from scharnowski and gegenfurtner  suggests that both the action and perception systems are equally fooled by such illusions more recent studies however provide strong support for the idea that skilled actions such as grasping are not affected by pictorial illusions   and suggest that the actionperception dissociation is a useful way to characterize the functional division of labor between the dorsal and ventral visual pathways in the cerebral cortex  neurons in the visual cortex fire action potentials when visual stimuli appear within their receptive field by definition the receptive field is the region within the entire visual field that elicits an action potential but for any given neuron it may respond best to a subset of stimuli within its receptive field this property is called neuronal tuning in the earlier visual areas neurons have simpler tuning for example a neuron in v1 may fire to any vertical stimulus in its receptive field in the higher visual areas neurons have complex tuning for example in the inferior temporal cortex it a neuron may fire only when a certain face appears in its receptive field the visual cortex receives its blood supply primarily from the calcarine branch of the posterior cerebral artery research on the primary visual cortex can involve recording action potentials from electrodes within the brain of cats ferrets rats mice or monkeys or through recording intrinsic optical signals from animals or eeg meg or fmri signals from human and monkey v1 one recent discovery concerning the human v1 is that signals measured by fmri show very large attentional modulation this result is consistent with another recent electrophysiology study the study found that although v1 processes visual information before v2 and v4 the attentional modulation occurs in v4 followed by v2 and then finally in v1 suggesting attentional modulation occurs through feedback from higherlevel visual areas to lowerlevel visual areas  other current work on v1 seeks to fully characterize its tuning properties and to use it as a model area for the canonical cortical circuit lesions to primary visual cortex usually lead to a scotoma or hole in the visual field note that patients with scotomas are often able to make use of visual information presented to their scotomas despite being unable to consciously perceive it this phenomenon has been partially covered in one aspect of what larry weiskrantz of oxford university called blindsight and is widely studied by scientists who are also interested in the neural correlates of consciousness the primary visual cortex is the beststudied visual area in the brain in all mammals studied it is located in the posterior pole of the occipital cortex the occipital cortex is responsible for processing visual stimuli it is the simplest earliest cortical visual area it is highly specialized for processing information about static and moving objects and is excellent in pattern recognition the functionally defined primary visual cortex is approximately equivalent to the anatomically defined striate cortex the name striate cortex is derived from the line of gennari a distinctive stripe visible to the naked eye that represents myelinated axons from the lateral geniculate body terminating in layer 4 of the gray matter the primary visual cortex is divided into six functionally distinct layers labeled 1 through 6 layer 4 which receives most visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus lgn is further divided into 4 layers labelled 4a 4b 4c\u03b1 and 4c\u03b2 sublamina 4c\u03b1 receives most magnocellular input from the lgn while layer 4c\u03b2 receives input from parvocellular pathways the occipital cortex where the visual cortex resides is the smallest of the four cortexes of the human brain which also includes the temporal cortex parietal cortex and frontal cortex the average number of neurons in the adult human primary visual cortex in each hemisphere has been estimated at around 140 million  v1 has a very welldefined map of the spatial information in vision for example in humans the upper bank of the calcarine sulcus responds strongly to the lower half of visual field below the center and the lower bank of the calcarine to the upper half of visual field in concept this retinotopic mapping is a transformation of the visual image from retina to v1 the correspondence between a given location in v1 and in the subjective visual field is very precise even the blind spots are mapped into v1 in terms of evolution this correspondence is very basic and found in most animals that possess a v1 in human and animals with a fovea in the retina a large portion of v1 is mapped to the small central portion of visual field a phenomenon known as cortical magnification  perhaps for the purpose of accurate spatial encoding neurons in v1 have the smallest receptive field size of any visual cortex microscopic regions the tuning properties of v1 neurons what the neurons respond to differ greatly over time early in time 40 ms and further individual v1 neurons have strong tuning to a small set of stimuli that is the neuronal responses can discriminate small changes in visual orientations spatial frequencies and colors furthermore individual v1 neurons in human and animals with binocular vision have ocular dominance namely tuning to one of the two eyes in v1 and primary sensory cortex in general neurons with similar tuning properties tend to cluster together as cortical columns david hubel and torsten wiesel proposed the classic icecube organization model of cortical columns for two tuning properties ocular dominance and orientation however this model cannot accommodate the color spatial frequency and many other features to which neurons are tuned  the exact organization of all these cortical columns within v1 remains a hot topic of current research the mathematical modeling of this function has been compared to gabor transforms later in time after 100 ms neurons in v1 are also sensitive to the more global organisation of the scene lamme  roelfsema 2000  these response properties probably stem from recurrent feedback processing the influence of highertier cortical areas on lowertier cortical areas and lateral connections from pyramidal neurons hupe et al 1998 while feedforward connections are mainly driving feedback connections are mostly modulatory in their effects angelucci et al 2003 hupe et al 2001 evidence shows that feedback originating in higherlevel areas such as v4 it or mt with bigger and more complex receptive fields can modify and shape v1 responses accounting for contextual or extraclassical receptive field effects guo et al 2007 huang et al 2007 sillito et al 2006 the visual information relayed to v1 is not coded in terms of spatial or optical imagery but rather are better described as edge detection as an example for an image comprising half side black and half side white the divide line between black and white has strongest local contrast that is edge detection and is encoded while few neurons code the brightness information black or white per se as information is further relayed to subsequent visual areas it is coded as increasingly nonlocal frequencyphase signals note that at these early stages of cortical visual processing spatial location of visual information is well preserved amid the local contrast encoding edge detection visual area v2 or secondary visual cortex also called prestriate cortex  is the second major area in the visual cortex and the first region within the visual association area it receives strong feedforward connections from v1 direct and via the pulvinar and sends strong connections to v3 v4 and v5 it also sends strong feedback connections to v1 in terms of anatomy v2 is split into four quadrants a dorsal and ventral representation in the left and the right hemispheres together these four regions provide a complete map of the visual world v2 has many properties in common with v1 cells are tuned to simple properties such as orientation spatial frequency and color the responses of many v2 neurons are also modulated by more complex properties such as the orientation of illusory contours binocular disparity  and whether the stimulus is part of the figure or the ground qiu and von der heydt 2005 recent research has shown that v2 cells show a small amount of attentional modulation more than v1 less than v4 are tuned for moderately complex patterns and may be driven by multiple orientations at different subregions within a single receptive field it is argued that the entire ventral visualtohippocampal stream is important for visual memory  this theory unlike the dominant one predicts that objectrecognition memory orm alterations could result from the manipulation in v2 an area that is highly interconnected within the ventral stream of visual cortices in the monkey brain this area receives strong feedforward connections from the primary visual cortex v1 and sends strong projections to other secondary visual cortices v3 v4 and v5   most of the neurons of this area are tuned to simple visual characteristics such as orientation spatial frequency size color and shape    v2 cells also respond to various complex shape characteristics such as the orientation of illusory contours  and whether the stimulus is part of the figure or the ground  anatomical studies implicate layer 3 of area v2 in visualinformation processing in contrast to layer 3 layer 6 of the visual cortex is composed of many types of neurons and their response to visual stimuli is more complex in a recent study the layer 6 cells of the v2 cortex were found to play a very important role in the storage of object recognition memory as well as the conversion of shortterm object memories into longterm memories  the term third visual complex refers to the region of cortex located immediately in front of v2 which includes the region named visual area v3 in humans the complex nomenclature is justified by the fact that some controversy still exists regarding the exact extent of area v3 with some researchers proposing that the cortex located in front of v2 may include two or three functional subdivisions for example david van essen and others 1986 have proposed the existence of a dorsal v3 in the upper part of the cerebral hemisphere which is distinct from the ventral v3 or ventral posterior area vp located in the lower part of the brain dorsal and ventral v3 have distinct connections with other parts of the brain appear different in sections stained with a variety of methods and contain neurons that respond to different combinations of visual stimulus for example colourselective neurons are more common in the ventral v3 additional subdivisions including v3a and v3b have also been reported in humans these subdivisions are located near dorsal v3 but do not adjoin v2 dorsal v3 is normally considered to be part of the dorsal stream receiving inputs from v2 and from the primary visual area and projecting to the posterior parietal cortex it may be anatomically located in brodmann area 19 braddick using fmri has suggested that area v3v3a may play a role in the processing of global motion  other studies prefer to consider dorsal v3 as part of a larger area named the dorsomedial area dm which contains a representation of the entire visual field neurons in area dm respond to coherent motion of large patterns covering extensive portions of the visual field lui and collaborators 2006 ventral v3 vp has much weaker connections from the primary visual area and stronger connections with the inferior temporal cortex while earlier studies proposed that vp contained a representation of only the upper part of the visual field above the point of fixation more recent work indicates that this area is more extensive than previously appreciated and like other visual areas it may contain a complete visual representation the revised more extensive vp is referred to as the ventrolateral posterior area vlp by rosa and tweedale  visual area v4 is one of the visual areas in the extrastriate visual cortex in macaques it is located anterior to v2 and posterior to posterior inferotemporal area pit it comprises at least four regions left and right v4d left and right v4v and some groups report that it contains rostral and caudal subdivisions as well it is unknown what the human homologue of v4 is and this issue is currently the subject of much scrutiny  v4 is the third cortical area in the ventral stream receiving strong feedforward input from v2 and sending strong connections to the pit it also receives direct inputs from v1 especially for central space in addition it has weaker connections to v5 and dorsal prelunate gyrus dp v4 is the first area in the ventral stream to show strong attentional modulation most studies indicate that selective attention can change firing rates in v4 by about 20 a seminal paper by moran and desimone characterizing these effects was the first paper to find attention effects anywhere in the visual cortex   like v2 v4 is tuned for orientation spatial frequency and color unlike v2 v4 is tuned for object features of intermediate complexity like simple geometric shapes although no one has developed a full parametric description of the tuning space for v4 visual area v4 is not tuned for complex objects such as faces as areas in the inferotemporal cortex are the firing properties of v4 were first described by semir zeki in the late 1970s who also named the area before that v4 was known by its anatomical description the prelunate gyrus originally zeki argued that the purpose of v4 was to process color information work in the early 1980s proved that v4 was as directly involved in form recognition as earlier cortical areas this research supported the two streams hypothesis first presented by ungerleider and mishkin in 1982 recent work has shown that v4 exhibits longterm plasticity encodes stimulus salience is gated by signals coming from the frontal eye fields and shows changes in the spatial profile of its receptive fields with attention visual area v5 also known as visual area mt middle temporal is a region of extrastriate visual cortex that is thought to play a major role in the perception of motion the integration of local motion signals into global percepts and the guidance of some eye movements  mt is connected to a wide array of cortical and subcortical brain areas its inputs include the visual cortical areas v1 v2 and dorsal v3 dorsomedial area   the koniocellular regions of the lgn  and the inferior pulvinar  the pattern of projections to mt changes somewhat between the representations of the foveal and peripheral visual fields with the latter receiving inputs from areas located in the midline cortex and retrosplenial region  a standard view is that v1 provides the most important input to mt  nonetheless several studies have demonstrated that neurons in mt are capable of responding to visual information often in a directionselective manner even after v1 has been destroyed or inactivated  moreover research by semir zeki and collaborators has suggested that certain types of visual information may reach mt before it even reaches v1 mt sends its major outputs to areas located in the cortex immediately surrounding it including areas fst mst and v4t middle temporal crescent other projections of mt target the eye movementrelated areas of the frontal and parietal lobes frontal eye field and lateral intraparietal area the first studies of the electrophysiological properties of neurons in mt showed that a large portion of the cells are tuned to the speed and direction of moving visual stimuli   these results suggested that mt plays a significant role in the processing of visual motion lesion studies have also supported the role of mt in motion perception and eye movements  neuropsychological studies of a patient unable to see motion seeing the world in a series of static frames instead suggested that v5 in the primate is homologous to mt in the human   however since neurons in v1 are also tuned to the direction and speed of motion these early results left open the question of precisely what mt could do that v1 could not much work has been carried out on this region as it appears to integrate local visual motion signals into the global motion of complex objects  for example lesion to the v5 leads to deficits in perceiving motion and processing of complex stimuli it contains many neurons selective for the motion of complex visual features line ends corners microstimulation of a neuron located in the v5 affects the perception of motion for example if one finds a neuron with preference for upward motion in a monkeys v5 and stimulates it with an electrode then the monkey becomes more likely to report upward motion when presented with stimuli containing left and right as well as upward components  there is still much controversy over the exact form of the computations carried out in area mt  and some research suggests that feature motion is in fact already available at lower levels of the visual system such as v1     mt was shown to be organized in direction columns  deangelis argued that mt neurons were also organized based on their tuning for binocular disparity  the dorsomedial area dm also known as v6 appears to respond to visual stimuli associated with selfmotion   and widefield stimulation  v6 is a subdivision of the visual cortex of primates first described by john allman and jon kaas in 1975  v6 is located in the dorsal part of the extrastriate cortex near the deep groove through the centre of the brain medial longitudinal fissure and typically also includes portions of the medial cortex such as the parietooccipital sulcus dm contains a topographically organized representation of the entire field of vision like the middle temporal area v5 dm receives direct connections from the primary visual cortex also similar to v5 dm is also characterized by high myelin content a characteristic that is usually present in brain structures involved in fast transmission of information  for many years it was considered that dm only existed in new world monkeys however more recent research has suggested that dm also exists in old world monkeys and perhaps humans v6 is also sometimes referred to as the parietooccipital area po although the correspondence is not exact   neurons in area dmv6 have unique response properties including an extremely sharp selectivity for the orientation of visual contours and preference for long uninterrupted lines covering large parts of the visual field   however in comparison with area mt a much smaller proportion of dm cells shows selectivity for the direction of motion of visual patterns another notable difference is that cells in dm are attuned to low spatial frequency components of an image and respond poorly to the motion of textured patterns such as a field of random dots in contrast cells in mt are often strongly responsive to such stimuli these response properties suggest that dm and mt may work in parallel with the former analyzing selfmotion relative to the environment and the latter analyzing the motion of individual objects relative to the background recently an area responsive to wideangle flow fields has been identified in the human and is thought to be a homologue of macaque area v6  the connections and response properties of cells in dm v6 suggest that this area is a key node in a subset of the dorsal stream referred to by some as the dorsomedial pathway this pathway is likely to be important for the control of skeletomotor activity including postural reactions and reaching movements towards objects   the main feedforward connection of dm is to the cortex immediately rostral to it in the interface between the occipital and parietal lobes v6a this region has in turn relatively direct connections with the regions of the frontal lobe that control arm movements including the premotor cortex

V the sebaceous glands are microscopic exocrine glands in the skin that secrete an oily or waxy matter called sebum to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals in humans they are found in the greatest number on the face and scalp and are also found on all parts of the skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet the type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine in the eyelids meibomian glands also called tarsal glands are a type of sebaceous gland that secrete a special type of sebum into tears fordyce spots are ectopic misplaced sebaceous glands found usually on the lips gums and inner cheeks areolar glands surround the female nipples preputial glands also known as tysons glands are found in the genitals of both sexes of mice and rats there are several related medical conditions including acne sebaceous cysts hyperplasia and sebaceous adenoma these are usually attributable to overactive sebaceous glands which produce an excess of sebum   the sebaceous glands are found throughout all areas of the skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet  there are two types of sebaceous gland those connected to hair follicles in pilosebaceous units and those that exist independently  sebaceous glands are found in haircovered areas where they are connected to hair follicles one or more glands may surround each hair follicle and the glands themselves are surrounded by arrector pili muscles the glands have an acinar structure like a manylobed berry in which multiple glands branch off a central duct the glands deposit sebum on the hairs and bring it to the skin surface along the hair shaft the structure consisting of hair hair follicle arrector pili muscles and sebaceous gland is an epidermal invagination known as a pilosebaceous unit  sebaceous glands are also found in hairless areas glabrous skin of the eyelids nose penis labia minora the inner mucosal membrane of the cheek and nipples  some sebaceous glands have unique names sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek are known as fordyce spots and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as montgomerys glands  sebaceous glands are first visible from the 13th to the 16th week of fetal development as bulgings off hair follicles  sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that gives rise to the epidermis of the skin overexpression of the signalling factors wnt myc and shh all increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland presence  the sebaceous glands of a human fetus secrete a substance called vernix caseosa a waxy translucent white substance coating the skin of newborns  after birth activity of the glands decreases until there is almost no activity during ages 26 years and then increases to a peak of activity during puberty due to heightened levels of androgens  sebaceous glands secrete the oily waxy substance called sebum latin fat tallow that is made of triglycerides wax esters squalene and metabolites of fatproducing cells   sebum waterproofs and lubricates the skin and hair of mammals  sebaceous secretions in conjunction with apocrine glands also play an important thermoregulatory role in hot conditions the secretions emulsify the sweat produced by the eccrine glands and this produces a sheet of sweat that is not readily lost in drops of sweat this is of importance in delaying dehydration in colder conditions the nature of sebum becomes more lipid and in coating the hair and skin rain is effectively repelled   sebum is produced in a holocrine process in which cells within the sebaceous gland rupture and disintegrate as they release the sebum and the cell remnants are secreted together with the sebum   the cells are constantly replaced by mitosis at the base of the duct  sebum secreted by the sebaceous gland in humans is primarily composed of triglycerides 41 wax esters 26 squalene 12 and free fatty acids 16   the composition of sebum varies across species  wax esters like squalene are unique to sebum and not produced anywhere else in the body  sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans and is implicated in the development of acne  sebum is odorless but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors  sex steroids are known to affect the rate of sebum secretion androgens such as testosterone have been shown to stimulate secretion and estrogens have been shown to inhibit secretion dihydrotestosterone acts as the primary androgen in the prostate and in hair follicles   sebaceous glands are part of the bodys integumentary system and serve to protect the body against germs sebaceous glands are responsible for the secretion of acids that form the acid mantle this is a very fine slightly acidic film on the surface of the skin which acts as a barrier to bacteria viruses and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin  the ph of the skin is between 45 and 62  and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants  sebaceous lipids make an important contribution in maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier and express both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory properties   sebum may act as a delivery system for antioxidants antimicrobial lipids pheromones and hydration of the stratum corneum  the insoluble fatty acids contained within sebum have broad antimicrobial activity   additionally sebaceous gland secretion provides vitamin e to the upper layers of facial skin  during the last three months of fetal development the sebaceous glands of the fetus produce vernix caseosa a waxy white substance which coats the skin to protect it from amniotic fluid  the areolar glands are in the areola that surrounds the nipple in the female breast these glands secrete an oily fluid which lubricates the nipple and also secrete volatile compounds that are thought to serve as an olfactory stimulus for the newborn during pregnancy and lactation these glands also called montgomerys glands become enlarged  meibomian glands in the eyelids secrete a form of sebum called meibum onto the eye that slows the evaporation of tears  it also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together the meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands zeis glands and palpebral glands  they attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids fordyce spots or fordyce granules are ectopic sebaceous glands found on the genitals and oral mucosa they show themselves as yellowishwhite milia milkspots  earwax is partly composed of sebum produced by glands in the ear canal these secretions are viscous and have a high lipid content which gives good lubrication properties  sebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as acne and keratosis pilaris in the skin pores sebum and keratin can create a hyperkeratotic plug called a comedo acne is a very common problem particularly during puberty in teenagers and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors the increased production of sebum can lead to a blockage of the sebaceous gland duct a result of this is the appearance of a comedo commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead which can then result in a propensity to infection particularly by the bacteria propionibacterium acnes this can inflame the comedones which then change into the characteristic acne lesions comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands particularly the face shoulders upper chest and back comedones may be black or white depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit or just the sebaceous duct is blocked  sebaceous filaments which are innocuous buildups of sebum can often be mistaken for whiteheads there are many treatments available for acne from reducing sugars in the diet to medications that include antibiotics benzoyl peroxide retinoids and hormonal treatments  retinoids reduce the amount of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands  should the usual treatments fail the presence of the demodex mite could be looked for as the possible cause  other conditions that involve the sebaceous glands include the word sebaceous meaning consisting of sebum was first termed in 1728 and comes from the latin for tallow  sebaceous glands have been documented since at least 1746 by jean astruc who defined them as the glands which separate the fat   he describes them in the oral cavity on the head eyelids and ears as universally acknowledged   viii astruc describes them being blocked by small animals that are implanted in the excretory ducts   and attributes their presence in the oral cavity to apthous ulcers noting these glands naturally secrete a viscous humour which puts on various colours and consistencies in its natural state is very mild balsamic and intended to wet and lubricate the mouth    in the principles of physiology 1834 a combe noted that the glands were not present in the palms of the hands or soles of the feet  the preputial glands of mice and rats are large modified sebaceous glands that produce pheromones used for territorial marking  these and the scent glands in the flanks of hamsters have a similar composition to human sebaceous glands are androgen responsive and have been used as a basis for study  sebaceous adenitis is an autoimmune disease affecting the sebaceous gland known mainly to occur in dogs particularly poodles and akitas where it is thought to be generally autosomal recessively inherited it has also been described in cats and one report describes this condition in a rabbit in these animals it is a cause of hair loss

V nancy scheperhughes born 1944 new york city is a professor of anthropology and director of the program in medical anthropology at the university of california at berkeley  she is known for her writing on the anthropology of the body hunger illness medicine psychiatry madness social suffering violence and genocide in 2009 her investigation of an international ring of organ sellers based in new york new jersey and israel led to a number of arrests by the fbi   scheperhughes first book saints scholars and schizophrenics mental illness in rural ireland 1979 was a study of madness among bachelor farmers and won the margaret mead award from the society for applied anthropology in 1980 the book established scheperhughes ability to provoke controversy through her writing especially in ireland many readers took umbrage at her portrayal of the disintegration of rural irish family life due to the collapse of the agrarian economy in the 20th anniversary edition of the book scheperhughes provided an update on the transitions the community was undergoing at the time of her original research she also discussed the challenges and ethics of ethnography issues that are pushed to the fore as anthropologists increasingly work in communities that can read and critique their work in her subsequent book death without weeping the violence of everyday life in brazil 1993 she discusses the violence between mothers refusing to care for their sickly children once again her work had many critics both inside and outside brazil given its depiction of women forced by horrific circumstances to ration their love and favor towards infants and toddlers who seemed to have the best chance of survival and even more controversial her description of mothers collaborating and hastening the deaths of infants thought to be lacking a will desejo a knack jeito or a taste gosto for life death without weeping has become something of a classic within the field of medical anthropology  in addition to her fulllength monographs scheperhughes has published on aidshiv in brazil and cuba human rights death squads apartheid and shanty town violence in south africa and sexual abuse in the catholic church coining or popularizing such terms as the mindful body 1987 with margaret lock political economy of the emotions 1993a life boat ethics 1993b neocannibalism 2001 sexual citizenship 1994b the genocidal continuum militant anthropology and anthropology with its feet on the ground 1995 one of the central themes unifying scheperhughes scholarship is how violence comes to mark the bodies of the vulnerable poor and disenfranchised with a terrifying intimacy her work in latin america south africa ireland and eastern europe traces the insidious invisibility of everyday violence which often makes the vulnerable and exploited into their own wardens and executioners  besides her own original research she has helped disseminate the work of scholars such as radical italian psychiatrist franco basaglia brazilian educator paulo freire and the brazilian physician and radical ecologist josué de castro to a wider north american audience  scheperhughes served as a peace corps volunteer in brazil in the 1960s she has worked as an activist and with social movements in brazil in defense of rural workers against death squads and for the rights of street children in the united states as a civil rights worker and as a catholic worker  for the homeless mentally ill against nuclear weapons research at the lawrence livermore national laboratory  and internationally in defense of the rights of those who sell their kidneys in 1999 scheperhughes joined with three other professors to launch organs watch an organization dedicated to research on the global traffic in human organs tracking the movements of people and organs around the globe as well as the global inequities that facilitate this trade   in october 2008 she appeared on the bbc program hardtalk  expressing her strong opposition to the open free buying and selling of organs even if there were government oversight through regulation her reason for this position is that she feels it will eventually corrupt the entire field because of the inevitability of brokers engaging in satisfying the demands of wealthy buyers for higher quality donors she is opposed to the iranian governments regulated organ donor program involving cash rewards and predicts it will fail her preference is for free voluntary donations from family or friends she has characterized the efforts of patients waiting for an organ transplant to save their lives through purchasing a replacement organ from a volunteer as just a new form of commodity fetishism  she deplores the fact that to the dying patients waiting for a transplant in the late or postmodern consumeroriented context the ancient prescription for virtue in suffering and grace in dying can only appear patently absurd  she recommends instead that the now lethally long waiting lists for organ transplants be trimmed by questioning the rights of infants and those over 70 to be on the waiting list  however in 2010 nancy scheperhughes already supported legal compensation for organ donations she also says that compensations are already paid in the dont ask dont tell sense behind this lies the desperation due to shortage of organ donations

V neuromodulation is the physiological process by which a given neuron uses one or more neurotransmitters to regulate diverse populations of neurons this is in contrast to classical synaptic transmission in which one presynaptic neuron directly influences a single postsynaptic partner neuromodulators secreted by a small group of neurons diffuse through large areas of the nervous system affecting multiple neurons major neuromodulators in the central nervous system include dopamine serotonin acetylcholine histamine and norepinephrine neuromodulation can be conceptualized as a neurotransmitter that is not reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron or broken down into a metabolite such neuromodulators end up spending a significant amount of time in the cerebrospinal fluid csf influencing or modulating the activity of several other neurons in the brain for this reason some neurotransmitters are also considered to be neuromodulators such as serotonin and acetylcholine  neuromodulation is often contrasted with classical fast synaptic transmission in both cases the transmitter acts on local postsynaptic receptors but in neuromodulation the receptors are typically gprotein coupled receptors while in classical chemical neurotransmission they are ligandgated ion channels neurotransmission that involves metabotropic receptors like gprotein linked receptors often also involves voltagegated ion channels and is relatively slow conversely neurotransmission that involves exclusively ligandgated ion channels is much faster a related distinction is also sometimes drawn between modulator and driver synaptic inputs to a neuron but here the emphasis is on modulating ongoing neuronal spiking versus causing that spiking   neuromodulators may alter the output of a physiological system by acting on the associated inputs for instance central pattern generators however modeling work suggests that this alone is insufficient  because the neuromuscular transformation from neural input to muscular output may be tuned for particular ranges of input stern et al 2007 suggest that neuromodulators must act not only on the input system but must change the transformation itself to produce the proper contractions of muscles as output  neurotransmitter systems are systems of neurons in the brain expressing certain types of neurotransmitters and thus form distinct systems activation of the system causes effects in large volumes of the brain called volume transmission volume transmission is the diffusion through the brain extracellular fluid of neurotransmitters released at points that may be remote from the target cells with the resulting activation of extrasynaptic receptors and with a longer time course than for transmission at a single synapse  the major neurotransmitter systems are the noradrenaline norepinephrine system the dopamine system the serotonin system and the cholinergic system drugs targeting the neurotransmitter of such systems affects the whole system and explains the mode of action of many drugs most other neurotransmitters on the other hand eg glutamate gaba and glycine are used very generally throughout the central nervous system further reading norepinephrinenorepinephrine system the noradrenaline system consists of just 1500 neurons on each side of the brain primarily in the locus coeruleus this is diminutive compared to the more than 100 billion neurons in the brain as with dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra neurons in the locus caeruleus tend to be melaninpigmented in spite of their small number when activated the system plays major roles in the brain as seen in table above noradrenaline is released from the neurons and acts on adrenergic receptors further reading dopaminefunctions in the brain the dopamine or dopaminergic system consists of several pathways originating from the ventral tegmentum or substantia nigra as examples it acts on dopamine receptors parkinsons disease is at least in part related to dropping out of dopaminergic cells in deepbrain nuclei primarily the melaninpigmented neurons in the substantia nigra but secondarily the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus treatments potentiating the effect of dopamine precursors have been proposed and effected with moderate success further reading serotoningross anatomy the serotonin created by the brain comprises around 10 of total body serotonin the majority 8090 is found in the gastrointestinal gi tract  it travels around the brain along the medial forebrain bundle and acts on serotonin receptors in the peripheral nervous system such as in the gut wall serotonin regulates vascular tone gammaaminobutyric acid gaba has an inhibitory effect on brain and spinal cord activity  neuromodulation also refers to an emerging class of medical therapies that target the nervous system for restoration of function such as in cochlear implants relief of pain or control of symptoms such as tremor seen in movement disorders like parkinsons disease the therapies consist primarily of targeted electrical stimulation or infusion of medications into the cerebrospinal fluid using intrathecal drug delivery such as baclofen for spasticity electrical stimulation devices include deep brain stimulation systems dbs colloquially referred to as brain pacemakers spinal cord stimulators scs which are implanted using minimally invasive procedures or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices which are fully external among others

V sweat glands also known as sudoriferous or sudoriparous glands from latin sudor meaning sweat   are small tubular structures of the skin that produce sweat sweat glands are a type of exocrine gland which are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct there are two main types of sweat glands that differ in their structure function secretory product mechanism of excretion anatomic distribution and distribution across species ceruminous glands which produce ear wax mammary glands which produce milk and ciliary glands in the eyelids are modified apocrine sweat glands     generally sweat glands consist of a secretory unit consisting of a base rolled into a glomerulum and a duct that carries the sweat away  the secretory coil or base is set deep in the lower dermis and hypodermis and the entire gland is surrounded by adipose tissue    in both sweat gland types the secretory coils are surrounded by contractile myoepithelial cells that function to facilitate excretion of secretory product   the secretory activities of the gland cells and the contractions of myoepithelial cells are controlled by both the autonomic nervous system and by the circulating hormones the distal or apical part of the duct that opens to the skins surface is known as the acrosyringium  each sweat gland receives several nerve fibers that branch out into bands of one or more axons and encircle the individual tubules of the secretory coil capillaries are also interwoven among sweat tubules  the number of active sweat glands varies greatly among different people though comparisons between different areas ex axillae vs groin show the same directional changes certain areas always have more active sweat glands while others always have fewer  according to henry grays estimates the palm has around 370 sweat glands per cm  the back of the hand has 200 per cm  the forehead has 175 per cm  the breast abdomen and forearm have 155 per cm  and the back and legs have 6080 per cm   in the finger pads sweat glands are somewhat irregularly spaced on the epidermal ridges there are no pores between the ridges though sweat tends to spill into them  the thick epidermis of the palms and soles causes the sweat glands to become spirally coiled  nonprimate mammals have eccrine sweat glands only on the palms and soles apocrine glands cover the rest of the body though they are not as effective as humans in temperature regulation with the exception of horses  prosimians have a 120 ratio of follicles with apocrine glands versus follicles without  they have eccrine glands between hairs over most of their body while humans have them between the hairs on their scalp  the overall distribution of sweat glands varies among primates the rhesus and patas monkeys have them on the chest the squirrel monkey has them only on the palms and soles and the stumptailed macaque japanese monkey and baboon have them over the entire body  domestic animals  have apocrine glands at the base of each hair follicle but eccrine glands only in foot pads and snout their apocrine glands like those in humans produce an odorless oily milky secretion evolved not to evaporate and cool but rather coat and stick to hair so odorcausing bacteria can grow on it  eccrine glands on their foot pads like those on palms and soles of humans did not evolve to cool either but rather increase friction and enhance grip dogs and cats have apocrine glands that are specialized in both structure and function located at the eyelids molls glands ears ceruminous glands anal sac prepuce vulva and circumanal area  apocrine sweat glands are found in the armpit areola around the nipples perineum between the anus and genitals in the ear and in the eyelids the secretory portion is larger than that of eccrine glands making them larger overall rather than opening directly onto the surface of the skin apocrine glands secrete sweat into the pilary canal of the hair follicle  before puberty the apocrine sweat glands are inactive  hormonal changes in puberty cause the glands to increase in size and begin functioning  the substance secreted is thicker than eccrine sweat and provides nutrients for bacteria on the skin the bacterias decomposition of sweat is what creates the acrid odor  apocrine sweat glands are most active in times of stress and sexual excitement  in mammals including humans apocrine sweat contains pheromonelike compounds to attract other organisms within their species study of human sweat has revealed differences between men and women in apocrine secretions and bacteria  eccrine sweat glands are everywhere except the lips ear canal prepuce glans penis labia minora and clitoris they are ten times smaller than apocrine sweat glands do not extend as deeply into the dermis and excrete directly onto the surface of the skin     the proportion of eccrine glands decreases with age  the clear secretion produced by eccrine sweat glands is termed sweat or sensible perspiration sweat is mostly water but it does contain some electrolytes since it is derived from blood plasma the presence of sodium chloride gives sweat a salty taste the total volume of sweat produced depends on the number of functional glands and the size of the surface opening the degree of secretory activity is regulated by neural and hormonal mechanisms men sweat more than women when all of the eccrine sweat glands are working at maximum capacity the rate of perspiration for a human being may exceed three liters per hour  and dangerous losses of fluids and electrolytes can occur eccrine glands have three primary functions some human sweat glands cannot be classified as either apocrine or eccrine having characteristics of both such glands are termed apoeccrine  they are larger than eccrine glands but smaller than apocrine ones  their secretory portion has a narrow portion similar to secretory coils in eccrine glands as well as a wide section reminiscent of apocrine glands  apoeccrine found in the armpits and perianal region have ducts opening onto the skin surface  they are presumed to have developed in puberty from the eccrine glands  and can comprise up to 50 of all axillary glands apoeccrine glands secrete more sweat than both eccrine and apocrine glands thus playing a large role in axillary sweating  apoeccrine glands are sensitive to cholinergic activity though they can also be activated via adrenergic stimulation  like eccrine glands they continuously secrete a thin watery sweat  specialized sweat glands including the ceruminous glands mammary glands ciliary glands of the eyelids and sweat glands of the nasal vestibulum are modified apocrine glands   ceruminous glands are near the ear canals and produce cerumen earwax that mixes with the oil secreted from sebaceous glands   mammary glands use apocrine secretion to produce milk  sweat glands are used to regulate temperature and remove waste by secreting water sodium salts and nitrogenous waste such as urea onto the skin surface   the main electrolytes of sweat are sodium and chloride  though the amount is small enough to make sweat hypotonic at the skin surface  eccrine sweat is clear odorless and is composed of 9899 water it also contains nacl fatty acids lactic acid citric acid ascorbic acid urea and uric acid its ph ranges from 4 to 68  on the other hand the apocrine sweat has a ph of 6 to 75 it contains water proteins carbohydrate waste material lipids and steroids the sweat is oily cloudy viscous and originally odorless  it gains odor upon decomposition by bacteria because both apocrine glands and sebaceous glands open into the hair follicle apocrine sweat is mixed with sebum  it was originally thought that both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands used merocrine secretion where vesicles in the gland released sweat via exocytosis leaving the entire cell intact   more recent studies have revealed that apocrine glands release sweat in the hair follicle via apocrine secretion where portions of the cell are actually pinched off and disintegrate later to excrete sweat   in both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands the sweat is originally produced in the glands coil where it is isotonic with the blood plasma there  when the rate of sweating is low salt is conserved and reabsorbed by the glands duct high sweat rates on the other hand lead to less salt reabsorption and allow more water to evaporate on the skin via osmosis to increase evaporative cooling  secretion of sweat occurs when the myoepithelial cell cells surrounding the secretory glands contract  eccrine sweat increases the rate of bacterial growth and volatilizes the odor compounds of apocrine sweat strengthening the latters acrid smell  normally only a certain number of sweat glands are actively producing sweat when stimuli call for more sweating more sweat glands are activated with each then producing more sweat   both eccrine and apocrine sweat glands participate in thermal thermoregulatory sweating  which is directly controlled by the hypothalamus thermal sweating is stimulated by a combination of internal body temperature and mean skin temperature  in eccrine sweat glands stimulation occurs via activation by acetylcholine which binds to the glands muscarinic receptors  emotional sweating is stimulated by stress anxiety fear and pain it is independent of ambient temperature acetylcholine acts on the eccrine glands and adrenaline acts on both eccrine and apocrine glands to produce sweat  emotional sweating can occur anywhere though it is most evident on the palms soles of the feet and axillary regions  sweating on the palms and soles is thought to have evolved as a fleeing reaction in mammals it increases friction and prevents slipping when running or climbing in stressful situations  gustatory sweating refers to thermal sweating induced by the ingestion of food the increase in metabolism caused by ingestion raises body temperature leading to thermal sweating hot and spicy foods also leads to mild gustatory sweating in the face scalp and neck capsaicin the compound that makes spicy food taste hot binds to receptors in the mouth that detect warmth the increased stimulation of such receptors induces a thermoregulatory response  unlike deodorant which simply reduces axillary odor without affecting body functions antiperspirant reduces both eccrine and apocrine sweating   antiperspirants which are classified as drugs cause proteins to precipitate and mechanically block eccrine and sometimes apocrine sweat ducts  the metal salts found in antiperspirants alters the keratin fibrils in the ducts the ducts then close and form a horny plug the main active ingredients in modern antiperspirants are aluminum chloride aluminum chlorohydrate aluminum zirconium chlorohydrate and buffered aluminum sulfate  on apocrine glands antiperspirants also contain antibacterial agents such as trichlorocarbanilide hexamethylene tetramine and zinc ricinoleate   the salts are dissolved in ethanol and mixed with essential oils high in eugenol and thymol such as thyme and clove oils antiperspirants may also contain levomethamphetamine  diseases of the sweat glands include sweat gland tumors include  adenolipomas are lipomas associated with eccrine sweat glands  many diseases cause sweat gland dysfunction

V the visible part of the human nose is the protruding part of the face that bears the nostrils the shape of the nose is determined by the nasal bones and the nasal cartilages including the septal cartilage which separates the nostrils and the upper and lower lateral cartilages on average the nose of a male is larger than that of a female  the nose has an area of specialised cells which are responsible for smelling part of the olfactory system another function of the nose is the conditioning of inhaled air warming it and making it more humid hairs inside the nose prevent large particles from entering the lungs sneezing is usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal mucosa but can more rarely be caused by sudden exposure to bright light called the photic sneeze reflex or touching the external auditory canal sneezing can transmit infections because it creates aerosols in which the droplets can harbour microbes   the nasal root is the top of the nose forming an indentation at the suture where the nasal bones meet the frontal bone the anterior nasal spine is the thin projection of bone at the midline on the lower nasal margin holding the cartilaginous center of the nose  adult humans have nasal hairs in the anterior nasal passage one of the most common medical conditions involving the nose are nosebleeds in medicine epistaxis most of them occur in kiesselbachs area synonym littles area nasal congestion is a common symptom of infections or other inflammations of the nasal lining rhinitis such as in allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis resulting from nasal spray abuse most of these conditions also cause anosmia which is the medical term for a loss of smell this may also occur in other conditions for example following trauma in kallmann syndrome or parkinsons disease the nose is a common site of foreign bodies the nose is susceptible to frostbite nasal flaring is a sign of respiratory distress that involves widening of the nostrils on inspiration because of the special nature of the blood supply to the human nose and surrounding area it is possible for retrograde infections from the nasal area to spread to the brain for this reason the area from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose including the nose and maxilla is known to doctors as the danger triangle of the face specific systemic diseases infections or other conditions that may result in destruction of part of the nose for example the nasal bridge or nasal septal perforation are rhinophyma skin cancer for example basal cell carcinoma granulomatosis with polyangiitis systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis tuberculosis syphilis leprosy and exposure to cocaine chromium or toxins the nose may be stimulated to grow in acromegaly some people choose to get rhinoplasty to change the aesthetic appearance of their nose nose piercings are also common such as nostril septum or bridge in new zealand nose pressing hongi is a traditional greeting amongst maori people however it is now generally confined to certain traditional celebrations the hanazuka monument enshrines the mutilated noses of at least 38000 koreans killed during the japanese invasions of korea from 1592 to 1598  the septal cartilage of the nose can be destroyed through repeated nasal inhalation of drugs such as cocaine this in turn can lead to more widespread collapse of the nasal skeleton nosepicking is a common mildly taboo habit medical risks include the spread of infections nosebleeds and rarely selfinduced perforation of the nasal septum the wiping of the nose with the hand commonly referred to as the allergic salute is also mildly taboo and can result in the spreading of infections as well habitual as well as fast or rough nose wiping may also result in a crease known as a transverse nasal crease or groove running across the nose and can lead to permanent physical deformity observable in childhood and adulthood   nose fetishism or nasophilia is the sexual fetish or paraphilia for the nose the psychiatric condition of extreme nose picking is termed rhinotillexomania antisemitic propaganda often portrays jewish people as having jewish noses large and hooked  the term jewish nose is controversial  in china and some other locations in east asia westerners caucasians are often designated as having big or high noses due to the differences in shape and proportion between noses typical of caucasians and those typical of chinese  clive finlayson of the gibraltar museum said the large neanderthal noses were an adaption to the cold  todd c rae of the american museum of natural history said primate and arctic animal studies have shown sinus size reduction in areas of extreme cold rather than enlargement in accordance with allens rule  therefore todd c rae concludes that the design of the large and prognathic neanderthal nose was evolved for the hotter climate of the middle east and was kept when the neanderthals entered europe  miquel hernández of the department of animal biology at the university of barcelona said the high and narrow nose of eskimos and neanderthals is an adaption to a cold and dry environment since it contributes to warming and moisturizing the air and the recovery of heat and moisture from expired air  an article published in the speculative journal medical hypotheses suggested that the nose is an alteration of the angle of skull following human skeletal changes due to bipedalism this changed the shape of the skull base causing together with change in diet a knockon morphological reduction in the relative size of the maxillary and mandible and through this a squeezing of the protrusion of the most anterior parts of the face more forward and so increasing nose prominence and modifying its shape  the aquatic ape hypothesis relates the nose to a hypothesized period of aquatic adaptation in which the downwardfacing nostrils and flexible philtrum prevented water from entering the nasal cavities  the theory is not generally accepted by mainstream scholars of human evolution  stephen jay gould has noted that larger noses are less neotenous especially the large grecian nose  women have smaller noses than men due to not having increased secretion of testosterone in adolescence  and smaller noses are considered more attractive on women  werner syndrome a condition that causes the appearance of premature aging causes a birdlike appearance due to pinching of the nose  while conversely down syndrome a neotenizing condition  causes flattening of the nose

V johnstons organ is a collection of sensory cells found in the pedicel the second segment of the antennae in the class insecta  johnstons organ detects motion in the flagellum third and typically final antennal segment it consists of scolopidia arrayed in a bowl shape each of which contains a mechanosensory chordotonal neuron   the number of scolopidia varies between species in homopterans the johnstons organs contain 25  79 scolopidia  the presence of johnstons organ is a defining characteristic which separates the class insecta from the other hexapods belonging to the group entognatha johnstons organ was named after the physician christopher johnston  father of the physician and assyriologist christopher johnston   in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster the johnstons organ contains almost 480 sensory neurons  distinct populations of neurons are activated differently by deflections of antennae caused by gravity or by vibrations caused by sound or air movement this differential response allows the fly to distinguish between gravitational mechanical and acoustic stimuli   the johnstons organ of fruit flies can be used to detect air vibrations caused by the wingbeat frequency or courtship song of a mate one function of the johnstons organ is for detecting the wing beat frequency of a mate  production of sound in air results in two energy components the pressure component which is changes in air pressure emanating away from the source of the sound and the particle displacement component which is the back and forth vibration of air particles oscillating in the direction of sound propagation  particle displacement has greater energy loss than the pressure component so the displacement component called nearfield sound is detectable only within one wavelength of the source  insects such as fruit flies and bees detect near field sounds using loosely attached hairs or antennae which vibrate with air particle movement  tympanal organs detect the pressure component of sound nearfield sound because of the rapid dissipation of energy is suitable only for very close communication  two examples of nearfield sound communication are bees waggle dance and drosophila courtship songs  in fruit flies the arista of the antennae and the third segment act as the sound receiver  vibrations of the receiver cause rotation of the third segment which channels sound input to the mechanoreceptors of the johnstons organ  the johnstons organ plays a role in the control of flight stability in hawk moths kinematic data measured from hovering moths during steady flight indicate that the antennae vibrate with a frequency matching wingbeat 27hz during complex flight however angular changes of the flying moth cause coriolis forces which are predicted to manifest as a vibration of the antenna of at about twice wingbeat frequency 60hz when antennae were manipulated to vibrate at a range of frequencies and the resulting signals from the neurons associated with the johnstons organs were measured the response of the scolopidia neurons to the frequency was tightly coupled in the range of 5070hz which is the predicted range of vibrations caused by coriolis effects thus the johnstons organ is tuned to detect angular changes during maneuvering in complex flight  dancing honeybees apis mellifera describe the location of nearby food sources by emitted airborne sound signals these signals consist of rhythmic highvelocity movement of air particles these near field sounds are received and interpreted using the johnstons organ in the pedicel of the antennae  honeybees also perceive electric field changes via the johnstons organs in their antennae and possibly other mechanoreceptors electric fields generated by movements of the wings cause displacements of the antennae based on coulombs law neurons of the johnstons organ respond to movements within the range of displacements caused by electric fields when the antennae were prevented from moving at the joints containing the johnstons organ bees no longer responded to biologically relevant electric fields honeybees respond differently to different temporal patterns honeybees appear to use the electric field emanating from the dancing bee for distance communication

V a liver injury is some form of trauma sustained to the liver this can occur through either a blunt force such as a car accident or a penetrating foreign object such as a knife  liver injuries constitute 5 of all traumas making it the most common abdominal injury  generally nonoperative management and observation is all that is required for a full recovery   given its anterior position in the abdominal cavity and its large size it is prone to gun shot wounds and stab wounds  its firm location under the diaphragm also makes it especially prone to shearing forces  common causes of this type of injury are blunt force mechanisms such as motor vehicle accidents falls and sports injuries typically these blunt forces dissipate through and around the structure of the liver  a large majority of people who sustain this injury also have another accompanying injury  imaging such as the use of ultrasound or a computed tomography scan is the generally preferred way of diagnosis as it is more accurate and is sensitive to bleeding however due to logistics this is not always possible  for a person who is hemodynamically unstable a focused assessment with sonography for trauma fast scan may take place which is used to find free floating fluid in the right upper quadrant and left lower quadrant of the abdomen a physical examination may be used but is typically inaccurate in blunt trauma unlike in penetrating trauma where the trajectory the projectile took can be followed digitally  a diagnostic peritoneal lavage dpl may also be utilized but has limited application as it is hard to determine the origin of the bleeding  liver injuries are classified on a roman numeral scale with i being the least severe to vi being the most severe generally any injury iii requires surgery   the initial management of liver trauma generally follows the same procedures for all traumas with a focus on maintaining airway breathing and circulation a physical examination is a corner stone of the assessment of which there are various noninvasive means of diagnostic tools that can be utilized  an invasive diagnostic peritoneal lavage can also be used to diagnose and classify the extent of the damage   a large majority of liver injuries are minor and require only observation  generally if there is estimated to be less than 300ml of free floating fluid no injury to surrounding organs and no need for blood transfusion there is a low risk of complication from nonoperative management  in special cases where there is a higher risk with surgery such as in the elderly nonoperative management would include the infusion of packed red blood cells in an intensive care unit  typically hepatic injuries resulting from stab wounds cause little damage unless a vital part of the liver is injured such as the hepatic portal vein with gunshot wounds the damage is worse  in severe liver injuries class iii surgical correction is generally necessary in these severe injuries a hepatopancreatobiliary surgeon may be utilized rather than a trauma surgeon given their expertise with the organ and generally yields better outcomes  surgical techniques such as perihepatic packing or the use of the pringle manoeuvre can be used to control hemorrhage   temporary control of the hemorrhage can be direct manual pressure to the wound site  in these severe cases it is important to prevent the progression of the trauma triad of death which often requires the utilization of damage control surgery  the common cause of death while operating is exsanguination caused by profuse loss of blood volume  rarely surgery entails the use of liver resection which removes the source of the bleeding and necrotic tissue the drastic nature of this procedure means it can only be used in hemodynamically stable patients  another rare procedure would be liver transplantation which is typically impractical due to the logistics of finding a proper organ donor in a timely fashion  in the 1880s a severe liver injury would in most cases prove fatal in the first 24 hours after sustaining the injury  before the 1980s nonoperative management was seldom used in favor of the methods of management suggested by james hogarth pringle   during world war ii the use of early laparotomy was popularized and in conjunction with the use of transfusions advanced anesthetics and other new surgical techniques led to decreased mortality

V in the flowering plants an ovary is a part of the female reproductive organ of the flower or gynoecium specifically it is the part of the pistil which holds the ovules and is located above or below or at the point of connection with the base of the petals and sepals the pistil may be made up of one carpel or of several fused carpels eg tricarpel and therefore the ovary can contain part of one carpel or parts of several fused carpels above the ovary is the style and the stigma which is where the pollen lands and germinates to grow down through the style to the ovary and for each individual pollen grain to fertilize one individual ovule some wind pollinated flowers have much reduced and modified ovaries   a fruit is the ripened ovary or ovariestogether with seedsfrom one or more flowers the fruits of a plant are responsible for dispersing the seeds that contain the embryo and protecting the seeds as well in many species the fruit incorporates some surrounding tissues or is dispersed with some nonfruit tissues locules are chambers within the ovary of the flower and fruits the locules contain the ovules seeds and may or may not be filled with fruit flesh depending on the number of locules in the ovary fruits can be classified as unilocular unilocular bilocular trilocular or multilocular some plants have septa between the carpels the number of locules present in a gynoecium may be equal to or less than the number of carpels depending on whether septa are present the ovules are attached to parts of the interior ovary walls called the placentae placental areas occur in various positions corresponding to various parts of the carpels that make up the ovary see ovulelocationwithintheplant an obturator is present in the ovary of some plants near the micropyle of each ovule it is an outgrowth of the placenta important in nourishing and guiding pollen tubes to the micropyle  the ovary of some types of fruit is dehiscent the ovary wall splits into sections called valves there is no standard correspondence between the valves and the position of the septa the valves may separate by splitting the septa septicidal dehiscence or by spitting between them loculicidal dehiscence or the ovary may open in other ways such as through pores or because a cap falls off the syncarpous ovary of this melon is made up of four carpels and has one locule the ovary of a fruit has split into valves the seeds in a tomato fruit grow from placental areas at the interior of the ovary this is axile placentation in a bilocular fruit the placentae in lunaria are along the margins of the fruit where two carpels fuse this is parietal placentation in a bilocular fruit the valves of lunaria fruit fall to reveal a septum that was between the two carpels of the ovary the terminology of the positions of ovaries is determined by the insertion point where the other floral parts perianth and androecium come together and attach to the surface of the ovary  if the ovary is situated above the insertion point it is superior if below inferior a superior ovary is an ovary attached to the receptacle above the attachment of other floral parts a superior ovary is found in types of fleshy fruits such as true berries drupes etc a flower with this arrangement is described as hypogynous an example is hypericum calycinum a halfinferior ovary also known as halfsuperior subinferior or partially inferior is embedded or surrounded by the receptacle  this occurs in flowers of the lythraceae family which includes the crape myrtles such flowers are termed perigynous or halfepigynous in some classifications halfinferior ovaries are not recognized and are instead grouped with either the superior or inferior ovaries an inferior ovary lies below the attachment of other floral parts a pome is a type of fleshy fruit that is often cited as an example but close inspection of some pomes such as pyracantha will show that it is really a halfinferior ovary flowers with inferior ovaries are termed epigynous some examples of flowers with an inferior ovary are orchids inferior capsule fuchsia inferior berry asteraceae inferior achenelike fruit called a cypsela more specifically a halfinferior ovary has nearly equal portions of ovary above and below the insertion point other varying degrees of inferiority can be described by other fractions for instance a onefifth inferior ovary has approximately one fifth of its length under the insertion point likewise only one quarter portion of a threequarters inferior ovary is above the insertion

V in animal anatomy a cloaca klo\u028a\u02c8e\u026ak\u0259 is the posterior orifice that serves as the only opening for the intestinal reproductive and urinary tracts of certain animals opening at the vent all amphibians birds reptiles and a few mammals monotremes tenrecs golden moles and marsupial moles have this orifice from which they excrete both urine and feces this is in contrast to most placental mammals which have two or three separate orifices for evacuation excretory systems with analogous purpose in certain invertebrates are also sometimes referred to as cloacae the cloacal region is also often associated with a secretory organ the cloacal gland which has been implicated in the scentmarking behavior of some reptiles amphibians and monotremes   the word comes from latin and means sewer derived from clu\u014d which meant cleanse birds reproduce using their cloaca this occurs during a cloacal kiss in most birds birds that mate using this method touch their cloacae together in some species for only a few seconds sufficient time for sperm to be transferred from the male to the female  the reproductive system must be reengorged prior to the mating season of each species such regeneration usually takes about a month birds generally produce one batch of eggs per year but they will produce another if the first is taken away for some birds such as ostriches cassowaries kiwi geese and some species of swans and ducks the males do not use the cloaca for reproduction but have a phallus in those the penis helps ensure water does not wash away the males sperm during copulation  one study  has looked into birds that use their cloaca for cooling see urohydrosis  among fish a true cloaca is present only in elasmobranchs sharks and rays and lobefinned fishes in lampreys and in some rayfinned fishes part of the cloaca remains in the adult to receive the urinary and reproductive ducts although the anus always opens separately in chimaeras and most teleosts however all three openings are entirely separated  with a few exceptions noted below mammals have no cloaca even in those that have one the cloaca is partially subdivided into separate regions for the anus and urethra the monotremes egglaying mammals possess a true cloaca in marsupials and a few birds the genital tract is separate from the anus but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally  this is one of the features of marsupials and monotremes that suggest their basal nature as the amniotes from which mammals evolved possessed a cloaca and the earliest animals to diverge into the mammalian class would most likely have had this feature too unlike other marsupials marsupial moles have a true cloaca  a fact that has been argued against a marsupial identity for these mammals   most adult placental mammals have no remaining trace of the cloaca in the embryo the embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus and an anterior region that has different fates depending on the sex of the individual in females it develops into the vestibule that receives the urethra and vagina while in males it forms the entirety of the penile urethra  however the tenrecs and golden moles small placental mammals native to africa as well as some shrews retain a cloaca as adults  being placental animals humans only have an embryonic cloaca which is split up into separate tracts during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs however a few human congenital disorders result in persons being born with a cloaca including persistent cloaca and sirenomelia mermaid syndrome some species have modified cloacae for increased gas exchange see reptile respiration this is where reproductive activity occurs some turtles especially those specialized in diving are highly reliant on cloacal respiration during dives  they accomplish this by having a pair of accessory air bladders connected to the cloaca which can absorb oxygen from the water  various fish as well as polychaete worms and even crabs are specialized to take advantage of the constant flow of water through the cloacal respiratory tree of sea cucumbers while simultaneously gaining the protection of living within the sea cucumber itself at night many of these species emerge from the anus of the sea cucumber in search of food

V bionic contact lenses are being developed to provide a virtual display that could have a variety of uses from assisting the visually impaired to the video game industry  the device will have the form of a conventional contact lens with added bionics technology in the form of augmented reality  with functional electronic circuits and infrared lights to create a virtual display  babak parviz a university of washington assistant professor of electrical engineering is quoted as saying looking through a completed lens you would see what the display is generating superimposed on the world outside    there are certain technical requirements that engineers have to meet in order to develop safe bionic lenses first power must be provided to bionic lenses via wireless mediums second bionic lenses have to be biocompatible these requirements challenge engineers by limiting their material choice and imposing a regulatory standard regarding radiofrequency radiation so as not to harm the user third microscale components should be mechanically and electrically integrated on a polymer substrate and finally all of these operations have to be completed within the volume of standard contact lenses that being 1cm² in area with a thickness of 200 \u03bcm or smaller an antenna on the lens picks up a radio frequency   the integrated circuit transforms and stores this energy chips harvest this energy and convert it into voltage that is necessary to power the leds the leds create an image and fresnel lenses are used to project the generated image onto the retina  the main function of the antenna is to pick up radio frequency energy transmitted by an outlying source antenna design is influenced by physical constraints rather than efficiency concerns because antennas have to fit the lens and be compatible with the eye physiology an antenna with 5mm radius 05mm width and 50 \u03bcm thickness was designed to harvest rf energy  the antenna design is the main determinant of the amount of power that can be received with the current antenna design there is only a small amount of power available for the bionic lens as the distance between the contact lens and the transmitting antenna decreases more power is available due to near field interactions the electronic circuits are a few nanometers thick and they are used for power harvesting and led control  selfassembly is a microfabrication technique that is widely used where microscale fabrication is necessary and where there is a delicate substrate in bionic lens production it is used to position the electrical circuit components in their respective locations within the lens electrical components are initially sprinkled onto a sheet of flexible plastic the shape of each tiny component determines the location to which it can be attached capillary forces do the rest of the job to position each component in its location  the chip harvests energy and transforms it into voltage that is necessary to power the led the current working prototype consists of a transparent sapphire chip that contains a customdesigned microlight emitting diode with peak emission at 475nm  leds are the core technology behind the bionic lens because they form images in front of the eye whether they are in the form of words charts or photographs current led chips measure 300 nanometers in diameter while the light emitting zone on each chip is a 60 nanometers wide ring with a radius of 112 nanometers lightemitting diodes are onethird of a millimeter while red leds were previously used for prototype development currently blue leds are preferred to achieve a full color display gan and its alloys are also preferred due to their nontoxicity high efficiency and emission wavelength microled design with a peak intensity of approximately 475nm is achieved and it is adequate to illuminate the retina  the minimum focal distance of the human eye doesnt enable images generated by the leds to reach the retina from the bionic lens even though the human eye has a minimum focal distance of several centimeters it is not capable of resolving objects on a lens micro lenses provide a solution to this challenge a micro lens is a lens with a diameter as small as 10 micrometers it can be fabricated on a plastic substrate these lenses have diffraction and reflection propertiesand different focal lengthsand these various functionalities can be used to address different design challenges fresnel lenses are a fundamental part of the bionic lens design since they address the problem of focusing an image to the retina they are a class of micro lenses with a distinctive focusing property they can easily be fabricated on substrates and they can be structured to have a short focal length led output is successfully reflected to the retina in this singlepixel wireless contact lens  the lens itself consists of polyethylene terephthalate pet this material is suitable especially for bionic lenses because of its good chemical resistance and thermal stability during photolithography and transparency the antenna electrical interconnections electrical isolation and pads for solder coating are directly manufactured on the contact lens  harvey ho a former graduate student of parviz who worked at sandia national laboratories in livermore california presented the results in january 2008 at the institute of electrical and electronics engineers international conference on micro electro mechanical systems or microbotics in tucson arizona  the lens is expected to have more electronics and capabilities on the areas where the eye does not see wireless communication radio frequency power transmission and solar cells are expected in future developments  in 2013 scientists created and successfully tested a functioning prototype with a wireless antenna and a singlepixel display  previous prototypes proved that it is possible to create a biologically safe electronic lens that does not obstruct a persons view engineers have tested the finished lenses on rabbits for up to 20 minutes and the animals showed no problems

V breast development is a complex biological process in primates that takes place throughout a females life it occurs across several phases including prenatal development puberty and pregnancy at menopause breast development ceases and the breasts atrophy breast development results in prominent and developed structures on the chest known as breasts in primates which serve as both a sexual characteristic and as mammary glands the process is mediated by an assortment of hormones and growth factors the most important of which include estrogen progesterone prolactin growth hormone and insulinlike growth factor 1 the tanner scale right is often used as a reference for the stages of pubertal breast development in girls   the master regulators of breast development are the steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone growth hormone gh mostly via its secretory product insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 and prolactin  these regulators induce the expression of growth factors such as amphiregulin epidermal growth factor egf igf1 and fibroblast growth factor fgf which in turn have specific roles in breast growth and maturation  at puberty gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh begins to be secreted in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus   gnrh in turn induces the secretion of the gonadotropins folliclestimulating hormone fsh and luteinizing hormone lh from the pituitary gland   these hormones travel to the ovaries through the bloodstream and cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced by them and released into the body in fluctuating amounts with each menstrual cycle   growth hormone gh which is secreted from the pituitary gland and insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 which is produced in the body in response to gh are growthmediating hormones  during prenatal development infancy and childhood gh and igf1 levels are low but progressively increase and reach a peak at puberty  with a 15 to 3fold increase in pulsatile gh secretion and a 3fold or greater increase in serum igf1 levels being capable of occurring at this time  in late adolescence and early adulthood gh and igf1 levels significantly decrease  and continue to decrease throughout the rest of life  it has been found that both estrogen and gh are essential for breast development at puberty  in the absence of either no development will take place   moreover most of the role of gh in breast development has been found to be mediated by its induction of igf1 production and secretion as igf1 administration rescues breast development in the absence of gh  gh induction of igf1 production and secretion occurs in almost all types of tissue in the body but especially in the liver which is the source of approximately 80 of circulating igf1  as well as locally in the breasts   although igf1 is responsible for most of the role of gh in mediating breast development gh itself has been found to play a direct augmenting role as well as it increases estrogen receptor er expression in breast stromal connective tissue while igf1 in contrast has been found to not do this   in addition to estrogen and ghigf1 both being essential for pubertal breast development they are synergistic in bringing it about    development of the breasts during the prenatal stage of life is independent of biological sex and sex hormones  during embryonic development the breast buds in which networks of tubules are formed are generated from the ectoderm  these rudimentary tubules will eventually become the matured lactiferous milk ducts which connect the lobules milk containers of the breast grapelike clusters of alveoli to the nipples  until puberty the tubule networks of the breast buds remain rudimentary and quiescent  and the male and female breast do not show any differences  during puberty in females estrogen in conjunction with ghigf1 through activation of er\u03b1 specifically and notably not er\u03b2 or gper   causes growth of and transformation of the tubules into the matured ductal system of the breasts    under the influence of estrogen the ducts sprout and elongate and terminal end buds tebs bulbous structures at the tips of the ducts penetrate into the fat pad and branch as the ducts elongate    this continues until a treelike network of branched ducts that is embedded into and fills the entire fat pad of the breast is formed     in addition to its role in mediating ductal development estrogen causes stromal tissue to grow and adipose fat tissue to accumulate   as well as the nippleareolar complex to increase in size  progesterone in conjunction with ghigf1 similarly to estrogen affects the development of the breasts during puberty and thereafter as well    to a lesser extent than estrogen progesterone contributes to ductal development at this time as evidenced by the findings that progesterone receptor pr knockout mice or mice treated with the pr antagonist mifepristone show delayed albeit eventually normal due to estrogen acting on its own ductal growth during puberty and by the fact that progesterone has been found to induce ductal growth on its own in the mouse mammary gland mainly via the induction of the expression of amphiregulin the same growth factor that estrogen primarily induces to mediate its actions on ductal development  in addition progesterone produces modest lobuloalveolar development alveolar bud formation or ductal sidebranching starting at puberty   specifically through activation of prb and notably not pra  with growth and regression of the alveoli occurring to some degree with each menstrual cycle   however only rudimentary alveoli develop in response to prepregnancy levels of progesterone and estrogen and lobuloalveolar development will remain at this stage until pregnancy occurs if it does  in addition to ghigf1 estrogen is required for progesterone to affect the breasts   as estrogen primes the breasts by inducing the expression of the progesterone receptor pr in breast epithelial tissue  in contrast to the case of the pr er expression in the breast is stable and differs relatively little in the contexts of reproductive status stage of the menstrual cycle or exogenous hormonal therapy  during pregnancy pronounced breast growth and maturation occurs in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding    estrogen and progesterone levels increase dramatically  reaching levels by late pregnancy that are several hundredfold higher than usual menstrual cycle levels  estrogen and progesterone cause the secretion of high levels of prolactin from the anterior pituitary   which reach levels as high as 20 times greater than normal menstrual cycle levels  igf1 and igf2 levels also increase dramatically during pregnancy due to secretion of placental growth hormone pgh  further ductal development by estrogen again in conjunction with ghigf1 occurs during pregnancy   in addition the concert of estrogen progesterone again specifically through prb  prolactin and other lactogens such as human placental lactogen hpl and pgh in conjunction with ghigf1 as well as insulinlike growth factor 2 igf2   acting together mediate the completion of lobuloalveolar development of the breasts during pregnancy     both pr and prolactin receptor prlr knockout mice fail to show lobuloalveolar development and progesterone and prolactin have been found to be synergistic in mediating growth of alveoli demonstrating the essential role of both of these hormones in this aspect of breast development   growth hormone receptor ghr knockout mice also show greatly impaired lobuloalveolar development  in addition to their role in lobuloalveolar growth prolactin and hpl act to increase the size of the nippleareolar complex during pregnancy  by the end of the fourth month of pregnancy at which time lobuloalveolar maturation is complete the breasts are fully prepared for lactation and breastfeeding  insulin glucocorticoids such as cortisol and by extension adrenocorticotropic hormone acth and thyroid hormones such as thyroxine and by extension thyroidstimulating hormone tsh and thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh also play permissive but less wellunderstoodpoorlycharacterized roles in breast development during both puberty and pregnancy and are required for full functional development     leptin has also been found to be an important factor in mammary gland development and has been found to promote mammary epithelial cell proliferation   in contrast to the femaleassociated sex hormones estrogen and progesterone the maleassociated sex hormones the androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone dht powerfully suppress the action of estrogen in the breasts     at least one way that they do this is by reducing the expression of the estrogen receptor in breast tissue    in the absence of androgenic activity such as in women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais modest levels of estrogen 50 pgml are capable of mediating significant breast development with cais women showing breast volumes that are even aboveaverage  the combination of much higher levels of androgens about 10fold higher and much lower levels of estrogen about 10fold less  due to the ovaries in females producing high amounts of estrogens but low amounts of androgens and the testes in males producing high amounts of androgens but low amounts of estrogens  are why males generally do not grow prominent or welldeveloped breasts relative to females   calcitriol the hormonally active form of vitamin d acting through the vitamin d receptor vdr has like the androgens been reported to be a negative regulator of breast development in mice for instance during puberty  vdr knockout mice show more extensive ductal development relative to wildtype mice  as well as precocious mammary gland development  in addition vdr knockout has also been shown to result in increased responsiveness of mouse mammary gland tissue to estrogen and progesterone which was represented by increased cell growth in response to these hormones  conversely however it has been found that vdr knockout mice show reduced ductal differentiation represented by an increased number of undifferentiated tebs  and this finding has been interpreted as indicating that vitamin d may be essential for lobuloalveolar development  as such calcitriol via the vdr may be a negative regulator of ductal development but a positive regulator of lobuloalveolar development in the mammary gland  a possible mechanism of the negative regulatory effects of the vdr on breast development may be indicated by a study of vitamin d3 supplementation in women which found that vitamin d3 suppresses cyclooxygenase2 cox2 expression in the breast and by doing so reduces and increases respectively the levels of prostaglandin e2 pge2 and transforming growth factor \u03b22 tgf\u03b22 a known inhibitory factor in breast development  moreover suppression of pge2 in breast tissue is relevant because via activation of prostaglandin ep receptors pge2 potently induces amphiregulin expression in breast tissue and activation of the egfr by amphiregulin increases cox2 expression in breast tissue in turn resulting in more pge2 and thus a selfperpetuating synergistic cycle of growth amplification due to cox2 appears to potentially be present in normal breast tissue   accordingly overexpression of cox2 in mammary gland tissue produces mammary gland hyperplasia as well as precocious mammary gland development in female mice mirroring the phenotype of vdr knockout mice and demonstrating a strong stimulatory effect of cox2 which is downregulated by vdr activation on the growth of the mammary glands   also in accordance cox2 activity in the breasts has been found to be positively associated with breast volume in women  estrogen progesterone and prolactin as well as ghigf1 produce their effects on breast development by modulating the local expression in breast tissue of an assortment of autocrine and paracrine growth factors      including igf1 igf2 amphiregulin  egf fgf hepatocyte growth factor hgf  tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 tnf\u03b1 tumor necrosis factor \u03b2 tnf\u03b2 transforming growth factor \u03b1 tgf\u03b1  transforming growth factor \u03b2 tgf\u03b2  heregulin  wnt  rankl  and leukemia inhibitory factor lif  these factors regulate cellular growth proliferation and differentiation via activation of intracellular signaling cascades that control cell function such as erk akt jnk and jakstat     based on research with epidermal growth factor receptor egfr knockout mice the egfr which is the molecular target of egf tgf\u03b1 amphiregulin and heregulin has similarly to the insulinlike growth factor1 receptor igf1r  been found to be essential for mammary gland development  estrogen and progesterone mediate ductal development mainly through induction of amphiregulin expression and thus downstream egfr activation      accordingly er\u03b1 amphiregulin and egfr knockout mice copy each other phenotypically in regards to their effects on ductal development  also in accordance treatment of mice with amphiregulin or other egfr ligands like tgf\u03b1 or heregulin induces ductal and lobuloalveolar development in the mouse mammary gland actions that occur even in the absence of estrogen and progesterone   as both the igf1r and the egfr are independently essential for mammary gland development and as combined application of igf1 and egf through their respective receptors has been found to synergistically stimulate the growth of human breast epithelial cells these growth factor systems appear to work together in mediating breast development    upon parturition childbirth estrogen and progesterone rapidly drop to very low levels with progesterone levels being undetectable while prolactin levels remain elevated   as estrogen and progesterone block prolactininduced lactogenesis by suppressing prolactin receptor prlr expression in breast tissue specifically their sudden absence results in the commencement of milk production and lactation by prolactin   expression of the prlr in breast tissue may increase by as much as 20fold when estrogen and progesterone levels drop upon childbirth  with suckling from the infant prolactin and oxytocin are secreted and mediate milk production and letdown respectively    prolactin suppresses the secretion of lh and fsh which in turn results in continued low levels of estrogen and progesterone and temporary amenorrhea absence of menstrual cycles occurs  in the absence of regular episodic suckling which keeps prolactin concentrations high levels of prolactin will quickly drop the menstrual cycle will resume and hence normal estrogen and progesterone levels will return and lactation will cease that is until next parturition or until induced lactation ie with a galactogogue occurs  some factors of breast morphology including their density are clearly implicated in breast cancer while breast size is moderately heritable the relationship between breast size and cancer is uncertain the genetic variants influencing breast size have not been identified  through genomewide association studies a variety of genetic polymorphisms have been linked to breast size  some of these include rs7816345 near znf703 zinc finger protein 703 rs4849887 and rs17625845 flanking inhbb inhibin \u03b2b rs12173570 near esr1 er\u03b1 rs7089814 in znf365 zinc finger protein 365 rs12371778 near pthlh parathyroid hormonelike hormone rs62314947 near areg amphiregulin  as well as rs10086016 at 8p1123 which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs7816345 and rs5995871 at 22q13 contains the mkl1 gene which has been found to modulate the transcriptional activity of er\u03b1  many of these polymorphisms are also associated with the risk of developing breast cancer revealing a potential positive association between breast size and breast cancer risk   however conversely some polymorphisms show a negative association between breast size and breast cancer risk  in any case a metaanalysis concluded that breast size and risk of breast cancer are indeed importantly related  circulating igf1 levels are positively associated with breast volume in women  in addition the absence of the common 19repeat allele in the igf1 gene is also positively associated with breast volume in women as well as with high igf1 levels during oral contraceptive use and with lessening of the normal ageassociated decline in circulating igf1 concentrations in women  there is great variation in the prevalence of the igf1 19repeat allele between ethnic groups and its absence has been reported to be highest among africanamerican women  genetic variations in the ar have been linked to both breast volume as well as body mass index and breast cancer aggressiveness  cox2 expression has been positively associated with breast volume and inflammation in breast tissue as well as with breast cancer risk and prognosis  women with cais who are completely insensitive to the armediated actions of androgens have as a group aboveaverage sized breasts this is true despite the fact that they simultaneously have relatively low levels of estrogen which demonstrates the powerful suppressant effect of androgens on estrogenmediated breast development  elevated levels of hgf and to a lesser extent igf1 by 54fold and 18fold respectively in breast stromal tissue have been found in macromastia a very rare condition of extremely and excessively large breast size  exposure of macromastic breast stromal tissue to nonmacromastic breast epithelial tissue was found to cause increased alveolar morphogenesis and epithelial proliferation in the latter  a neutralizing antibody for hgf but not for igf1 or egf was found to attenuate the proliferative activity of macromastic breast stromal cells potentially directly implicating hgf in the breast growth and enlargement seen in macromastia  also a genomewide association study has highly implicated hgf and its receptor cmet in breast cancer aggressiveness  aromatase excess syndrome an extremely rare condition characterized by marked hyperestrogenism is associated with precocious breast development and macromastia in females and similarly precocious gynecomastia womens breasts in males    in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome a condition in which the ar is defective and insensitive to androgens there is full breast development with breast volumes that are in fact above average in spite of relatively low levels of estrogen 50 pgml estradiol  in aromatase deficiency a form of hypoestrogenism in which aromatase is defective and cannot synthesize estrogen and in complete estrogen insensitivity syndrome a condition in which er\u03b1 is defective and insensitive to estrogen breast development is completely absent

V the parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck of humans and other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone humans usually have four parathyroid glands variably located on the back of the thyroid gland although considerable variation exists  parathyroid hormone and calcitonin one of the hormones made by the thyroid gland have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones the parathyroid glands share a similar blood supply venous drainage and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands the parathyroid glands are derived from the epithelial lining of the third and fourth branchial pouches with the superior glands arising from the fourth pouch and the inferior glands arising from the higher third pouch the relative position of the inferior and superior glands which are named according to their final location changes because of the migration of embryological tissues hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism characterised by alterations in the blood calcium levels and bone metabolism are states of surplus or insufficient parathyroid function   the parathyroid glands are two pairs of glands usually positioned behind the left and right lobes of the thyroid each gland is a yellowishbrown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly  there are typically four parathyroid glands the two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women  these glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck  the blood supply drainage and lymphatic drainage of the parathyroid glands correspond to the thyroid overlying gland  the superior parathyroid glands receive their blood from the inferior thyroid arteries the inferior parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply from either the ascending branch of the inferior thyroid arteries or the thyroid ima artery the inferior thyroid artery arises from the subclavian arteries  each parathyroid vein drains into the superior middle and inferior thyroid veins the superior and middle thyroid veins drain into the internal jugular vein and the inferior thyroid vein drains into the brachiocephalic vein  lymphatic vessels from the parathyroid glands drain into deep cervical lymph nodes and paratracheal lymph nodes  the parathyroid glands are variable in number three or more small glands  and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland  occasionally some individuals may have six eight or even more parathyroid glands  rarely the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself the chest or even the thymus  the parathyroid glands are named for their proximity to the thyroid but serve a completely different role than the thyroid gland the parathyroid glands are quite easily recognizable from the thyroid as they have densely packed cells in contrast with the follicular structure of the thyroid  two unique types of cells are present in the parathyroid gland intermediate magnification micrograph he stain the white round structures are fat cells adipose tissue comprises 2540 of normal parathyroid gland tissue  high magnification micrograph he stain the small dark cells are chief cells which are responsible for secreting parathyroid hormone high magnification micrograph he stain the cells with orangepink staining cytoplasm are oxyphil cells in early human embryonic life a series of six branchial pouches form that given rise to the human face neck and surrounding structures the pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest to the top of the embryos head and the sixth is the furthest from it the parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme  the position of the glands reverses during embryological life the pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch during embryological development the third pouch migrates downwards dragging the inferior glands with it the superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree the glands are named after their final not embryological positions  parathyroid development is regulated by a number of genes including those coding for several transcription factors   the major function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the bodys calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly the parathyroid glands do this by secreting parathyroid hormone  parathyroid hormone pth also known as parathormone is a small protein that takes part in the control of calcium and phosphate homeostasis as well as bone physiology parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin  parathyroid disease is conventionally divided into states where the parathyroid is overactive hyperparathyroidism and states where the parathyroid is under or hypoactive hypoparathyroidism both states are characterised by their symptoms which relate to the excess or deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood  hyperparathyroidism is the state in which there is excess parathyroid hormone circulating this may cause bone pain and tenderness due to increased bone resorption due to increased circulating calcium there may be other symptoms associated with hypercalcemia most commonly dehydration hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a benign proliferation of chief cells in single gland and rarely men syndrome this is known as primary hyperparathyroidism  which is generally managed by surgical removal of the abnormal parathyroid gland  renal disease may also lead to hyperparathyroidism when too much calcium is lost there is a compensation by the parathyroid and parathyroid hormone is released the glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone this is also known as secondary hyperparathyroidism if this situation exists for a prolonged period of time the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone this is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism  the state of decreased parathyroid activity is known as hypoparathyroidism this is most commonly associated with damage to the glands or their blood supply during thyroid surgery although it may also be associated with rarer genetic syndromes such as digeorge syndrome which is inherited as an autosomal dominant syndrome hypoparathyroidism will also occur after surgical removal of the parathyroid glands  occasionally an individuals tissues are resistant to the effects of parathyroid hormone this is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism as although the parathyroid glands are fully functional the hormone itself is not able to function resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition albrights hereditary osteodystrophy pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism one of the longest words in the english language is used to describe an individual with albrights hereditary osteodystrophy but with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels  hypoparathyroidism may present with symptoms associated with decreased calcium and is generally treated with vitamin d analogues  the parathyroid glands were first discovered in the indian rhinoceros by richard owen in 1852  in his description of the neck anatomy owen referred to the glands as a small compact yellow glandular body attached to the thyroid at the point where the veins emerged the glands were first discovered in humans by ivar viktor sandström 18521889 a swedish medical student in 1880 at uppsala university  unaware of owens description he described the glands in his monograph on a new gland in man and fellow animals as the glandulae parathyroidae noting its existence in dogs cats rabbits oxen horses and humans   for several years sandströms description received little attention  physiologist eugene gley first documented the putative function of the glands in 1891 noting the connection between their removal and the development of muscular tetani william g maccallum in 1908 investigating tumours of the parathyroid proposed their role in calcium metabolism  he noted that tetany occurs spontaneously in many forms and may also be produced by the destruction of the parathyroid glands  the first successful removal of the parathyroid may have been carried out in 1928 by medical doctor isaac y olch whose intern had noticed elevated calcium levels in an elderly patient with muscle weakness prior to this surgery patients with removed parathyroid glands typically died from muscular tetani  parathyroid hormone was isolated in 1923 by adolph m hanson and 1925 by james b collip studies of parathyroid hormone levels by roger guillemin andrew schally and rosalyn sussman yalow led to the development of immunoassays capable of measuring body substances and a nobel prize in 1977   parathyroid glands are found in all adult tetrapods although they vary in their number and position mammals typically have four parathyroid glands while other types of animals typically have six the removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle contractions  fish do not possess parathyroid glands however several species have been found to express parathyroid hormone developmental genes and calciumsensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds and mammals it has been suggested that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish

V the mesonephros greek middle kidney is one of three excretory organs that develop in vertebrates it serves as the main excretory organ of aquatic vertebrates and as a temporary kidney in reptiles birds and mammals the mesonephros is included in the wolffian body after caspar friedrich wolff who described it in 1759 the wolffian body is composed of mesonephros  paramesonephrotic blastema   the mesonephros acts as a structure similar to the kidney that in humans functions between the sixth and tenth weeks of embryological life despite the similarity in structure function and terminology however the mesonephric nephrons do not form any part of the mature kidney or nephrons  in humans the mesonephros consists of units which are similar in structure and function to nephrons of the adult kidney each of these consists of a glomerulus a tuft of capillaries which arises from lateral branches of dorsal aorta and drains into the inferior cardinal vein a bowmans capsule a funnel like structure which surrounds the glomerulus and a mesonephric tubule a tube which connects the bowmans capsule to the mesonephric duct  a unit consisting of a single glomerulus and the bowmans capsule surrounding it is called renal corpuscle and a unit consisting of single renal corpuscle with its associated mesonephric tubule is called a nephron  or excretory mesonephric unit  formation of each mesonephric nephron begins when a bit of the intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the mesonephric duct differentiates to form a mesonephric vesicle  this vesicle then elongates to form the mesonephric tubule attaching to the mesonephric duct on one side meanwhile an artery from the dorsal aorta begins extending towards the mesonephric tubule when these two structures contact each other they form the glomerulus and the bowmans capsule surrounding it  the mesonephric tubule is also known as the wolffian tubules or kobelts tubules on the medial side of the mesonephric duct from the sixth cervical to the third lumbar segments a series of tubules the wolffian tubules develops they increase in number by outgrowths from the original tubules the change from solid masses of cells to instead become hollowed in the center one end grows toward and finally opens into the mesonephric duct the other dilates and is invaginated by a tuft of capillary bloodvessels to form a glomerulus  the tubules collectively constitute the mesonephros  the mesonephros as a whole produces urine from the 6th through the 10th week of development  despite the similarity in structure function and terminology however the mesonephric nephrons do not form any part of the mature kidney or nephrons  as the more caudal nephrons form the more cranial nephrons are already degenerating in females the mesonephros degenerates entirely though vestigial structures such as gartners ducts the epoophoron and paroophoron are common in males a few of the more caudal tubules will survive and give rise to the efferent ductules of the testis  the epididymis vas deferens seminal vesicle as well as vestigial structures such as the appendix testis appendix epididymis and paradidymis the mesonephros persists and forms the anterior portion of the permanent kidneys in fish and amphibians but in reptiles birds and mammals it atrophies and for the most part disappears rapidly as the permanent kidney metanephros begins to develop  during the sixth or seventh week by the beginning of the fifth month of human development only the ducts and a few of the tubules of the mesonephros remain broad ligament of adult showing epoöphoron

V the practice of selling ones kidney for profit in iran is legal and regulated by the government in any given year it is estimated that 1400 iranians sell one of their kidneys to a recipient who was previously unknown to them  iran currently is the only country in the world that allows the sale of ones kidney for compensation typically a payment consequently the country does not have either a waiting list or a shortage of available organs   according to an article in clinical journal of the american society of nephrology the model has avoided many problems associated with organ trade but all models used in other developing countries have failed to slow down the worsening of transplant queues    the first kidney transplantation in the middle eastern region was conducted in 1967 in iran it was not until the mid1980s that these operations became commonplace iran allows kidney donations from both cadavers and compensated donors before the april 2000 law passed by parliament justifying the procurement of organs from those deemed clinically braindead donorcompensated transplants represented over 99 percent of cases it is now estimated that 13 percent of donations come from cadavers  market proponents such as the cato institute claim that after financial incentives were introduced into the kidney market iran eliminated their transplant waiting list by 1999  however a closer examination reveals that many iranians afflicted with endstage renal disease dont receive a diagnosis and arent referred for dialysis so therefore would never be eligible for a transplant  ahad ghods from the hashemi nejad kidney hospital in iran admitted this is the main reason that the renal transplant waiting list was eliminated quickly and successfully in iran   the model is organised through voluntary worker organizations the receivers and the government pay for the donors charity organizations help those who cannot pay themselves  the charity association for the support of kidney patients caskp and the charity foundation for special diseases cfsd under control of the ministry of health regulates the trade of organs with the support of the government the organizations match donors to recipients arranging for tests to ensure compatibility in order to prevent corruption or inequality neither the transplant center nor transplant physicians are involved in identifying potential vendors  the amounts paid to the donor vary in iran however the average figures are between 2000 to 4000 for a kidney donation  in contrast a compatible kidney sold on the global blackmarket can cost in excess of 160000 in some cases  in 1996 islamic religious scholars from the muslim law council of great britain issued a fatwa allowing the practice of organ transplants   however as this decree allows donation to help save the life of another it disallows acts of commerce trade or compensation in donations  in saudi arabia transplants are performed using medicinal cadavers rather than living donors the practice is sponsored and regulated by the government through the saudi center for organ transplantation scot the organization is also responsible for the standards of care public and formal education regulations and monitoring of all types of organ transplants because of the limited number of cadaver candidates there are not enough donations to satisfy demand

V cat intelligence is the capacity of the domesticated cat to learn solve problems and adapt to its environment researchers have also shown feline intelligence to include the ability to acquire new behavior that applies previously learned knowledge to new situations communicating needs and desires within a social group and responding to training cues    the brain of the domesticated cat is about 5 centimetres 20 inches long and weighs 2530g 088106oz   if a typical cat is taken to be 60cm 24in long with a weight of 33kg 73lb then the brain would be at 091  of its total body mass compared to 233  of total body mass in the average human within the encephalization quotient proposed by jerison in 1973   values above 1 are classified big brained lower than 1 are small brained  the domestic cat is attributed a value of between 1171 relative to human value that is 74478   the largest brain in the cat kingdom are those of the tigers in java and bali of which the largest relative brain size within the pantera is the tigris  it is debated whether there exists a causal relationship between brain size and intelligence in vertebrates correlations have been shown between these factors in a number  of experiments  however correlation does not imply causation most experiments involving the relevance of brain size to intelligence hinge on the assumption that complex behavior requires a complex and therefore intelligent brain however this connection has not been consistently demonstrated      the surface area of a cats cerebral cortex is approximately 83cm  13in  whereas the human brain has a surface area of about 2500cm  390in   furthermore a theoretical cat weighing 25kg 55lb has a cerebellum weighing 53g 019oz 017 of the total weight  according to researchers at tufts university school of veterinary medicine the physical structure of the brains of humans and cats are very similar  the human brain and the cat brain both have cerebral cortices  with similar lobes  the number of cortical neurons contained in the brain of the cat is reported to be 763 million  area 17  of the visual cortex was found to contain about 51400 neurons per mm    both human and feline brains are gyrencephalic ie they have a surface folding   analyses of cat brains have shown they are divided into many areas with specialized tasks that are extremely interconnected and share sensory information in a kind of hubandspoke network with a large number of specialized hubs and many alternate paths between them this exchange of sensory information allows the brain to construct a complex perception of the real world and to react to and manipulate its environment  the thalamus of the cat   constituting a hypothalamus  epithalamus ventral and dorsal parts  and including a lateral geniculate nucleus  and additional secondary nuclear structures are responsible for controlling impulses to the cortex functions of sleep memory originally formed of sensory datum and cellular functioning otherwise unknown as yet not fully understood unaccounted for   the thalamus has neuronal connectivity to the cerebellum  grouse et al 1979 ascertained the neuroplasticity of kittens brains with respect to control of visual stimulus correlated with changes in rna structures  in a later study it was found that cats possess visualrecognition memory   and have flexibility of cerebral encoding from visual information adaptability corresponding to changing environmental stimuli  the domestic cat brain also contains the hippocampus  amygdala  frontal lobes which comprise 3 to 35 of the total brain in cats compared to about 25 in humans   corpus callosum   anterior commissure  pineal gland  caudate nucleus septal nuclei and midbrain  for the optimum health and functioning of the brain a cat would require primarily manganese potassium vitamin d vitamin b1 and vitamin b6 calcium sodium magnesium and vitamin a should be provided as part of a nutritionally balanced diet  additionally taurine is an essential amino acid in a cats diet taurine insufficiency leads to retinal degeneration and cardiac failure  intelligence through behavioural observation is defined as a composite of skills and abilities  the wais test is a measure of intelligence in adult homo sapiens the test scores on four criteria verbal comprehension perceptual organisation working memory and processing speed  in a comparative evaluation from wais criteria cats are generally fair in intelligence  the working memory for object permanence of the domesticated cat is surmised from experiment as being 16 hours  factors that contribute to greater intelligence are the velocity at which electrical transmission is conducted and with the greater number of cortical neurons  compared to mammalian species this number was elevenfourteenth in total   experimental results seemed to indicate that cats have no capacity for object permanence  as defined through investigation by j piaget with infants  further research made to identify a similar factor of cognition showed behaviour indicative of object permanence cognition although of a different type to that identified initially by piaget   further research showed that the animal has an awareness of objects not directly available to sight and also sensorymotor intelligence comparable with a twoyearold child  in experimental conditions the memory of a cat was demonstrated as having an informationretention or recall of a duration totalling as much as 10 years  some studies have suggested that cats may dream    taken as a whole cats have excellent memories  however relationships with humans individual differences in intelligence and age may affect memory cats adapt to the environment that they are in easily because they can recall what they have learned in the past and adapt these memories to the current situation to protect themselves throughout their lives   for kittens play is more than simple enjoyment and fun in the animal world these things rank social order and preycapturing skills and hone the cat for survival in addition to this they are exercising their minds and bodies in rehearsal for their adult roles before they were domesticated kittens learned survival skills such as where to find food from observing their mothers the first two to seven weeks are a critical time for kittens this is when they bond with other cats without any human contact during this time the cat would forever mistrust humans according to some experts   just as in humans advancing age may affect memory in cats some cats may experience a weakening of both learning ability and memory that affects them adversely in ways similar to those occurring in poorly aging humans a slowing of function is normal and this includes memory aging may affect memory by changing the way their brain stores information and by making it harder to recall stored information cats lose brain cells as they age just as humans do  the older the cat the more these changes can affect its memory there have been no studies done on the memories of aging cats and memory but there is some speculation that just like people short term memory is more affected by aging  in one test of where to find food cats shortterm memory lasted about 16 hours  disease may also affect cat memory there is a syndrome called feline cognitive dysfunction fcd that is similar to alzheimers disease in humans the symptoms include disorientation reduced social interaction sleep disturbances and loss of house training this syndrome causes degenerative changes in the brain that are the source of the functional impairment  cat intelligence study is mostly from consideration of the domesticated cat the process of domestication has allowed for closer observation of cat behaviour and in the increased incidence of interspecies communication   the inherent plasticity of the cats brain has become apparent as the number of studies in this have increased scientific insight changes in the genetic structure of a number of cats has been identified   as a consequence of both domestication practises and the activity of breeding so that the species has undergone genetic evolutionary change due to human selection   the domesticated cat developed by artificial selection to possess characteristics desirable for the sharing of human habitation and living coupled with an initial naturally occurring selective set of catchoices made while interacting with neolithic urban environments  the intelligence of the cat is believed to be largely dependent upon its interspecies relations  eg between h sapiens and f catus and is reflected in responses in the stress hormones released in cats kept from exploratative behaviours that is to say an enriched and stimulating environment produced by exploring urban places increased the likelihood of cerebral plasticity due to the need of situations requiring novel adaptive behaviours  this scavenging behaviour   would only have produced slow changes in evolutionary terms such changes are comparable to the changes to the brain  of early primitive hominids who coexisted with primitive cats like machairodontinae megantereon and homotherium and adapted to savannah conditions     xenarthra late cretaceousarmadillos anteaters sloths pholidota late cretaceouspangolins some extinct

the fossilbased family tree of placental mammals  above the feline line diverged many years previously from the primate line the cat both feral and domesticated is likely to be maintained in a stasis by its niche position in the current food web  the cats in the key experiments conducted by edward thorndike were able to learn through operant conditioning  in thorndikes experiment cats were placed in various boxes approximately 20inches long 15inches wide and 12inches tall with a door opened by pulling a weight attached to it the cats were observed to free themselves from the boxes by trial and error with accidental success   in one test the cat was shown to have done worse in a later trial than in an earlier one suggesting that no learning from the previous trials was retained in longterm memory  the scientist considered the cat to have the capacity for learning due to the law of effect which states that responses followed by satisfaction ie a reward become more likely responses to the same stimulus in the future  an experiment was conducted in 2009 where cats could pull on a string to retrieve a treat under a plastic screen when presented with one string cats had no trouble getting the treats when presented with multiple strings some of which were not connected to treats the cats were unable to consistently choose the correct strings leading to the conclusion that cats do not understand cause and effect in the same way that humans do   thorndike was skeptical of the presence of intelligence in cats criticising sources of the contemporary writing of the sentience of animals as partiality in deductions from facts and more especially in the choice of facts for investigation  research was made to identify possible observational learning in kittens kittens that were able to observe their mothers performing an experimentally organised act were able to perform the same act sooner than kittens that had observed a nonrelated adult cat and sooner than the ones who being placed in trial and error conditions observed no other cat performing the act    experimental investigation of primates show that the chimpanzee possess some limited insight in regard to observational learning see köhler whereas this capacity is wholly absent in the domesticated cat    p leo and p tigris cats are known to be trained as circus animals  although traditionally considered difficult mainly because they appear to assume such behaviors only in exchange for a direct benefit  a good example of this is the yuri kuklachev cat theatre based in moscow  the owner of which has been training cats for many years to do a full range of circusstyle tricks also there is the belief that cats are difficult to train owing to impatience and boredom with the training exercise  since 2006 when the entire dna constituents in sequence of the abyssinian cat were made into a genetic map of the felis catus   genetically engineering some form of enhanced cat intelligence has become theoretically possible artificially enhanced cat intelligence would therefore only become a consideration for use in experiment perhaps at some unknown time in future the production of more intelligent cats might be theoretically a consideration for military organisations ie darpa in the hope of gleaning some advancement in warfare practically the common cat has proved little use for military personnel acoustic kitty despite the potential inherent in a creature with far greater prowess and agility than any human  in november 2009 scientists claimed to simulate a cats brain using a supercomputer  containing 24576 processors   this experiment did not simulate the function of the individual neurons in the brain nor their synaptic patterns it was intended to demonstrate that the problem of simulating a biological brain could be scaled to very large supercomputer platforms  however the approach has been criticised as flawed   there are a number of reasons the cat brain is a goal of computer simulations cats are familiar and easily kept animals so the physiology of cats has been particularly well studied the physical structures of human brains and cat brains are very similar  cats like humans have binocular vision that gives them depth perception  building artificial mammal brains requires ever more powerful computers as the brain gets more complex from the mouse brain to the rat brain in 2007 to the cat brain and ultimately to the human brain building artificial mammal brains advances the research of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence but also leads to questions of the definition of sentient and conscious life forms and to the ethics of artificial consciousness and the ethics of artificial intelligence

V the heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system  blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients and also assists in the removal of metabolic wastes  the heart is located in the middle compartment of the mediastinum in the chest  in humans other mammals and birds the heart is divided into four chambers upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles   commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart  fish in contrast have two chambers an atrium and a ventricle while reptiles have three chambers  in a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves which prevent backflow  the heart is enclosed in a protective sac the pericardium which also contains a small amount of fluid the wall of the heart is made up of three layers epicardium myocardium and endocardium  the heart pumps blood through both circulatory systems blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior vena cavae and passes to the right ventricle from here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulationwhere the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide  in addition the blood carries nutrients from the liver and gastrointestinal tract to various organs of the body while transporting waste to the liver and kidneys  normally with each heartbeat the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs as the left ventricle pumps to the body veins transport blood to the heart and carry deoxygenated blood  except for the pulmonary and portal veins arteries transport blood away from the heart and apart from the pulmonary artery hold oxygenated blood their increased distance from the heart cause veins to have lower pressures than arteries   the heart contracts at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute  exercise temporarily increases the rate but lowers resting heart rate in the long term and is good for heart health  cardiovascular diseases cvd are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 accounting for 30 of deaths   of these more than three quarters follow coronary artery disease and stroke  risk factors include smoking being overweight little exercise high cholesterol high blood pressure and poorly controlled diabetes among others  diagnosis of cvd is often done by listening to the heartsounds with a stethoscope ecg or by ultrasound  specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment  the heart is situated in the middle mediastinum behind the breastbone in the chest at the level of thoracic vertebrae t5t8 the largest part of the heart is usually slightly offset to the left side of the chest though occasionally it may be offset to the right and is felt to be on the left because the left heart is stronger since it pumps to all body parts because the heart is between the lungs the left lung is smaller than the right lung and has a cardiac notch in its border to accommodate the heart the heart is supplied by the coronary circulation and is enclosed in a doublemembraned sacthe pericardium this attaches to the mediastinum providing anchorage for the heart  the back surface of the heart lies near to the vertebral column and the front surface sits deep to the sternum and costal cartilages  two of the great veins  the venae cavae and the great arteries the aorta and pulmonary artery are attached to the upper part of the heart called the base which is located at the level of the third costal cartilage  the lower tip of the heart the apex lies just to the left of the sternum 8 to 9cm from the midsternal line between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages  the right side of the heart is deflected forwards and the left deflected to the back  the heart is coneshaped with its base positioned upwards and tapering down to the apex  a stethoscope can be placed directly over the apex so that the heartbeats can be counted an adult heart has a mass of 250350 grams 912oz  the heart is typically the size of a fist 12cm 5in in length 8cm 35in wide and 6cm 25in in thickness  welltrained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the heart muscle similar to the response of skeletal muscle  the heart wall is made up of three layers the inner endocardium middle myocardium and outer epicardium these are surrounded by a doublemembraned sac called the pericardium the innermost layer of the heart is called the endocardium it is made up of a lining of simple squamous epithelium and covers heart chambers and valves it is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue  the endocardium by secreting endothelins may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium  the middle layer of the heart wall is the myocardium which is the cardiac muscle a layer of involuntary striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen the myocardium is also supplied with blood vessels and nerve fibers by way of the epicardium that help to regulate the heart rate  cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate  spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart this autorhythmicity is still modulated by the endocrine and nervous systems  there are two types of cardiac muscle cell cardiomyocytes which have the ability to contract easily and modified cardiomyocytes the pacemaker cells of the conducting system the cardiomyocytes make up the bulk 99 of cells in the atria and ventricles these contractile cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells the intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries  the pacemaker cells make up 1 of cells and form the conduction system of the heart they are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility their function is similar in many respects to neurons  the cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart  they form a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels  deeper ventricular muscles also form a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex more superficial layers of ventricular muscle wrap around both ventricles  this complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively than a simple linear pattern would  as with skeletal muscles the heart can increase in size and efficiency with exercise  thus endurance athletes such as marathon runners may have a heart that has increased in size by up to 40  the pericardium surrounds the heart it consists of two membranes an inner serous membrane called the epicardium and an outer fibrous membrane  these enclose the pericardial cavity which contains the pericardial fluid that lubricates the surface of the heart the heart has four chambers two upper atria the receiving chambers and two lower ventricles the discharging chambers the atria are connected to the ventricles by the atrioventricular valves and separated from the ventricles by the coronary sulcus there is an earshaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage or auricle and another in the upper left atrium the left atrial appendage the right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart and this sometimes includes the pulmonary artery similarly the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart the ventricles are separated by the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus the cardiac skeleton is made of dense connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart it forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves  the cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the hearts electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity the interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles  the interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract  all four heart valves lie along the same plane the valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart and prevent backflow between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve this consists of three cusps flaps or leaflets made of endocardium reinforced with additional connective tissue each of the three valvecusps is attached to several strands of connective tissue the chordae tendineae tendinous cords sometimes referred to as the heart strings they are composed of approximately 80 percent collagenous fibers with the remainder consisting of elastic fibers and endothelium they connect each of the cusps to a papillary muscle that extends from the lower ventricular surface these muscles control the opening and closing of the valves the three papillary muscles in the right ventricle are called the anterior posterior and septal muscles which correspond to the three positions of the valve cusps between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve also known as the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps an anterior and a posterior medial cusp these cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall the tricuspid and the mitral valves are the atrioventricular valves during the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight however as the ventricle contracts so do the papillary muscles this creates tension on the chordae tendineae helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria  the semilunar pulmonary valve is located at the base of the pulmonary artery this has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles when the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocketlike valve pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve the semilunar aortic valve is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to papillary muscles this too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta  the two major systemic veins the superior and inferior venae cavae and the collection of veins that make up the coronary sinus which drains the myocardium empty into the right atrium the superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium the inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava immediately above and to the middle of the opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thinwalled coronary sinus  in the wall of the right atrium is an ovalshaped depression known as the fossa ovalis which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale the foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium allowing some blood to bypass the pulmonary circuit within seconds after birth a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern  most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles which are also present in the right atrial appendage  the atria receive venous blood on a nearly continuous basis preventing venous flow from stopping while the ventricles are contracting while most ventricular filling occurs while the atria are relaxed they do demonstrate a contractile phase when they actively pump blood into the ventricles just prior to ventricular contraction the right atrium is connected to the right ventricle by the tricuspid valve  when the myocardium of the ventricle contracts pressure within the ventricular chamber rises blood like any fluid flows from higher pressure to lower pressure areas in this case toward the pulmonary artery and the atrium to prevent any potential backflow the papillary muscles also contract generating tension on the chordae tendineae this prevents the flaps of the valves from being forced into the atria and regurgitation of the blood back into the atria during ventricular contraction  the walls of the right ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium in addition to these muscular ridges a band of cardiac muscle also covered by endocardium known as the moderator band reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction it arises from the lower part of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle  when the right ventricle contracts it ejects blood into the pulmonary artery which branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry it to each lung the upper surface of the right ventricle begins to taper as it approaches the pulmonary artery at the base of the pulmonary artery is the pulmonary semilunar valve that prevents backflow from the pulmonary artery  after gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries blood high in oxygen returns to the left atrium via one of the four pulmonary veins only the left atrial appendage contains pectinate muscles blood flows nearly continuously from the pulmonary veins back into the atrium which acts as the receiving chamber and from here through an opening into the left ventricle most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period the left atrium will contract pumping blood into the ventricle this atrial contraction accounts for approximately 20 percent of ventricular filling the left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve  although both sides of the heart will pump the same amount of blood the muscular layer is much thicker in the left ventricle compared to the right due to the greater force needed here like the right ventricle the left also has trabeculae carneae but there is no moderator band the left ventricle is the major pumping chamber for the systemic circuit it ejects blood into the aorta through the aortic semilunar valve  cardiomyocytes like all other cells need to be supplied with oxygen nutrients and a way of removing metabolic wastes this is achieved by the coronary circulation the coronary circulation cycles in peaks and troughs correlating to the heart muscles relaxation or contraction  coronary arteries supply oxygenrich blood to the heart and the coronary veins remove the deoxygenated blood there is a left and a right coronary artery supplying the left and right hearts respectively and the septa smaller branches of these arteries anastomose which in other parts of the body serve to divert blood due to a blockage in the heart these are very small and cannot form other interconnections with the result that a coronary artery blockage can cause a myocardial infarction and with it tissue damage  the great cardiac vein receives the major branches of the posterior middle and small cardiac veins and drains into the coronary sinus a large vein that empties into the right atrium the anterior cardiac veins drain the front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium   the heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into embryogenesis this early start is crucial for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development the heart derives from splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the cardiogenic region two endocardial tubes form here that fuse to form a primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart  between the third and fourth week the heart tube lengthens and begins to fold to form an sshape within the pericardium this places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart further development will include the septa and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers by the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and the heart valves are completed by the ninth week  the embryonic heart begins beating at around 22 days after conception 5 weeks after the last normal menstrual period lmp it starts to beat at a rate near to the mothers which is about 7580 beats per minute bpm the embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165185 bpm early in the early 7th week early 9th week after the lmp   after 9 weeks start of the fetal stage it starts to decelerate slowing to around 145 25 bpm at birth there is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth   the heart functions as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous circulation of blood throughout the body this circulation consists of the systemic circulation to and from the body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration the systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs  the right heart collects deoxygenated blood from two large veins the superior and inferior venae cavae the blood collects in the right atrium and is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle where it is pumped into the pulmonary artery through the pulmonary valve here the blood enters the pulmonary circulation where carbon dioxide can be exchanged for oxygen in the lungs this happens through the passive process of diffusion in the left heart oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins it is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation the aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries arterioles and ultimately capillaries in the capillaries oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products  the cardiac cycle refers to a complete heartbeat which includes systole and diastole and the intervening pause the cycle begins with contraction of the atria and ends with relaxation of the ventricles systole is when the ventricles of the heart contract to pump blood to the body diastole is when the ventricles relax and fill with blood the atria and ventricles work in concert so in systole when the ventricles are contracting the atria are relaxed and collecting blood when the ventricles are relaxed in diastole the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles this coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body  at the beginning of the cardiac cycle in early diastole both the atria and ventricles are relaxed since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure when the chambers are relaxed blood will flow into the atria through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins as the atria begin to fill the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles in late diastole the atria contract pumping more blood into the ventricles this causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles and in ventricular systole blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery when the atrioventricular valves tricuspid and mitral are open during blood flow to the ventricles the semilunar valves are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles when the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut when the ventricles contract the pressure forces the semilunar aortic and pulmonary valves open as the ventricles relax the semilunar valves will close in response to decreased pressure cardiac output co is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle stroke volume in one minute this is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume sv by the beats per minute of the heart rate hr so that co  sv x hr  the average cardiac output using an average sv of about 70ml is 525 lmin with a range of 4080 lmin  the stroke volume is normally measured using an echocardiogram and can be influenced by the size of the heart physical and mental condition of the individual sex contractility duration of contraction preload and afterload  preload refers to how much blood is in the ventricles at the end of diastole when they are at their fullest a main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fillif the ventricles contract faster then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less  preload can also be affected by a persons hydration status  it is important because of the frankstarling mechanism this states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber this means that a ventricle will contract more forcefully the more it is stretched  afterload or how much blood is left in the ventricles after systole is influenced by vascular resistance this tension is called afterload it can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves stenosis or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels  the strength of heart muscle contractions controls the stroke volume this can be influenced positively or negatively by agents termed inotropes these can be either conditions or drugs positive inotropes that cause stronger contractions include high blood calcium and drugs such as digoxin which will act to stimulate the sympathetic nerves in the fightorflight response negative inotropes causing weaker contractions include high blood potassium hypoxia acidosis and drugs such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers these act on the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve the normal rhythmical heart beat called sinus rhythm is established by the sinoatrial node the hearts pacemaker here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart causing the heart muscle to contract the sinoatrial node is found in the upper part of the right atrium near to the junction with the superior vena cava  the electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood it travels to the left atrium via bachmanns bundle such that both left and right atria contract together    the signal then travels to the atrioventricular node this is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septumthe boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle the septum is part of the cardiac skeleton tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only  the signal then travels along the bundle of his to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart in the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the cardiac muscle  the resting heart rate of a newborn can be 129 beats per minute bpm and this gradually decreases until maturity  the adult resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 bpm exercise and fitness levels age and basal metabolic rate can all affect the heart rate an athletes heart rate can be lower than 60 bpm during exercise the rate can be 150 bpm with maximum rates reaching from 200 to 220 bpm  the sinoatrial node creates and sustains its own rhythm the sinus rhythm cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential the cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes into and out of the pacemaker cells the action potential then spreads to nearby cells when the sinoatrial cells are resting they have a negative charge on their membranes however a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membranes charge to become positive this is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously  once the cell has a sufficiently high charge the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell shortly after which potassium begins to leave it all the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells the potassium and calcium only start to move out of and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge and so are called voltagegated shortly after this the calcium channels close and potassium channels open allowing potassium to leave the cell this causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization when the membrane potential reaches approximately 60 mv the potassium channels close and the process may begin again  the ions move from areas where they are concentrated to where they are not for this reason sodium moves into the cell from outside and potassium moves from within the cell to outside the cell calcium also plays a critical role their influx through slow channels means that the sinoatrial cells have a prolonged plateau phase when they have a positive charge a part of this is called the absolute refractory period calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein troponin c in the troponin complex to enable contraction of the cardiac muscle and separate from the protein to allow relaxation  the normal sinus rhythm of the heart giving the resting heart rate is influenced by the autonomic nervous system through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves  these arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongatathe vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate these come together in the cardiac plexus near the base of the heart without parasympathetic input which normally predominates the sinoatrial node would generate a heart rate of about 100 bpm  the nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the t1t4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes as well as to the atria and ventricles the ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine also known as noradrenaline at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves this shortens the repolarization period thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction which results in an increased heart rate it opens chemical or ligandgated sodium and calcium ion channels allowing an influx of positively charged ions  norepinephrine binds to the beta1 receptor high blood pressure medications are used to block these receptors and so reduce the heart rate  the cardiovascular centres receive input from a series of receptors including proprioreceptors baroreceptors and chemoreceptors plus stimuli from the limbic system through a series of reflexes these help regulate and sustain blood flow for example increased physical activity results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles joint capsules and tendons with increased rates of firing the parasympathetic stimulation may decrease or sympathetic stimulation may increase as needed in order to increase blood flow  similarly baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus carotid bodies the venae cavae and other locations including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure level of physical activity and the relative distribution of blood the cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex with increased pressure and stretch the rate of baroreceptor firing increases and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation as pressure and stretch decrease the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation  there is a similar reflex called the atrial reflex or bainbridge reflex associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located however as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase hr the opposite is also true  in addition to the autonomic nervous system other factors can impact on this these include epinephrine norepinephrine and thyroid hormones levels of various ions including calcium potassium and sodium body temperature hypoxia and ph balance factors that increase the heart rate can include release of norepinephrine hypoxemia low blood pressure and dehydration a strong emotional response a higher body temperature and metabolic and hormonal factors such as a low potassium or sodium level or stimulus from thyroid hormones  decreased body temperature relaxation and metabolic factors can also contribute to a decrease in heart rate  one of the simplest methods of assessing the hearts condition is to listen to it using a stethoscope  in a healthy heart there are only two audible heart sounds called s1 and s2 the first heart sound s1 is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as lub the second heart sound s2 is the sound of the semilunar valves closing during ventricular diastole and is described as dub  each sound consists of two components reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close  s2 may split into two distinct sounds either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems  additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to gallop rhythms a third heart sound s3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume a fourth heart sound s4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle the combined presence of s3 and s4 give a quadruple gallop  heart murmurs are abnormal heart sounds which can be either pathological or benign  one example of a murmur is stills murmur which presents a musical sound in children has no symptoms and disappears in adolescence  a different type of sound a pericardial friction rub can be heard in cases of pericarditis where the inflamed membranes can rub together  being such a complex organ the heart is prone to several cardiovascular diseases some becoming more prevalent with ageing  heart disease is a major cause of death accounting for an average of 30 of all deaths in 2008 globally  this rate varies from a lower 28 to a high 40 in highincome countries  doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart including doctors such as general practitioners cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians obesity high blood pressure and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing heart disease however half the number of heart attacks occur in people with normal cholesterol levels it is generally accepted that factors such as exercise or the lack of it good or poor diet and overall wellbeing including emotional affect heart health     exercise results in the addition of protein myofilaments and this can result in hypertrophy where the size of individual cells are increased but not their number  this is a condition known as athletic heart syndrome the hearts of athletes can pump more efficiently at lower heart rates however enlarged hearts can have a pathological cause such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which can result in a heart of 1000g 2lb in mass  the cause of an abnormally enlarged heart muscle is unknown but the condition is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes  coronary artery disease is also known as ischemic heart disease and atherosclerotic disease and is the most common form of heart disease the underlying mechanism of this disease is atherosclerosisa buildup of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them reducing the blood flow to the heart it is the leading cause of heart attacks and the most common cause of death globally  it is also the main cause of angina cardiomyopathy and most commonly dilated cardiomyopathy is a noticeable deterioration of the heart muscles ability to contract which can lead to heart failure   other common causes of heart failure which can also be congestive are heart attacks valve disorders and high blood pressure this happens when the heart is pumping insufficiently and cannot meet the bodys blood flow demands  because the heart is a double pump each side can fail independently of the other resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart either of which through causing strain in the other side can result in the failure of the whole heart congestive heart failure results in blood backing up in the systemic circulation edema swelling of the feet ankles and fingers is the most noticeable symptom pulmonary congestion results from left heart failure the right side of the heart continues to propel blood to the lungs but the left side is unable to pump the returning blood into the systemic circulation as blood vessels within the lungs become swollen with blood the pressure within them increases and fluid leaks from the circulation into the lung tissue this pleural effusion causes pulmonary edema if untreated the person will suffocate because they are drowning in their own blood  heart murmurs are abnormal heart sounds which can be either pathological or benign and there are several kinds  murmurs are graded by volume from 1 the quietest to 6 the loudest and evaluated by their relationship to the heart sounds and position in the cardiac cycle  phonocardiograms can record these sounds  murmurs can result from valvular heart diseases due to narrowing stenosis regurgitation or insufficiency of any of the main heart valves but they can also result from a number of other disorders including atrial and ventricular septal defects  abnormalities in the sinus rhythm can prevent the heart from effectively pumping blood and cause both atrial and ventricular fibrillation  examples of cardiac arhythmias are a very rapid heart rate tachycardia and a very slow heart rate bradycardia tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60  asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm which results in cardiac arrest cardiac arrest can be diagnosed by pulseless electrical activity showing on an echocardiogram cardiac tamponade also known as pericardial tamponade is the condition of an abnormal buildup of fluid in the pericardium which can adversely affect the function of the heart the fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis carditis is inflammation of the heart this can be specific to regions as in pericarditis myocarditis and endocarditis or it can be of the whole heart known as pancarditis tetralogy of fallot is a congenital cyanotic heart defect and the most common cause of blue baby syndrome  diagnosis of the various conditions can be made by assessing the presented symptoms initially by cardiac examination the taking of a medical history is also of importance further examination can involve blood tests echocardiograms ecgs and imaging cardiac catheterisation can assist for example in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis the cardiac examination includes inspection palpation and auscultation using surface electrodes on the body it is possible to record the complex electrical activity of the heart this tracing of the electrical signal is the electrocardiogram ecg or ekg an ecg clearly shows normal and abnormal heart function and is an indispensable diagnostic tool there are five prominent points on the ecg the p wave atrial depolarisation the qrs complex atrial repolarisation and ventricular depolarisation and the t wave ventricular repolarisation  several imaging methods can be used to assess the anatomy and function of the heart including angiography pet ct mri and ultrasound echocardiography an echocardiogram is used to measure the hearts function assess for valve disease and look for any abnormalities echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest transthoracic or by a probe in the esophagus transoesophageal a typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis whether there is any backflow of blood regurgitation and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole including an ejection fraction which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart stroke volume by the volume of the filled heart enddiastolic volume  a cardiac stress test uses exercise or drugs to stimulate the heart and provoke a measurable response to the stress in order to gauge the hearts effectiveness angiogenesis represents a therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease  defibrillation is used to treat serious arrhythmias artificial pacemakers used to regulate the heartbeat can also incorporate a defibrillator coronary artery bypass surgery to improve the blood supply to the heart is often the only treatment option for coronary heart disease heart valve repair or valve replacement are options for valvular heart disease the valves of the heart were discovered by a physician of the hippocratean school around the 4th century bc although their function was not fully understood on dissection arteries are typically empty of blood because blood pools in the veins after death it was subsequently assumed they were filled with air and served to transport air around the body philosophers distinguished veins from arteries but thought the pulse was a property of arteries erasistratos observed that arteries cut during life bleed he ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is replaced with blood which entered by very small vessels between veins and arteries thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow of blood the greek physician galen 2nd century ad knew blood vessels carried blood and identified venous dark red and arterial brighter and thinner blood each with distinct and separate functions growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle while arterial blood gave vitality by containing pneuma air and originated in the heart blood flowed from both creating organs to all parts of the body where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver the heart did not pump blood around the hearts motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through pores in the interventricular septum while air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart as the arterial blood was created sooty vapors were created and passed to the lungs also via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled the earliest descriptions of the coronary and pulmonary circulation systems can be found in the commentary on anatomy in avicennas canon published in 1242 by ibn alnafis  in his manuscript alnafis wrote that blood passes through the pulmonary circulation instead of moving from the right to the left ventricle as previously believed by galen  his work was later translated into latin by andrea alpago  in europe the teachings of galen continued to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the church andreas vesalius questioned some of galens beliefs of the heart in de humani corporis fabrica 1543 but his magnum opus was interpreted as a challenge to the authorities and he was subjected to a number of attacks  michael servetus wrote in christianismi restitutio 1553 that blood flows from one side of the heart to the other via the lungs  the breakthrough came with the publication of de motu cordis 1628 by the english physician william harvey harveys book completely describes the systemic circulation and the mechanical force of the heart leading to an overhaul of the galenic doctrines  otto frank 18651944 was a german physiologist among his many published works are detailed studies of this important heart relationship ernest starling 18661927 was an important english physiologist who also studied the heart although they worked largely independently their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been recognized in the name frankstarling mechanism  although purkinje fibers and the bundle of his were discovered as early as the 19th century their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until sunao tawara published his monograph titled das reizleitungssystem des säugetierherzens in 1906 tawaras discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted arthur keith and martin flack to look for similar structures in the heart leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later these structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram whose inventor willem einthoven was awarded the nobel prize in medicine or physiology in 1924  the first successful heart transplantation was performed in 1967 by the south african surgeon christiaan barnard at groote schuur hospital in cape town this marked an important milestone in cardiac surgery capturing the attention of both the medical profession and the world at large however longterm survival rates of patients were initially very low louis washkansky the first recipient of a donated heart died 18 days after the operation while other patients did not survive for more than a few weeks  the american surgeon norman shumway has been credited for his efforts to improve transplantation techniques along with pioneers richard lower vladimir demikhov and adrian kantrowitz as of march 2000 more than 55000 heart transplantations have been performed worldwide  by the middle of the 20th century heart disease had surpassed infectious disease as the leading cause of death in the united states and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide since 1948 the ongoing framingham heart study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart including diet exercise and common medications such as aspirin although the introduction of ace inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden with 30 to 40 of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis  as one of the vital organs the heart was long identified as the center of the entire body the seat of life or emotion or reason will intellect purpose or the mind thus in the hebrew bible the word for heart \u05dc\u05d1\u05d1 lebab is used in these meanings paralleling the use of \u03c6\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd diaphragm in homeric greek an important part of the concept of the soul in ancient egyptian religion was thought to be the heart or ib the ib or metaphysical heart was believed to be formed from one drop of blood from the childs mothers heart taken at conception  to ancient egyptians the heart was the seat of emotion thought will and intention this is evidenced by egyptian expressions which incorporate the word ib such as awtib for happiness literally wideness of heart xakib for estranged literally truncated of heart  in egyptian religion the heart was the key to the afterlife it was conceived as surviving death in the nether world where it gave evidence for or against its possessor it was thought that the heart was examined by anubis and the deities during the weighing of the heart ceremony if the heart weighed more than the feather of maat it was immediately consumed by the monster ammit the chinese character for heart \u5fc3 derives from a comparatively realistic depiction of a heart indicating the heart chambers in seal script the chinese word x\u012bn also takes the metaphorical meanings of mind intelligence soul or center core in chinese medicine the heart is seen as the center of \u795e shén spirit soul consciousness the sanskrit word for heart hrd \u0939\u0926 dates at least as far back as the rigveda and is a cognate of the word for heart in greek latin and english the same word is used to mean mind or soul depending on the context many classical philosophers and scientists including aristotle considered the heart the seat of thought reason or emotion often disregarding the brain as contributing to those functions  the identification of the heart as the seat of emotions in particular is due to the roman physician galen who also located the seat of the passions in the liver and the seat of reason in the brain  however these emotional properties of the heart were later discovered to be solely centered in the brain this tradition influenced the development of the medieval christian devotion to the sacred heart of jesus and the immaculate heart of mary the idiomatic expression of pierced or broken hearts ultimately derive from devotional christianity where the hearts of mary or jesus are depicted as suffering various tortures symbolizing the pain suffered by christ for the sins of the world and the pain of mary at the crucifixion of her son respectively but from an early time the metaphor was transferred to unfulfilled romantic love in late medieval literature dealing with the ideals of courtly love the notion of cupids arrows is ancient due to ovid but while ovid describes cupid as wounding his victims with his arrows it is not made explicit that it is the heart that is wounded the familiar iconography of cupid shooting little heart symbols is baroque  animal hearts are widely consumed as food as they are almost entirely muscle they are high in protein they are often included in dishes with other offal for example in the panottoman kokoretsi chicken hearts are considered to be giblets and are often grilled on skewers japanese h\u0101to yakitori brazilian churrasco de coração indonesian chicken heart satay  they can also be panfried as in jerusalem mixed grill in egyptian cuisine they can be used finely chopped as part of stuffing for chicken  many recipes combined them with other giblets such as the mexican pollo en menudencias  and the russian ragu iz kurinyikh potrokhov  the hearts of beef pork and mutton can generally be interchanged in recipes as heart is a hardworking muscle it makes for firm and rather dry meat  so is generally slowcooked another way of dealing with toughness is to julienne the meat as in chinese stirfried heart  beef heart may be grilled or braised  in the peruvian anticuchos de corazón barbecued beef hearts are grilled after being tenderized through long marination in a spice and vinegar mixture an australian recipe for mock goose is actually braised stuffed beef heart  pig heart is stewed poached braised  or made into sausage the balinese oret is a sort of blood sausage made with pig heart and blood a french recipe for c\u0153ur de porc à lorange is made of braised heart with an orange sauce the structure of the heart can vary among the different animal species cephalopods have two gill hearts also known as branchial hearts and one systemic heart the vertebrate heart lies in the front ventral part of the body cavity dorsal to the gut it is always surrounded by a pericardium which is usually a distinct structure but may be continuous with the peritoneum in jawless and cartilaginous fish the sa node is found in all amniotes but not in more primitive vertebrates in these animals the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers indeed since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes it is likely homologous with the sa node in teleosts with their vestigial sinus venosus the main centre of coordination is instead in the atrium the rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species ranging from around 20 beats per minute in codfish to around 600 in hummingbirds  and up to 1200 bpm in the rubythroated hummingbird  in the heart of lungfish the septum extends partway into the ventricle this allows for some degree of separation between the deoxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered to the rest of the body the absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin thus the blood returned to the heart through the vena cavae is already partially oxygenated as a result there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods nonetheless in at least some species of amphibian the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams also the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate  adult amphibians and most reptiles have a double circulatory system but the heart is not separated into two pumps the development of the double system is necessitated by the presence of lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart in amphibians the atrium is divided into two chambers by a muscular septum but there is only one ventricle the sinus venosus which remains large connects only to the right atrium and receives blood from the venae cavae with the pulmonary vein bypassing it to enter the left atrium the heart of most reptiles is similar in structure to that of lungfish but the septum is generally much larger this divides the ventricle into two halves but the septum does not reach the whole length of the heart and there is a considerable gap near the pulmonary artery and aorta openings in most reptilian species there appears to be little if any mixing between the bloodstreams so the aorta receives essentially only oxygenated blood  archosaurs crocodilians and birds and mammals show complete separation of the heart into two pumps for a total of four heart chambers it is thought that the fourchambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals in crocodilians there is a small opening the foramen of panizza at the base of the arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart during a dive underwater   thus only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood  those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations  permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier  primitive fish have a fourchambered heart but the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the fourchambered hearts of mammals and birds the first chamber is the sinus venosus which collects deoxygenated blood from the body through the hepatic and cardinal veins from here blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place the fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta the ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows through the dorsal aorta into the rest of the body in tetrapods the ventral aorta has divided in two one half forms the ascending aorta while the other forms the pulmonary artery  in the adult fish the four chambers are not arranged in a straight row but instead form an sshape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two this relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the rayfinned fish in teleosts the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper the conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution similarly while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable  arthropods have an open circulatory system and often some short openended arteriesthe arthropod heart is typically a muscular tube that runs the length of the body under the back and from the base of the head instead of blood the circulatory fluid is haemolymph which carries the most commonly used respiratory pigment copperbased haemocyanin as the oxygen transporter ironbased haemoglobin is used by only a few arthropods the heart contracts in ripples from the rear to the front of the animal transporting water and nutrients pairs of valves run alongside the heart allowing fluid to enter whilst preventing backflow in insects the circulatory system is not used to transport oxygen and so is much reduced having no veins or arteries and consisting of a single perforated tube running dorsally which pumps peristaltically the simpler unsegmented invertebrates have no body cavity and oxygen and nutrients pass through their bodies by diffusion the human heart viewed from the front the human

V chronic kidney disease ckd also known as chronic renal disease is progressive loss in kidney function over a period of months or years the symptoms of worsening kidney function are not specific and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite often chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a blood relative with ckd this disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications such as cardiovascular disease anemia or pericarditis  it is a longterm form of kidney disease thus it is differentiated from acute kidney disease acute kidney injury in that the reduction in kidney function must be present for over 3 months chronic kidney disease is identified by a blood test for creatinine which is a breakdown product of muscle metabolism higher levels of creatinine indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate and as a result a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products creatinine levels may be normal in the early stages of ckd and the condition is discovered if urinalysis testing of a urine sample shows the kidney is allowing the loss of protein or red blood cells into the urine to fully investigate the underlying cause of kidney damage various forms of medical imaging blood tests and sometimes a kidney biopsy removing a small sample of kidney tissue are employed to find out if a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction is present  recent professional guidelines classify the severity of ckd in five stages with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated stage 5 ckd is often called endstage kidney disease endstage renal disease or endstage kidney failure and is largely synonymous with the now outdated terms chronic renal failure or chronic kidney failure and usually means the patient requires renal replacement therapy which may involve a form of dialysis but ideally constitutes a kidney transplant screening of atrisk people is important because treatments exist that delay the progression of ckd  if an underlying cause of ckd such as vasculitis or obstructive nephropathy blockage to the drainage system of the kidneys is found it may be treated directly to slow the damage in more advanced stages treatments may be required for anemia and kidney bone disease also called renal osteodystrophy secondary hyperparathyroidism or chronic kidney disease  mineral bone disorder ckdmbd chronic kidney disease resulted in 956000 deaths in 2013 up from 409000 deaths in 1990    ckd is initially without specific symptoms and is generally only detected as an increase in serum creatinine or protein in the urine as the kidney function decreases people with ckd suffer from accelerated atherosclerosis and are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than the general population patients afflicted with ckd and cardiovascular disease tend to have significantly worse prognoses than those suffering only from the latter  sexual dysfunction is very common in both men and women with ckd a majority of men have a reduced sex drive difficulty obtaining an erection and reaching orgasm and the problems get worse with age a majority of women have trouble with sexual arousal and painful menstruation and problems with performing and enjoying sex are common  the most common recognised cause of ckd is diabetes mellitus others include idiopathic ie unknown cause often associated with small kidneys on renal ultrasound hypertension and glomerulonephritis  together these cause about 75 of all adult cases historically kidney disease has been classified according to the part of the kidney anatomy involved  diagnosis of ckd is largely based on the clinical picture combined with the measurement of the serum creatinine level see above in many ckd patients previous kidney disease or other underlying diseases are already known a significant number present with ckd of unknown cause in these patients a cause is occasionally identified retrospectively  it is important to differentiate ckd from acute kidney injury aki because aki can be reversible abdominal ultrasound in which the size of the kidneys is measured is commonly performed kidneys with ckd are usually smaller  9cm than normal kidneys with notable exceptions such as in early diabetic nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease another diagnostic clue that helps differentiate ckd from aki is a gradual rise in serum creatinine over several months or years as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum creatinine several days to weeks if these levels are unavailable because the patient has been well and has had no blood tests it is occasionally necessary to treat a patient briefly as having aki until the kidney impairment has been established to be irreversible  additional tests may include nuclear medicine mag3 scan to confirm blood flow and establish the differential function between the two kidneys dimercaptosuccinic acid dmsa scans are also used in kidney imaging with both mag3 and dmsa being used chelated with the radioactive element technetium99  in ckd numerous uremic toxins accumulate in the blood even when eskd largely synonymous with ckd5 is treated with dialysis the toxin levels do not go back to normal as dialysis is not that efficient similarly after a kidney transplant the levels may not go back to normal as the transplanted kidney may not work 100 if it does the creatinine level is often normal the toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum and have different molecular weights and some of them are bound to other proteins primarily to albumin such toxic proteinbound substances are receiving the attention of scientists who are interested in improving the standard chronic dialysis procedures used today  screening those who have neither symptoms nor risk factors for ckd is not recommended  those who should be screened include those with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease those with diabetes or marked obesity those aged  60 years subjects with indigenous racial origin  those with a history of kidney disease in the past and subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis screening should include calculation of estimated gfr from the serum creatinine level and measurement of urine albumintocreatinine ratio acr in a firstmorning urine specimen this reflects the amount of a protein called albumin in the urine as well as a urine dipstick screen for hematuria  the gfr glomerular filtration rate is derived from the serum creatinine and is proportional to 1creatinine ie it is a reciprocal relationship the higher the creatinine the lower the gfr it reflects one aspect of kidney function how efficiently the glomeruli filtering units work but as they make up 5 of the mass of the kidney the gfr does not tell you about all aspects of kidney health and function this can be done by combining the gfr level with the clinical assessment of the patient especially fluid state and measuring the levels of hemoglobin potassium phosphate and parathyroid hormone pth normal gfr is 90120 mlsmin the units of creatinine vary from country to country guidelines for referral to a nephrologist vary between countries though most would agree that nephrology referral is required by stage 4 ckd when egfr173m  is less than 30 mlmin or decreasing by more than 3 mlminyear and may be useful at an earlier stage eg ckd3 when urine albumintocreatinine ratio is more than 30mgmmol when blood pressure is difficult to control or when hematuria or other findings suggest either a primarily glomerular disorder or secondary disease amenable to specific treatment other benefits of early nephrology referral include proper patient education regarding options for renal replacement therapy as well as preemptive transplantation and timely workup and placement of an arteriovenous fistula in those patients opting for future hemodialysis all individuals with a glomerular filtration rate gfr 60 mlmin173 m  for 3 months are classified as having chronic kidney disease irrespective of the presence or absence of kidney damage the rationale for including these individuals is that reduction in kidney function to this level or lower represents loss of half or more of the adult level of normal kidney function which may be associated with a number of complications such as the development of cardiovascular disease  the loss of protein in the urine is regarded as an independent marker for worsening of kidney function and cardiovascular disease hence british guidelines append the letter p to the stage of chronic kidney disease if protein loss is significant  slightly diminished function kidney damage with normal or relatively high gfr 90 mlmin173 m  kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies  mild reduction in gfr 6089 mlmin173 m  with kidney damage kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies  moderate reduction in gfr 3059 mlmin173 m   british guidelines distinguish between stage 3a gfr 4559 and stage 3b gfr 3044 for purposes of screening and referral  severe reduction in gfr 1529 mlmin173 m   preparation for renal replacement therapy established kidney failure gfr 15 mlmin173 m  permanent renal replacement therapy  or endstage kidney disease the term nondialysisdependent chronic kidney disease nddckd is a designation used to encompass the status of those persons with an established ckd who do not yet require the lifesupporting treatments for kidney failure known as renal replacement therapy rrt including maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation the condition of individuals with ckd who require either of the two types of renal replacement therapy dialysis or transplant is referred to as the endstage kidney disease eskd hence the start of the eskd is practically the irreversible conclusion of the nddckd even though the nddckd status refers to the status of persons with earlier stages of ckd stages 1 to 4 patients with advanced stage of ckd stage 5 who have not yet started renal replacement therapy are also referred to as nddckd the presence of ckd confers a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease and people with ckd often have other risk factors for heart disease such as high blood lipids the most common cause of death in people with ckd is cardiovascular disease rather than kidney failure aggressive treatment of hyperlipidemia is warranted  apart from controlling other risk factors the goal of therapy is to slow down or halt the progression of ckd to stage 5 control of blood pressure and treatment of the original disease whenever feasible are the broad principles of management generally angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis or angiotensin ii receptor antagonists arbs are used as they have been found to slow the progression of ckd to kidney failure  they have also been found to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction stroke heart failure and death from cardiovascular disease when compared to placebo in individuals with ckd  furthermore aceis may be superior to arbs for protection against progression to kidney failure and death from any cause in those with ckd  although the use of ace inhibitors and arbs represents the current standard of care for people with ckd people progressively lose kidney function while on these medications as seen in the idnt  and renal  studies which reported a decrease over time in estimated gfr an accurate measure of ckd progression as detailed in the kdoqi guidelines  in people treated by these conventional methods replacement of erythropoietin and calcitriol two hormones processed by the kidney is often necessary in people with advanced disease guidelines  recommend treatment with parenteral iron prior to treatment with erythropoietin a target hemoglobin level of 912 gdl is recommended   the normalization of hemoglobin has not been found to be of benefit  it is unclear if androgens help with anemia  phosphate binders are also used to control the serum phosphate levels which are usually elevated in advanced chronic kidney disease although the evidence for them is limited phosphodiesterase5 inhibitors and zinc show potential for helping men with sexual dysfunction  at stage 5 ckd renal replacement therapy is usually required in the form of either dialysis or a transplant the prognosis of patients with chronic kidney disease is guarded as epidemiological data have shown that all cause mortality the overall death rate increases as kidney function decreases  the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease is cardiovascular disease regardless of whether there is progression to stage 5    while renal replacement therapies can maintain patients indefinitely and prolong life the quality of life is severely affected   kidney transplantation increases the survival of patients with stage 5 ckd significantly when compared to other therapeutic options   however it is associated with an increased shortterm mortality due to complications of the surgery transplantation aside highintensity home hemodialysis appears to be associated with improved survival and a greater quality of life when compared to the conventional threetimesaweek hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis  patients with eskd are at increased overall risk for cancer  this risk is particularly high in younger patients and gradually diminishes with age  medical specialty professional organizations recommend that physicians do not perform routine cancer screening in patients with limited life expectancies due to eskd because evidence does not show that such tests lead to improved patient outcomes   chronic kidney disease resulted in 956000 deaths in 2013 up from 409000 deaths in 1990  in canada 19 to 23 million people have ckd  the us centers for disease control and prevention found that ckd affected an estimated 168 of us adults aged 20 years and older during 1999 to 2004  uk estimates suggest that 88 of the population of great britain and northern ireland have symptomatic ckd  ckd is a major concern in african americans mostly due to increased prevalence of hypertension as an example 37 of eskd cases in african americans can be attributed to high blood pressure compared with 19 among caucasians  treatment efficacy also differs between racial groups administration of antihypertensive drugs generally halts disease progression in white populations but has little effect in slowing kidney disease among blacks and additional treatment such as bicarbonate therapy is often required  while lower socioeconomic status contributes to prevalence of ckd significant differences in ckd prevalence are still evident between african americans and whites when controlling for environmental factors  studies have shown a true association between history of chronic kidney disease in first or seconddegree relatives and risk of disease  in addition african americans may have higher serum levels of human leukocyte antigens hla  high hla concentrations can contribute to increased systemic inflammation which indirectly may lead to heightened susceptibility for developing kidney disease lack of nocturnal reduction in blood pressure among groups of african americans is also offered as an explanation  which lends further credence to a genetic etiology of ckd racial disparities a high and sofar unexplained incidence of ckd referred to as the mesoamerican nephropathy has been noted among male workers in central america mainly in sugar cane fields in the lowlands of el salvador and nicaragua heat stress from long hours of piecerate work at high average temperatures     in the range of 96f is suspected as are agricultural chemicals   and other factors in sri lanka another epidemic of ckd of unknown etiology has become a serious public health concern  in the usa the national kidney foundation is a national organization representing patients and professionals who treat kidney diseases the american kidney fund is a national nonprofit organization providing treatmentrelated financial assistance to one of every five dialysis patients each year the renal support network is a nonprofit patientfocused patientrun organization that provides nonmedical services to those affected by ckd the american association of kidney patients is a nonprofit patientcentric group focused on improving the health and wellbeing of ckd and dialysis patients the renal physicians association is an association representing nephrology professionals in the united kingdom the uk national kidney federation and british kidney patient association bkpa represents patients and the renal association represents renal physicians and works closely with the national service framework for kidney disease kidney health australia serves that country the international society of nephrology is an international body representing specialists in kidney diseases currently several compounds are in development for the treatment of ckd these include the angiotensin receptor blocker arb olmesartan medoxomil citation needed and

V excerebration is an egyptian mummification procedure of removal of the brain from corpses prior to actual embalming greek writer herodotus a frequent visitor to egypt wrote in the fifth century bc about the process having agreed on a price the bearers go away and the workmen left alone in their place embalm the body if they do this in the most perfect way they first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook and inject certain drugs into the rest  an object more than 3 inches 8 centimeters long probably made from plants in the group monocotyledon including palm and bamboo would have been used for liquefying and removing the brain the instrument would be inserted through a hole punched into the ethmoid bone near the nose some parts of the brain would be wrapped around this stick and pulled out and the other parts would be liquefied the egyptian mummy would then be put on its abdomen and the liquid drained through the nose hole before other embalming procedures

V the cupula is a structure in the vestibular system providing the sense of spatial orientation the cupula is located within the ampullae of each of the three semicircular canals part of the crista ampullaris the cupula has embedded within it hair cells that have several stereocilia associated with each kinocilium the cupula itself is the gelatinous component of the crista ampullaris that extends from the crista to the roof of the ampullae when the head rotates the endolymph filling the semicircular ducts initially lags behind due to inertia as a result the cupula is deflected opposite the direction of head movement as the endolymph pushes the cupula the stereocilia is bent as well stimulating the hair cells within the crista ampullaris after a short time of continual rotation however the endolymphs acceleration normalizes with the rate of rotation of the semicircular ducts as a result the cupula returns to its resting position and the hair cells cease to be stimulated this continues until the head stops rotating which simultaneously halts semicircular duct rotation due to inertia however the endolymph continues on as the endolymph continues to move the cupula is once again deflected resulting in the compensatory movements of the body when spun in each of these situations as fluid rushes by the cupula the hair cells stimulated transmit the corresponding signal to the brain through the vestibulocochlear nerve cn viii in their natural orientation within the head the cupulae are located on the medial aspect of the semicircular canals in this orientation the kinocilia rest on the posterior aspect of the cupula the buoyancy hypothesis posits that alcohol causes vertigo by affecting the neutral buoyancy of the cupula within the surrounding fluid called the endolymph linear accelerations such as that of gravity should not in theory effect a movement of the cupula when it is neutrally buoyant the buoyancy hypothesis assumes that alcohol with a different specific gravity from that of the cupulaendolymph diffuses at different rates into the cupula and the surrounding endolymph the result is a temporary density gradient between the cupula and endolymph and a consequent erroneous sensitivity to linear accelerations such as that of gravity by a system normally signalling rotational accelerations  this sensation is commonly referred to as the spins  this article incorporates text in the public domain from the 20th edition of grays anatomy 1918

V a perivascular space also known as a virchowrobin space is an immunological space between an artery and a vein not capillaries and the pia mater that can be expanded by leukocytes the spaces are formed when large vessels take the pia mater with them when they dive deep into the brain the pia mater is reflected from the surface of the brain onto the surface of blood vessels in the subarachnoid space perivascular cuffs are regions of leukocyte aggregation in the spaces usually found in patients with viral encephalitis perivascular spaces are extremely small and can usually only be seen on mri images when dilated while many normal brains will show a few dilated spaces an increase in these has been shown to correlate with the incidence of several neurodegenerative diseases making the spaces a popular topic of research    perivascular spaces are gaps containing interstitial fluid that span between blood vessels and the brain matter which they penetrate  like the blood vessels around which they form perivascular spaces are found in both the subarachnoid space and the subpial space perivascular spaces surrounding arteries in the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia are separated from the subpial space by one or two layers of leptomeninges respectively as well as the pia mater  by virtue of the leptomeningeal cell layer the perivascular spaces belonging to the subarachnoid space are continuous with those of the subpial space the direct communication between the perivascular spaces of the subarachnoid space and the subpial space is unique to the brains arteries as no leptomeningeal layers surround the brains veins   use of the scanning electron microscope has determined that the spaces surrounding blood vessels in the subarachnoid space are not continuous with the subarachnoid space because of the presence of pia mater cells joined by desmosomes  perivascular spaces may be enlarged to a diameter of five millimeters in healthy humans and are usually harmless when enlarged they can disrupt the function of the brain regions into which they project  dilation can occur on one or both sides of the brain  dilated perivascular spaces are categorized into three types  perivascular spaces are most commonly located in the basal ganglia thalamus midbrain cerebellum hippocampus insular cortex the white matter of the cerebrum and along the optic tract  the ideal method used to visualize perivascular spaces is t2weighted mri the mr images of other neurological disorders can be similar to those of the dilated spaces these disorders are   perivascular spaces are distinguished on an mri by several key features the spaces appear as distinct round or oval entities with a signal intensity visually equivalent to that of cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space    in addition a perivascular space has no mass effect and is located along the blood vessel around which it forms  one of the most basic roles of the perivascular space is the regulation of fluid movement in the central nervous system and its drainage  the spaces ultimately drain fluid from neuronal cell bodies to the cervical lymph nodes  in particular the tide hypothesis suggests that the cardiac contraction creates and maintains pressure waves to modulate the flow to and from the subarachnoid space and the perivascular space  by acting as a sort of sponge they are essential for signal transmission and the maintenance of extracellular fluid  another function is as an integral part of the bloodbrain barrier bbb  while the bbb is often described as the tight junctions between the endothelial cells this is an oversimplification that neglects the intricate role that perivascular spaces take in separating the venous blood from the parenchyma of the brain often cell debris and foreign particles which are impermeable to the bbb will get through the endothelial cells only to be phagocytosed in the perivascular spaces this holds true for many t and b cells as well as monocytes giving this small fluid filled space an important immunological role  perivascular spaces also play an important role in immunoregulation they not only contain interstitial and cerebrospinal fluid but they also have a constant flux of macrophages which is regulated by bloodborne mononuclear cells but do not pass the basement membrane of the glia limitans  similarly as part of its role in signal transmission perivascular spaces contain vasoactive neuropeptides vns which aside from regulating blood pressure and heart rate have an integral role in controlling microglia  vns serve to prevent inflammation by activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase which then produces camp the production of camp aids in the modulation of autoreactive t cells by regulatory t cells   the perivascular space is susceptible space for vn compromise and when their function is reduced in the space immune response is adversely affected and the potential for degradation increases   when inflammation by t cells begins astrocytes begin to undergo apoptosis due to their cd95 receptor to open up the glia limitans and let t cells into the parenchyma of the brain  because this process is aided by the perivascular macrophages these tend to accumulate during neuroinflammation and cause dilation of the spaces  the clinical significance of perivascular spaces comes primarily from their tendency to dilate the importance of dilation is hypothesized to be based on changes in shape rather than size  enlarged spaces have been observed most commonly in the basal ganglia specifically on the lenticulostriate arteries they have also been observed along the paramedial mesencephalothalamic artery and the substantia nigra in the mesencephalon the brain region below the insula the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum and the corpus callosum as well as the brain region directly above it the cingulate gyrus  upon the clinical application of mri it was shown in several studies that perivascular space dilation and lacunar strokes are the most commonly observed histological correlates of signaling abnormalities  dilation is most commonly and closely associated with aging dilation of perivascular spaces has been shown to correlate best with age even when accompanying factors including hypertension dementia and white matter lesions are considered  in the elderly such dilation has been correlated with many symptoms and conditions which often affect the arterial walls including vascular hypertension arteriosclerosis reduced cognitive capacity dementia and low postmortem brain weight  in addition to dilation among the elderly dilation in young healthy individuals can also be observed this occurrence is rare and there has been no observed association in such cases with reduced cognitive function or white matter abnormalities  when dilated vrs are observed in the corpus callosum there is generally no neurological deficit associated they are often observed in this region as cystic lesions with cerebrospinallike fluid  extreme dilation has been associated with several specific clinical symptoms in cases of severe dilation in only one hemisphere symptoms reported include a nonspecific fainting attack hypertension positional vertigo headache early recall disturbances and hemifacial tics symptoms associated with severe bilateral dilation include ear pain which was reported to have resolved on its own dementia and seizures this data was compiled from case studies of individuals with severe vrs dilation  considering the anatomical abnormality presented in such cases these findings were considered surprising in that the symptoms were relatively mild in most cases there is in fact to mass effect associated with some vrs dilation an exception to the mildness of clinical symptoms associated with vrs dilation is when there is extreme dilation in the lower mesencephalon at the junction between the substantia nigra and cerebral peduncle in such cases mild to moderate obstructive hydrocephalus was reported in most patients associated symptoms ranged from headaches to symptoms more severe than those just discussed in the cases of dilation in the cerebral hemispheres  other general symptoms associated with vrs dilation include headaches dizziness memory impairment poor concentration dementia visual changes oculomotor abnormality tremors seizures limb weakness and ataxia  dilation is a typical characteristic of several diseases and disorders these include diseases from metabolic and genetic disorders such as mannosidosis myotonic dystrophy lowe syndrome and coffinlowry syndrome dilation is also a common characteristic of diseases or disorders of vascular pathologies including cadasil cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy hereditary infantile hemiparesis retinal arteriolar tortuosity and leukoencephalopathy migranes and vascular dementia a third group disorders typically associated with vrs dilation are neuroectodermal syndromes this includes polycystic brains associated with ectodermal dysplasia frontonasal dysplasia and joubert syndrome there is a fourth miscellaneous group of disorders typically associated with dilation which include autism in children megalencephalopathy secondary parkinsons disease recentonset multiple sclerosis and chronic alcoholism because dilation can be associated with several diseases but also observed in healthy patients it is always important in the evaluation of vrs to study the tissue around the dilation via mri and to consider the entire clinical context  much of the current research concerning virchowrobin spaces relates to their known tendency to dilate research is presently being performed in order to determine the exact cause of dilation in these perivascular spaces current theories include mechanical trauma resulting from cerebrospinal fluid pulsation elongation of ectactic penetrating blood vessels and abnormal vascular permeability leading to increased fluid exudation further research has implicated shrinkage or atrophy of surrounding brain tissue perivascular demyelination coiling of the arteries as they age altered permeability of the arterial wall and obstruction of lymphatic drainage pathways  in addition insufficient fluid draining and injury to ischemic perivascular tissue resulting in an ex vacuo effect have been suggested as possible causes for dilated vrs  recent and ongoing research has found associations between enlarged vrs and several disorders at one point in time dilated virchowrobin spaces were so commonly noted in autopsies of persons with dementia they were believed to cause the disease however additional research is currently being performed in order to confirm or refute a direct connection between dilation of vrs and dementia  analysis of vrs may distinguish dementia caused by arteriosclerotic microvascular disease from dementia caused by neurodegenerative disease a 2005 study has evidenced that a substantial amount of vrs in the substantia innominata lentiform nucleus and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia may implicate dementia due to arteriosclerotic microvascular disease in particular ischemic vascular dementia as opposed dementia due to neurodegenerative disease specifically alzheimers disease and frontotemporal dementia thus perhaps vrs dilation can be used to distinguish between diagnoses of vascular dementias and degenerative dementias  some studies have assessed the spatial distribution and prevalence of vrs in people with alzheimers disease versus those without the disease researchers have found that while vrs appear to be correlated with natural aging mr imaging reveals a greater prevalence of vrs in those with alzheimers  cerebral amyloid angiopathy caa a blood vessel failure often associated with alheimers disease utilizes dilated vrs to spread inflammation to the parenchyma because the vrs often have an extra membrane in gray matter the ischemic caa response is often observed in white matter  it has been hypothesized that the structure of vrs in the cerebral cortex may contribute to the development of alzheimers disease in contrast to vrs of the basal ganglia vrs in the cerebral cortex are surrounded by only one layer of leptomeninges as such vrs in the cerebral cortex may drain \u03b2amyloid in interstitial fluid less effectively than vrs in the basal ganglia the lesseffective drainage may lead to the development of the \u03b2amyloid plaques that characterize alzheimers disease in support of this hypothesis studies have noted the greater frequency of \u03b2amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex than in the basal ganglia of alzheimers disease patients  because dilated perivascular spaces are so closely correlated with cerebrovascular disease there is much current research on their use as a diagnostic tool in a recent study of 31 subjects abnormal dilation along with irregular csf pulsation were correlated with those subjects having three or more risk factors for strokes therefore perivascular spaces are a possible novel biomarker for hemorrhagic strokes  cadasil syndrome cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy syndrome is a hereditary stroke condition due to a notch 3 gene mutation on chromosome 19 studies have noted that in comparison to family members lacking the affected haplotype that leads to the condition an increased number of dilated spaces is observed in individuals with cadasil these perivascular spaces are localized primarily in the putamen and temporal subcortical white matter and they appear to correlate with age of the individual with the condition rather than severity of the disease itself  there has been a high risk of stroke associated with dilated perivascular spaces in the elderly according to the framingham stroke risk score  in contrast other studies have concluded that the dilation of these spaces is a normal phenomenon in aging with no association with arterosclerosis this remains therefore an important point of research in the field  similar to the research concerning a potential connection between perivascular spaces and alzheimers mri scans of people recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ms have been studied larger more prevalent spaces have been observed in those with ms  additional studies with similar findings have suggested that the inflammatory cells which contribute to the demyelination that characterizes ms also attack the perivascular spaces studies using advanced mri techniques will be necessary to determine if the perivascular spaces can be implicated as a potential marker of the disease  dilated perivascular spaces are common among the elderly and uncommon in children studies have noted the association between both developmental delay and nonsyndromic autism and enlarged or dilated perivascular spaces   nonsyndromic autism categorizes autistic patients for which there is no known cause  the appearance of perivascular spaces was first noted in 1843 by durand fardel  in 1851 rudolph virchow was the first to provide a detailed description of these microscopic spaces between the outer and innermiddle lamina of the brain vessels charlesphilippe robin confirmed these findings in 1859 and was the first to describe the perivascular spaces as channels that existed in normal anatomy the spaces were called virchowrobin spaces and are still also known as such the immunological significance was discovered by wilhelm his sr in 1865 based on his observations of the flow of interstitial fluid over the spaces to the lymphatic system  for many years after virchowrobin spaces were first described it was thought that they were in free communication with the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space it was later shown with the use of electron microscopy that the pia mater serves as separation between the two upon the application of mri measurements of the differences of signal intensity between the perivascular spaces and cerebrospinal fluid supported these findings  as research technologies continued to expand so too did information regarding their function anatomy and clinical significance

V the preorbital gland is a paired exocrine gland found in many species of hoofed animals which is homologous to the lacrimal gland found in humans these glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black nearly bare skin extending from the medial canthus of each eye they are lined by a combination of sebaceous and sudoriferous glands and they produce secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds  ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a means of communication with other animals   the preorbital gland serves different roles in different species pheromonecontaining secretions from the preorbital gland may serve to establish an animals dominance especially in preparation for breeding  mark its territory or simply to produce a pleasurable sensation to the animal  because of its critical role in scent marking the preorbital gland is usually considered as a type of scent gland a further function of these glands may be to produce antimicrobial compounds to fight against skin pathogens antimicrobial compounds found in these glands may be biosynthesized by the animal itself or by microorganisms that live in these glands    deer have seven major external scent glands distributed throughout their bodies these glands are the forehead glands located on the forehead the preorbital glands located below the eyes the nasal glands located inside the nostrils the interdigital glands located between the toes the preputial gland located inside the foreskin of the deers penis the metatarsal glands located outside of the hind legs and the tarsal glands located inside of the hind legs  though it is not their primary function the salivary glands also function as scent glands deer rely heavily on these scent glands to communicate with other members of their species and possibly even with members of other species a deer may rub its preorbital gland eg on a branch purely for pleasure  the two major species of deer found in north america are the whitetailed deer odocoileus virginianus and the mule deer odocoileus hemionus the most important sense in these animals is olfaction the sense of smellso much so that they have an accessory olfaction system the vomeronasal organ located at the base of the nasal cavity is the sensory organ for this system besides locating food and water deer rely on their two separate olfactory systems to detect the presence of predators as well as to supply them with information about the identity sex dominance status and reproductive status of other deer  the preorbital gland of o virginianus is about 22 millimeters 087in in length while that of o hemionus is roughly 40 millimeters 16in in length in blacktailed deer o h columbianus a subspecies of o hemionus the preorbital gland measures about 32 millimeters 13in  in all of these animals the preorbital glands are surrounded by muscle which is under voluntary control at least to some extent  it is not entirely clear whether the preorbital gland secretions of north american deer emit an odor that is significant in terms of chemical communication most of the time the glands remain in the closed position but they are capable of opening them in certain circumstances for example a rutting male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male female deer often open their glands while caring for their young  in juvenile red deer cervus elaphus the preorbital gland appears to play a role in the response to stress the preorbital gland is closed in a relaxed calf whereas it is opened in a stressed calf  one example of this is the signalling of hunger and satiety fawns open their preorbital glands as a signal that they are hungry and close the gland after feeding when they are no longer hungry  other than during the rut mating season and for the first six months after giving birth the adult indian muntjac muntiacus muntjac is a solitary animal adult males in particular are well spaced and marking grass and bushes with secretions from their preorbital glands appears to be involved in the acquisition and maintenance of territory  the bovids family bovidae comprise some 140 species of ruminants in which at least the males bear unbranched hollow horns covered in a permanent sheath of keratin most species of bovids have means of spacing themselves across their habitat territorial behavior is the most consistent type of spacing behavior  caprids dwarf antelope such as the sheep goats muskox serows gorals and several similar species use their preorbital glands to establish social rank for example when competition arises between two grazing sheep ovis aries they have been observed to nuzzle each others preorbital glands by sending and receiving olfactory cues this behavior appears to be a means of establishing dominance and of avoiding a fight which would otherwise involve potentially injurious butting or clashing with the forehead  the antilopine bovids dwarf antelope such as the springbok blackbuck gazelles dikdiks oribi and several similar species have welldeveloped preorbital glands  among the cephalophines members of the philantomba and sylvicapra genera are all solitary animals which display territorial behavior and have well developed preorbital glands maxwells duiker philantomba maxwellii is a solitary animal which utilizes preorbital gland secretions to mark its territory this behavior is observed most in adult males less frequently in females and less still in subadults of this species  secretions from the preorbital gland of the common duiker contain at least 33 different chemical compounds two thiazole compounds and an epoxy ketone are present in significantly higher concentrations in male than in female secretions suggesting that they could serve as sex recognition cues  the alcephine bovids wildebeests hartebeests hirola bontebok blesbok and several similar species have preorbital glands which secrete complex mixtures of chemical compounds  the preorbital glands of the bontebok damaliscus pygargus pygarus are larger in males than in females their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds and are deposited on grass and twigs at the borders of their territory they then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns and forehead by waving the head from side to side across the stalk bearing the secretion marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes  in contrast to the duikers and raphicerids the klipspringer oreotragus oreotragus is a semigregarious species while the hirola beatragus hunteri is fully gregarious nevertheless these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands   differences in the social structure and marking behavior among different species may lead to a different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animals face for example günthers dikdik madoqua guentheri is a monogamous species of antelope that lives in a permanent territory the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and lowlying plants and applying the secretions in this territorial animal the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year the glands are located in large preorbital pits in the lacrimal bone and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively in contrast the saiga antelope saiga tatarica is a polygamous and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory at any time during the year for most of the year the preorbital glands remain small only growing to substantial size during the rut at that time of year secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands in this nonterritorial animal the preorbital glands are not as welldeveloped lack welldeveloped surrounding facial muscles and are positioned in an inconspicuous and shallow depression of the lacrimal bone  the recent identification of several antimicrobial compounds from the secretions of animal dermal scent glands may be the beginning of a promising new area of drug development assuming functional analogs of these lead compounds can be synthesized and found to be effective in vivo the potential exists for producing new antimicrobial agents against pathogenic skin microorganisms

V acute liver failure is the appearance of severe complications rapidly after the first signs of liver disease such as jaundice and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage loss of function of 8090 of liver cells the complications are hepatic encephalopathy and impaired protein synthesis as measured by the levels of serum albumin and the prothrombin time in the blood the 1993 classification defines hyperacute as within 1 week acute as 828 days and subacute as 412 weeks  it reflects the fact that the pace of disease evolution strongly influences prognosis underlying etiology is the other significant determinant of outcome    acute liver failure is defined as the rapid development of hepatocellular dysfunction specifically coagulopathy and mental status changes encephalopathy in a patient without known prior liver disease   the diagnosis of acute liver failure is based on physical exam laboratory findings patient history and past medical history to establish mental status changes coagulopathy rapidity of onset and absence of known prior liver disease respectively   the exact definition of rapid is somewhat questionable and different subdivisions exist which are based on the time from onset of first hepatic symptoms to onset of encephalopathy one scheme defines acute hepatic failure as the development of encephalopathy within 26 weeks of the onset of any hepatic symptoms this is subdivided into fulminant hepatic failure which requires onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks and subfulminant which describes onset of encephalopathy after 8 weeks but before 26 weeks  another scheme defines hyperacute as onset within 7 days acute as onset between 7 and 28 days and subacute as onset between 28 days and 24 weeks   in alf cerebral oedema leads to hepatic encephalopathy coma brain herniation and eventually death detection of encephalopathy is central to the diagnosis of alf it may vary from subtle deficit in higher brain function eg mood concentration in grade i to deep coma grade iv patients presenting as acute and hyperacute liver failure are at greater risk of developing cerebral oedema and grade iv encephalopathy the pathogenesis remains unclear but is likely to be a consequence of several phenomena there is a buildup of toxic substances like ammonia mercaptan  endogenous benzodiazepines and serotonintryptophan in the brain this affects neurotransmitter level and neuroreceptor activation autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired and is associated with anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative stress neuronal cell astrocytes are susceptible to these changes and they swell up resulting in increased intracranial pressure inflammatory mediators also play important role    unfortunately signs of elevated intracranial pressure such as papilloedema and loss of pupillary reflexes are not reliable and occur late in the disease process ct imaging of the brain is also unhelpful in detecting early cerebral oedema but is often performed to rule out intracerebral bleeding invasive intracranial pressure monitoring via subdural route is often recommended however the risk of complications must be weighed against the possible benefit 1 fatal haemorrhage  the aim is to maintain intracranial pressures below 25mm hg cerebral perfusion pressures above 50mm hg  coagulopathy is another cardinal feature of alf the liver has the central role in synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinolysis hepatocellular necrosis leads to impaired synthesis of many coagulation factors and their inhibitors the former produces a prolongation in prothrombin time which is widely used to monitor severity of hepatic injury there is significant platelet dysfunction with both quantitative and qualitative platelet defects progressive thrombocytopenia with loss of larger and more active platelet is almost universal thrombocytopenia with or without dic increases risk of intracerebral bleeding  renal failure is common present in more than 50 of alf patients either due to original insult such as paracetamol resulting in acute tubular necrosis or from hyperdynamic circulation leading to hepatorenal syndrome or functional renal failure because of impaired production of urea blood urea does not represent degree of renal impairment about 60 of all alf patients fulfil the criteria for systemic inflammatory syndrome irrespective of presence or absence of infection  this often contributes towards multi organ failure impaired host defence mechanism due to impaired opsonisation chemotaxis and intracellular killing substantially increases risk of sepsis bacterial sepsis mostly due to gram positive organisms and fungal sepsis are observed in up to 80 and 30 patients respectively  hyponatraemia is an almost universal finding due to water retention and a shift in intracellular sodium transport from inhibition of nak atpase  hypoglycaemia due to depleted hepatic glycogen store and hyperinsulinaemia hypokalaemia hypophosphataemia and metabolic alkalosis are often present independent of renal function lactic acidosis occurs predominantly in paracetamol also known as acetaminophen overdose hyperdynamic circulation with peripheral vasodilatation from low systemic vascular resistance leads to hypotension there is a compensatory increase in cardiac output adrenal insufficiency has been documented in 60 of alf cases and is likely to contribute in haemodynamic compromise  there is also abnormal oxygen transport and utilization although delivery of oxygen to the tissues is adequate there is a decrease in tissue oxygen uptake resulting in tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis  pulmonary complications occur in up to 50 of patients  severe lung injury and hypoxemia result in high mortality most cases of severe lung injury are due to ards with or without sepsis pulmonary haemorrhage pleural effusions atelectasis and intrapulmonary shunts also contribute to respiratory difficulty in late pregnancy liver function decreases significantly which can be easily monitored by blood tests early clinical manifestations of alf in late pregnancy include hypodynamia decrease in appetite dark amber urine deep jaundice nausea vomiting and abdominal distention  among patients whose deaths were attributed to alf in late pregnancy the majority had experienced vaginal deliveries  common causes for acute liver failure are paracetamol acetaminophen overdose idiosyncratic reaction to medication eg tetracycline troglitazone excessive alcohol consumption severe alcoholic hepatitis viral hepatitis hepatitis a or b  it is extremely uncommon in hepatitis c acute fatty liver of pregnancy and idiopathic without an obvious cause reye syndrome is acute liver failure in a child with a viral infection eg chickenpox it appears that aspirin use may play a significant role wilsons disease hereditary copper accumulation may infrequently present with acute liver failure in the majority of acute liver failure alf there is widespread hepatocellular necrosis beginning in the centrizonal distribution and progressing towards portal tracts the degree of parenchymal inflammation is variable and is proportional to duration of disease   zone 1 periportal occurs in phosphorus poisoning or eclampsia zone 2 midzonal although rare is seen in yellow fever zone 3 centrilobular occurs with ischemic injury toxic effects carbon tetrachloride exposure or chloroform ingestion in acute acetaminophen overdose toxification occurs mostly in zone iii which has the highest level of p450 microenzymes that fact along with zone iiis decreased oxygen level helps to explain why it is preferentially one of the initial sites of damage all patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of moderate to severe acute hepatitis should have immediate measurement of prothrombin time and careful evaluation of mental status if the prothrombin time is prolonged by  46 seconds or more inr  15 and there is any evidence of altered sensorium the diagnosis of alf should be strongly suspected and hospital admission is mandatory  initial laboratory examination must be extensive in order to evaluate both the aetiology and severity history taking should include careful review of possible exposures to viral infection and drugs or other toxins from history and clinical examination possibility of underlying chronic disease should be ruled out as it may require different management a liver biopsy done via the transjugular route because of coagulopathy is not usually necessary other than in occasional malignancies as the evaluation continues several important decisions have to be made such as whether to admit the patient to an icu or whether to transfer the patient to a transplant facility consultation with the transplant centre as early as possible is critical due to possibility of rapid progression of alf for liver transplantation in acute liver failure  ph  73 orprothrombin time  100 seconds andserum creatinine level  34mgdl  300 \u03bcmollif in grade iii or iv encephalopathy prothrombin time  100 seconds orthree of the following variables because alf often involves the rapid deterioration of mental status and the potential for multiorgan failure patients should be managed in the intensive care unit  for patients not at a transplant center the possibility of rapid progression of alf makes early consultation with a transplant facility critical accordingly plans for transfer to a transplant center should begin in patients with any abnormal mentation early institution of antidotes or specific therapy may prevent the need for liver transplantation and reduce the likelihood of poor outcome measures appropriate for specific causes of alf are described in detail later in this chapter  patients with grade iii encephalopathy should be transferred to a liver transplant facility and listed for transplantation consider a brain computed tomography ct scan to rule out other causes of decreased mental status stimulation and overhydration can cause elevations in intracranial pressure icp and should be avoided unmanageable agitation may be treated with shortacting benzodiazepines in small doses lactulose can be considered at this stage a preliminary report from the alfsg on 117 patients suggests that use of lactulose in the first 7 days after diagnosis is associated with a small increase in survival time but with no difference in severity of encephalopathy or in overall outcome for patients who progress to grade iiiiv encephalopathy intubation for airway protection is generally required many centers use propofol for sedation because it may reduce cerebral blood the head of the bed should be elevated to 30 degrees and electrolytes blood gases glucose and neurologic status monitored frequently   increased cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance are characteristic of alf pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered hypotension should be treated preferentially with fluids but systemic vasopressor support with agents such as epinephrine norepinephrine or dopamine should be used if fluid replacement fails to maintain mean arterial pressure of 5060mm hg vasoconstrictive agents especially vasopressin should be avoided  pulmonary edema and pulmonary infections are commonly seen in patients with alf mechanical ventilation may be required however positive endexpiratory pressure can worsen cerebral edema  impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors lowgrade fibrinolysis and intravascular coagulation are typical of alf thrombocytopenia is common and may also be dysfunctional replacement therapy is recommended only in the setting of hemorrhage or prior to invasive procedure vitamin k can be given to treat an abnormal prothrombin time regardless of whether there is poor nutritional status administration of recombinant factor viia has shown promise however this treatment approach requires further study the use of gastrointestinal hemorrhage prophylaxis with a histamine2 h2 blocker proton pump inhibitor or sucralfate is recommended  in patients with grade i or ii encephalopathy enteral feeding should be initiated early parenteral nutrition should be used only if enteral feeding is contraindicated as it increases the risk of infection severe restriction of protein is not beneficial 60 gday of protein is generally reasonable fluid replacement with colloid eg albumin is preferred rather than crystalloid eg saline all solutions should contain dextrose to maintain euglycemia multiple electrolyte abnormalities are common in alf correction of hypokalemia is essential as hypokalemia increases renal ammonia production potentially exacerbating encephalopathy hypophosphatemia is especially common in patients with acetaminopheninduced alf and in those with intact renal function hypoglycemia occurs in many patients with alf and is often due to depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis plasma glucose concentration should be monitored and hypertonic glucose administered as needed  bacterial and fungal infections are common in alf with one study demonstrating cultureproven infection in 80 of alf patients defective cellular and humoral immunity as well as presence of indwelling catheters coma broadspectrum antibiotics and medications that suppress immunity all predispose to infection localizing symptoms of infection such as fever and sputum production are frequently absent and the only clues to an underlying infectious process may be worsening of encephalopathy or renal function there must be a low threshold for obtaining frequent cultures blood urine and sputum chest radiographs and paracentesis bacteria that enter through the skin such as streptococci and staphylococci tend to predominate aggressive surveillance is essential as prophylactic antibiotics have shown little benefit fungal infections particularly in the setting of broadspectrum antibiotics are also common and disseminated fungemia is a poor prognostic sign  the advent of transplantation has changed survival from as low as 15 in the pretransplant era to more than 60 today liver transplantation is indicated for many patients with alf and survival rates of 5690 can be achieved in addition to transplantation better critical care and the trend toward more benign causes such as acetaminophen all contribute to improved survival rates spontaneous survival is now around 40 the application of transplantation among patients with alf remains low suggesting that the full potential of this modality may not be realized timely availability of an allograft is one of the major factors determining transplant outcomes in the largest us study only 29 of patients received a liver graft while 10 of the overall group one fourth of patients listed for transplantation died on the waiting list other series have reported death rates of those listed for transplant as high as 40 in the alfsg the transplantation rate was higher in the groups with lower shortterm spontaneous survival making overall survival similar in all groups acetaminophen 73 drug induced 70 indeterminate group 64 and other causes61 causes of death for the 101 patients who died within the 3week period included cerebral edema multiorgan failure sepsis cardiac arrhythmia or arrest and respiratory failure the median time to death after admission was 5 days  intravenous nacetylcysteine has been found to be beneficial in both acetaminophen toxicity and nonacetaminophenrelated acute liver failure  historically mortality has been high being in excess of 80  in recent years the advent of liver transplantation and multidisciplinary intensive care support have improved survival significantly at present overall shortterm survival with transplant is more than 65  several prognostic scoring systems have been devised to predict mortality and to identify who will require early liver transplant these include kings college hospital criteria meld score apache ii and clichy criteria to date no universally accepted nomenclature has been adopted trey and davidson introduced the phrase fulminant hepatic failure in 1970 which they described as a potentially reversible condition the consequence of severe liver injury with an onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks of the appearance of the first symptoms and in the absence of preexisting liver disease  later it was suggested that the term fulminant should be confined to patients who develop jaundice to encephalopathy within 2 weeks phrases subfulminant hepatic failure and late onset hepatic failure were coined for onset between 2 weeks to 3 months and for 8 weeks to 24 weeks respectively   the umbrella phrase of acute liver failure was proposed by kings college group which has been adopted in this article paradoxically in this classification the best prognosis is in the hyperacute group

V cardiorenal syndrome crs is an umbrella term used in the medical field that defines disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other  the heart and the kidneys are involved in maintaining hemodynamic stability and organ perfusion through an intricate network these two organs communicate with one another through a variety of pathways in an interdependent relationship in a 2004 report from national heart lung and blood institute crs was defined as a condition where treatment of congestive heart failure is limited by decline in kidney function  this definition has since been challenged repeatedly but there still remains little consensus over a universally accepted definition for crs at a consensus conference of the acute dialysis quality initiative adqi the crs was classified into five subtypes primarily based upon the organ that initiated the insult as well as the acuity of disease    ronco et al first proposed a fivepart classification system for crs in 2008 which was also accepted at adqi consensus conference in 2010  these include the distinction between crs type 2 and crs type 4 is based on the assumption that also in advanced and chronic disease two different pathophysiological mechanisms can be distinguished whereas both ckd and hf often develop due to a common pathophysiological background most notably hypertension and diabetes mellitus furthermore the feasibility of the distinction between crs type 2 and 4 in terms of diagnosis can be questioned braam et al argue that classifying the crs based on the order in which the organs are affected and the timeframe acute vs chronic is too simplistic and without a mechanistic classification it is difficult to study crs  they view the cardiorenal syndrome in a more holistic integrative manner   they defined the cardiorenal syndrome as a pathophysiological condition in which combined heart and kidney dysfunction amplifies progression of failure of the individual organ by inducing similar pathophysiological mechanisms therefore regardless of which organ fails first the same neurohormonal systems are activated causing accelerated cardiovascular disease and progression of damage and failure of both organs these systems are broken down into two broad categories of hemodynamic factors and nonhemodynamic factors or cardiorenal connectors  the following risk factors have been associated with increased incidence of crs  the pathophysiology of crs can be attributed to two broad categories of hemodynamic factors such as low cardiac output elevation of both intraabdominal and central venous pressures and nonhemodynamic factors or cardiorenal connectors such as neurohormonal and inflammatory activation  it was previously believed that low cardiac output in heart failure patients result in decreased blood flow to the kidneys which can lead to progressive deterioration of kidney function as a result diuresis of these patients will result in hypovolemia and prerenal azotemia however several studies did not find an association between kidney dysfunction and cardiac output or other hemodynamic parameters  in addition crs has been observed in patients with diastolic dysfunction who have normal left ventricular systolic function  therefore there must be additional mechanisms involved in the progression of crs elevated intraabdominal pressures resulting from ascites and abdominal wall edema may be associated with worsening kidney functions in heart failure patients several studies have shown that as a result of this increased intraabdominal pressure there is increased central venous pressure and congestion of the kidneys veins which can lead to worsening kidney function  in addition many neurohormonal and inflammatory agents are implicated in the progression of crs these include increased formation of reactive oxygen species endothelin arginine vasopressin and excessive sympathetic activity which can result in myocardial hypertrophy and necrosis  other cardiorenal connectors include reninangiotensinsystem activation nitric oxidereactive oxygen species imbalance inflammatory factors and abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system which can cause structural and functional abnormalities in both heart andor the kidney there is a close interaction within these cardiorenal connectors as well as between these factors and the hemodynamic factors which makes the study of crs pathophysiology complicated  it is critical to diagnose crs at an early stage in order to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy however unlike markers of heart damage or stress such as troponin creatine kinase natriuretic peptides reliable markers for acute kidney injury are lacking recently research has found several biomarkers that can be used for early detection of acute kidney injury before serious loss of organ function may occur several of these biomarkers include neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin ngal nacetylbdglucosaminidase nag cystatin c and kidney injury molecule1 kim1 which have been shown to be involved in tubular damage  other biomarkers that have been shown to be useful include bnp il18 and fatty acid binding protein fabp  however there is great variability in the measurement of these biomarkers and their use in diagnosing crs must be assessed medical management of patients with crs is often challenging as focus on treatment of one organ may have worsening outcome on the other it is known that many of the medications used to treat hf may worsen kidney function in addition many trials on hf excluded patients with advanced kidney dysfunction therefore our understanding of crs management is still limited to this date diuretics acei arb renin inhibitors aldosterone inhibitors natriuretic peptides vasopressin antagonists adenosine antagonists ultrafiltration inotropes kidney failure is very common in patients suffering from congestive heart failure it was shown that kidney failure complicates onethird of all admissions for heart failure which is the leading cause of hospitalization in the united states among adults over 65 years old  these complications led to longer hospital stay higher mortality and greater chance for readmission another study found that 39 of patients in nyha class 4 and 31 of patients in nyha class 3 had severely impaired kidney function  similarly kidney failure can have deleterious effects on cardiovascular function it was estimated that about 44 of deaths in patients with endstage kidney failure eskf are due to cardiovascular disease  in 2011 karger publishers launched the international peerreviewed medical journal cardiorenal medicine cardiorenal medicine is the official journal of the cardio renal society of america

V boobquake which took place on april 26 2010 was devised by jennifer mccreight a blogger who was then a senior in the purdue university college of science in response to news reports that irans hojatoleslam kazem seddiqi had blamed women who dress immodestly for causing earthquakes on april 19 it was reported that seddiqi advised his listeners that many women who do not dress modestly lead young men astray corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society which increases earthquakes and iranians should adapt their lives to islams moral codes to avoid being buried under the rubble  the day that seddiqis comments were reported mccreight encouraged her blogs readers to help her poke fun at seddiqi by dressing in your immodest clothing to represent boobquake an invitation then extended to the world via facebook  she described boobquake as a scientific experiment with the power of our scandalous bodies combined we should surely produce an earthquake if not im sure sedighi can come up with a rational explanation for why the ground didnt rumble  mccreights idea was popularized by prominent blogs and soon caught the attention of the international media the event also drew criticism from people seeing it as objectifying women  following repeated inquiries from the bbc and other news agencies mccreight planned two meetings for participants one in west lafayette indiana and one in washington dc  soon what originated as a humorous exercise in scientific and skeptical thinking  had begun to ignite serious debate regarding the organization of the feminist community   mccreight born november 2 1987 is an atheist skeptic and feminist  since 2010 she has been pursuing a phd in genome sciences at the university of washington  she attributes her activism to reading richard dawkins book the god delusion and attending a relatively religious college  while working on her undergraduate degree she cofounded the society of nontheists at purdue   one year prior to boobquake mccreight had begun keeping a blog in which she described herself as an atheist and a feminist   on april 19 mccreight announced a protest against seddiqis comments on her blog asking for participants to avoid hateful or antimuslim or antiiranian messages  in the week leading up to boobquake mccreight received several emails from thankful skeptics feminists and iranians  an estimated total of 200000 people participated in boobquake on april 26 2010    the socalled epicenter of boobquake was a lighthearted twohour gathering at 100 pm at the purdue bell tower in west lafayette indiana participants attire included pushup bras unbuttoned shirts short dresses as well as other racy costumes and risqué clothing they also held signs with slogans such as cleavage for science amnesty and god hates boobs purdues student newspaper reported that the female participants were outnumbered by male spectators  washington dcs dupont circle was the site of another gathering at noon the washington gathering was attended by a dozen  women and drew the attention of bbc persia  other notable gatherings were reported in new york city  and vancouver  in vancouver it was reported that most attendees at the event were hundreds of men using camera phones to take pictures especially of a small number of women who were topless  some people also supported the event by purchasing official boobquake 2010 tshirts through zazzlecom the proceeds from the shirts went to the red cross to benefit earthquake recovery and to the james randi educational foundation to support critical thinking  that morning at 1059 am 259 am gmt or 1059 pm on april 25 indiana time  10 hours after boobquake indiana 9 hours after the washington dupont circle event a 65magnitude earthquake struck 195 miles off the coast of taitung taiwan at a depth of 62 miles upon hearing of this mccreight said that it alone was not statistically significant but that she would continue to monitor seismic activity for the next 24 hours  other participants mentioned that the earthquake in taiwan occurred early in the morning prior to the official start of the experiment  after april 26 had ended in all time zones mccreight began to conduct rigorous statistical analysis mccreight pointed out that dozens of earthquakes occur daily and that the goal of her analysis was not to see if all seismic activity would cease but to determine whether the number or severity of earthquakes increased during the experiment by compiling data from the usgs website mccreight determined a 95 confidence interval of zero to 148 daily earthquakes during the course of the boobquake event only 47 earthquakes were reported she also calculated that an earthquake of the magnitude of that in taiwan had a 37 chance of occurring on that day mccreight also said that the mean magnitude of seismic activity during the boobquake event was actually slightly below average as a result of this analysis mccreight concluded that the immodest clothing worn during boobquake had no significant effect on earthquake frequency or magnitude although mccreight admitted that there were some flaws with the experimental procedure and that she doubted it would have any impact on seddiqis opinions she believed that the event fulfilled its original intentions of being a humorous exercise in scientific and skeptical thinking  the event drew a favorable response from several expatriate iranian political activists including mina ahadi of the international committee against executions and stoning and maryam namazie of iran solidarity both of whom are members of the council of exmuslims of britain these activists felt that boobquake was a significant act in the defense of womens rights and human dignity they said that many iranian citizens supported boobquake in its opposition to sedighis views which they believe to be representative of the iranian government of the past three decades    kazem sedighi defended his statements in a new sermon on may 14 2010 when asked why there are not more natural disasters in western nations that do not follow his moral codes sedighi answered that god occasionally allows people to continue sinning so that they eventually go to the bottom of hell it was not reported whether or not sedighi specifically mentioned boobquake during this sermon  a feminist critique and response to boobquake was the brainchild of golbarg bashi who created a countermovement known as brainquake in april 2010  bashi a feminist professor of iranian studies at rutgers and some other feminists were critical of boobquakes method of drawing attention to questions about gender in iran which they believed further victimized and objectified women and girls bashi who conceived of the idea stated that boobquake was essentially another white liberal postfeminist spectacle at the expense of womens struggles in iran negar mottahedeh a duke university professor managed brainquakes social media activities in 2010 bashi explained the disproportionate interest in boobquake as opposed to major feminist campaigns in iran as such our usual boobcrazed i mean civilized maledominated mass media went potty over this eyeran read as iran or islam related campaign turned it into a major international story and thousands of mostly men joined mccreights boobquake facebook event it was in this context that brainquake began as an iranian counter feminist initiative to save the discourse on womens rights from being used as another spectacle and provide visual reference to iranian womens own century long feminist struggles against sexism planned for the same day as boobquake brainquake was initially a facebook event registered composed and managed by bashi brainquakes facebook event encouraged women to demonstrate their abilities to push for change by showing off their résumés cvs honors prizes and accomplishments in this way bashi and her fellow feminist activists hoped to provide a visual reference to iranian womens own century long feminist struggles against sexism  later in spring 2010 brainquakes event page was turned into a fan page and has since become a portal on news and commentary on global womens issues with a particular emphasis on leftist causes brainquake has retained its initial goal of providing a comprehensive visual reference to iranian womens movements and also a pictorial dictionary to many issues and campaigns that identify and fight against all kinds of violence and discrimination against women and girls and other minorities in the united states of america europe and elsewhere these photo albums and the reliable links and information that accompany them are part of brainquakes feminist consciousness raising effort for a mass public russell blackford of the institute for ethics and emerging technologies fully supported the idea of boobquake saying there is nothing wrong with the beauty of the human body male or female nothing wrong with enjoying it and nothing wrong with displaying it to the world blackford encouraged participants to strut your stuff and dont let anyone make you feel ashamed about socalled immodesty feel free to scorn the moralism of islamic clerics and anyone else who tries to put you down  in response to feminists disagreements over boobquake and brainquake some asked why not both melody moezzi for example writing for the blog of ms saw no reason for there to be any conflict between the two events moezzi believed that there should be no problem with having multiple means of discrediting the leaders of

women partly in reaction to the joke in boobquakes name and she has called for a greater respect for feminism and a more welcoming culture in the atheism movement

V toplessness refers to the state in which a females torso is exposed above her waist or hips or with at least her breasts areola and nipples being exposed especially in a public place or in a visual medium in the past some cultures social conventions have required females to cover their torso especially the breasts midriff and navel while exposed breasts were and are normal in many indigenous societies most first world cultures today have formal or informal dress codes legal statutes or religious teachings that require females to cover their breasts in public from adolescence onward contemporary western cultures permit displays of cleavage in appropriate social contexts but exposing the areola and nipples is usually regarded as immodest and is sometimes prosecuted as indecent exposure lewd or even disorderly conduct the topfreedom movement challenges laws that forbid females to go topless in places where males are permitted to be barechested arguing that such restrictions amount to gender discrimination toplessness is less controversial in the fields of entertainment fashion and the arts than it is in society as a whole especially when it is perceived to have artistic merit from early prehistoric art to the present day women have been depicted topless in visual media from painting and sculpture to film and photography in contemporary mainstream cinema academy awardwinning actresses such as halle berry kate winslet and nicole kidman have appeared topless in their films cabaret and burlesque shows as well as haute couture fashion shows and pictorials frequently include toplessness or seethrough clothing societies tend to react more harshly when women expose their breasts in public if the intent is sexual arousal toplessness in adult entertainment such as in strip clubs or in softcore pornography is regarded by some as indecent and is subject to more stringent government regulation or prohibitions public toplessness may occasionally be considered acceptable depending on location and context many jurisdictions legally protect womens right to breastfeed in public or exempt breastfeeding from public indecency laws in many parts of europe and australia as well as at many resort destinations around the world it has become culturally and often legally acceptable for women to sunbathe topless on beaches topless sunbathing may also be permitted in nonbeach areas such as some european parks and lakes designated areas on some cruise ships and swimming pools at some hotels   the word topless usually refers to a woman who is naked above her waist or hips or at least whose breasts are exposed to public view specifically including her areola and nipples it can describe a woman who appears poses or performs with at least her breasts exposed such as a topless model or topless dancer or to an activity undertaken while not wearing a top such as topless sunbathing it may indicate a designated location where one might expect to find women not wearing tops such as a topless beach or topless bar it can also be used to describe a garment that is specifically designed to reveal the breasts such as the topless swimsuit also known as the monokini designed by rudi gernreich in the 1960s  the word topless may carry sexual or exhibitionist connotations because of this advocates of womens legal right to uncover their breasts wherever men may go barechested have adopted the alternative term topfree which is not perceived to have these connotations  attitudes towards toplessness have varied considerably across cultures and over time the lack of clothing above the waist for both females and males was the norm in traditional cultures of north america africa australia and the pacific islands until the arrival of christian missionaries  and it continues to be the norm and acceptable in many indigenous cultures today the practice was also the norm in various asian cultures before muslim expansion in the 13th and 14th centuries  upperclass women had been clothed fully while other women had gone topless in public in many parts of north india including maharashtra and the ganges basin before the muslim conquest of india   malayali people of kerala required women other than brahmins and kshatriya class to strip to waist in public until 1858 when the kingdom of travancore granted all women the right to cover their breasts in public  toplessness was the norm for women in several indigenous peoples of south india including the tamils along the coromandel coast tiyan and other peoples on the malabar coast kadar of cochin island toda nayar cheruman pulayar kuruba koraga nicobarese and the uriya until the 19th century or early 20th century  in thailand the government of field marshal plaek pibulsonggram issued a series of cultural standards between 1939 and 1942 mandate 10 issued on 8 september 1941 instructed thai people to not appear in public places without being appropriately dressed inappropriate dress included wearing no shirt or wearing a wraparound cloth   before the westernization of dress thai women were depicted both fully clothed and topless in public until the early 20th century women from northern thailand wore a long tubeskirt phasin tied high above their waist and below their breasts which were uncovered  in the late 19th century the influence of missionaries and modernization under king chulalongkorn encouraged local women to cover their breasts with blouses  in laos henri mouhot took a picture in 1858 of laotian women depicting virgins with clothed breasts and married women who revealed whole breasts in public because the breast functioning as breastfeeding was considered to be desexed  in the indonesian region toplessness was the norm among the dayak javanese and the balinese people of indonesia before the introduction of islam and contact with western cultures in javanese and balinese societies women had gone topless to work or rest comfortably among the dayak only big breasted women or married women with sagging breasts covered their breasts because their breasts interfered with their work   in most middle eastern countries toplessness has not been socially accepted since at least the early beginning of islam 7th century because of islamic standards for female modesty however toplessness was the norm in earlier cultures within arabia egypt assyria and mesopotamia tunisia and egypt are an exception among arabic states allowing foreign tourists to swim topless on private beaches  among himba women of northern namibia and hamar women of southern ethiopia besides other traditional groups in africa the social norm is for women to be barebreasted female toplessness can also constitute an important aspect of indigenous cultural celebrations for example in the annual reed dance festival mature girls between the ages of 16 and 20 dance topless before the zulu king  however this can lead to crosscultural and legal conflict in 2004 australian police banned members of the papunya community from using a public park in the city of alice springs to practice a traditional aboriginal dance that included topless women  in the south pacific toplessness was common prior to contact with western missionaries but is less common today on the french territory of moorea toplessness is common  in the marshall islands women were traditionally topless before contact with western missionaries and still do not sexually objectify female breasts as is common in much of western society  which the bikini does cover marshall island women swim in their muumuus which are made of a fine polyester that dries quickly  wearing a bikini in the marshall islands is mainly limited to restrictedaccess beaches and pools like those at private resorts or on united states government facilities on the kwajalein atoll within the ronald reagan ballistic missile defense test site   in much of contemporary western society it is not culturally acceptable for women to expose their nipples and areola in public in most western societies once girls enter adolescence it is the social norm for them to behave modestly and cover their breasts in public until recent times women who went topless were cited for indecent exposure or lewd while neither women nor the law in most western countries generally regard breasts as indecent most women are reluctant to go against the social norm of wearing a top in public the strictness of the etiquette varies depending on the social context for example at specific cultural events the norm may be relaxed such as at the mardi gras in new orleans and carnaval in rio de janeiro the same may also apply at a designated topless beach in many european societies between the renaissance and the 19th century exposed breasts were acceptable while a womans bared legs ankles or shoulders were considered risqué  during the renaissance many artists were strongly influenced by classical greek styles and culture  and images of nude and seminude subjects in many forms proliferated in art sculpture and architecture of the period  in aristocratic and upperclass circles the display of breasts also invoked associations with classical greek nude sculptures and art and a classic breast shape was at times regarded as a status symbol as a sign of beauty wealth or social position to maintain youthfullooking bosoms women could employ wet nurses to breastfeed their children  breastbaring female fashions have been traced to 15thcentury courtesan agnès sorel mistress to charles vii of france whose gowns in the french court sometimes exposed one or both of her breasts jean fouquets portrayal of the virgin mary with her left breast uncovered is believed to have taken sorel as a model aristocratic women sought to immortalise their breasts in paint as in the case of simonetta vespucci whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by piero di cosimo in c1480 during the 16th century womens fashions displaying their breasts were common in society from queens to common prostitutes and emulated by all classes  similar fashions became popular in england during the 17th century when they were worn by queen mary ii and by henrietta maria wife of charles i of england for whom architect inigo jones designed a masque costume that fully revealed both of her breasts  in a survey of 190 different societies researches found very few associated exposed breasts with sexuality but there was an insistence that women conceal their breasts  different standards apply to art with one example being the dome of the united states capitol featuring an 1865 fresco depicting goddesses with their breasts exposed  although some social attitudes began to soften during the late 1960s contemporary western societies still generally view toplessness unfavorably during a short period in 1964 topless dress designs appeared at fashion shows but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges  however toplessness has come to be a feature in contemporary haute couture fashion shows a wideranging review of 190 different societies during 1951 found that few insisted that women conceal their breasts in europe topless swimming and sunbathing on public beaches has become socially acceptable in 199495 australian researchers asked 118 collegeage students to rate the behavior of women who go topless on an 8point scale ranging from women should have the same right to topless as men to topless women are exhibitionists they found that 88 of australian university students of either gender considered it acceptable for women to go topless on public beaches although they felt that women exposing their breasts in other contexts such as public parks was inappropriate   they did not find a correlation between exposed breasts and sexuality in social situations a more recent study of 116 collegeage women in australia found that those who had gone topless were more accepting of toplessness generally more sexual and had higher selfesteem and higher body image  in contemporary society the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context womens swimsuits and bikinis commonly reveal the tops and sides of the breasts displaying cleavage is considered permissible in many settings and is even a sign of elegance and sophistication on many formal social occasions but it may be prohibited by dress codes in settings such as workplaces and schools where sexualized displays of the female breast may be considered inappropriate showing the nipples or areola is almost always considered partial nudity and sexually appealing  women and girls may consider toplessness acceptable in gender segregated areas such as changing rooms and dormitories and toplessness may be permitted in mixed bathing situations such as a designated topless beach see below but exposing female nipples and areola is mostly confined to occasional acts of exhibitionism or protest  in a number of cultures including europe and other westernized countries outside the united states there are fewer social restrictions against sunbathing or swimming topless  an online poll found that 99 of germans and 93 of britons were accepting of toplessness on a beach compared to 92 of swedes 91 of italians and 67 of russians  in canada a poll in 1992 found that 38 favored general female public toplessness following that survey several legal rulings in canadian courts from 1996 to 2000 made public toplessness legal but very few women take advantage of the rulings  some cultures have even begun to expand social prohibitions on female toplessness to prepubescent and even infant girls this trend toward covering the female nipple from infancy onward is particularly noticeable in the united states eastern asia and the middle east but is much less common in europe  around the world it is common for women to breastfeed in public  in the united states during the 1990s and later there were a number of legal incidents where women were harassed or cited for exposing their breasts while breastfeeding in public a public backlash spurred legislators in some jurisdictions to specifically legalize public breastfeeding the federal government passed a law in 1999 that specifically provides that a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a federal building or on federal property if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location  some women have engaged in acts of lactivism or acts of politically motivated public breastfeeding to assert these rights  in many indigenous nonwestern cultures it is generally acceptable for both men and women to go without clothing that covers the torso female toplessness can also be a traditional aspect in indigenous cultural celebrations however this can lead to crosscultural and legal conflict during 2004 australian police banned female members of the papunya community from using a public park in the city of alice springs to practice a traditional aboriginal dance while topless  many societies consider women who expose their nipples and areola as immodest and contrary to social norms most jurisdictions do not have laws prohibiting toplessness directly but in many jurisdictions a topless woman may be socially or officially harassed or cited for public lewdness indecent exposure public indecency or disorderly conduct  enforcement of such standards is subject to community standards which are subject to change over time most prosecutions commence with a complaint being made to the police by a member of the public and a judge would be required to adjudicate as to the indecency etc of the exposure the topfreedom movement has claimed success in a few instances in persuading federal courts in the united states to overturn some state laws on the basis of sex discrimination arguing that a woman should be free to expose her chest in any context in which a man can expose his in march 2008 after a yearlong campaign by a pressure group the topless front copenhagens culture and leisure committee concluded that there were no regulations against topless bathing by women in public swimbaths thus no reason to specifically allow it  also in 2008 the city council in vancouver british columbia location of the world naked bike ride gave women the right to go topless in public not solely at swimming pools and beaches  in 2009 members of the swedish feminist organization bara bröst just breast or bare breast went topless at the city pools in malmö sweden this triggered a vote by the citys sports and recreation committee which backed away from requiring women to wear a top only stipulating that everyone must wear a swimsuit their ruling allows women in sweden to swim topless in malmös public swimming pools   we dont decide what men should do with their torso why then do women have to listen to the men moreover many men have larger breasts than women the committee chair said  while an exposed breast in public can have many associated connotations some women in america today argue the exposed breast is a symbol of liberation they speak against the proposed notion that their rightful place was below their male counterparts throughout the late 20th century more and more women began to link the struggle for female equality and the repossession of the female body this can be especially seen in the work of second wave feminists beginning in the early 1960s  the reaction to exposed breast as a symbol of liberation was twosided women who took part in the movement expressed their desire to turn attention away from the excessive eroticization of the female body in american popular culture to more essential societal needs  opposition to the braless movement ironically viewed it as an attack to american morals and public decency the bralessness movement evolved into a barebreasted movement which became another way for women to thumb ones nose at society  while some women exposed their breasts individually there was also an upsurge in topless demonstrations used to gather public attention for womens issues such as pornography and sexism  the sexualization of the breast is unique to only a few western nations and this many women argue causes women to turn to plastic surgery and view their breasts as determinants of beauty rather than potentially nourishing life forces  because of this women are able to liberate their breasts as a way to gain attention make political statements and combat breast exposure laws reinforcement of the supposed uncontrollable seductive nature of womens breasts  the new york radical women led by former tv child star robin morgan carol hanisch  shulamith firestone  and pam allen organized a protest at the 1968 miss america pageant they symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a freedom trash can these included mops pots and pans copies of cosmopolitan and playboy magazines  false eyelashes highheeled shoes curlers hairspray makeup girdles corsets and bras  items the protesters called instruments of female torture  and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity because toplessness often generates media coverage some female political demonstrators have deliberately exposed their breasts in public to draw attention to their cause for example in january 2012 the ukrainian protest group femen attracted worldwide media attention after some members staged a topless protest at the world economic forum in davos  gotoplessorg a us organization claims that women have the same constitutional right to be bare chested in public places as men they further claim constitutional equality between men and women on being topless in public they have successfully joined in legal challenges that have resulted in laws permitting women to expose their breasts just as men do in new york state and in ontario canada in 2009 they used 26 august womens equality day as a day of national protest  toplessness in a public place is most commonly practised or encountered near water either as part of a swimming activity or sunbathing the introduction of the bikini in 1946 and increasingly common glamour shots of popular actresses and models on either side of the atlantic wearing the minimal swimsuit design played a large part in bringing the bikini and sunbathing into the mainstream   in 1964 fashion designer rudi gernreich went further and designed and produced a topless swimsuit which he called the monokini in the united states  the design was first printed by look magazine  gernreichs monokini consisting of only a brief closefitting bottom  was the first womens topless swimsuit  his revolutionary and controversial design included a bottom that extended from the midriff to the upper thigh  and was held up by shoestring laces that make a halter around the neck  a photograph of peggy moffitt the famous model for the suit appeared in womens wear daily life and numerous other publications  despite the negative reaction of fashion critics and church officials shoppers purchased about 3000 of his swimsuit design at 24 each that summer though the only woman to wear it to a beach in the united states was arrested  the novelty of the design caught significant attention life writer shana alexander noted in an article about the introduction of the monokini in july 1964 one funny thing about toplessness is that it really doesnt have much to do with breasts breasts of course are not absurd topless swimsuits are lately people keep getting the two things mixed up  the topless swimsuit was not successful in the united states where only one women wore it on a beach  the soviet government called it barbarism and a sign of social decay the new york city police department was strictly instructed to arrest any woman wearing a swimsuit by the commissioner of parks  in chicago a 19yearold female beachgoer was fined us100 for wearing a topless swimsuit on a public beach  copious coverage of the event helped to send the image of exposed breasts across the world womens clubs and the church were particularly active in their condemnation  in italy and spain the catholic church warned against the topless fashion  in france in 1964 roger frey led the prosecution of the use of the monokini describing it as a public offense against the sense of decency punishable according to article 330 of the penal code consequently the police chiefs must employ the services of the police so that the women who wear this bathing suit in public places are prosecuted   at st tropez on the french riviera where toplessness later became the norm the mayor ordered police to ban toplessness and to watch over the beach via helicopter  jeanluc godard a founding mover of french new wave cinema incorporated a shot of a woman in a topless swimsuit on the riviera into his film a married woman but it was edited out by the censors  a number of caribbean locations especially those that were formerly french and dutch colonies permit nude and topless sunbathing like the french west indies islands of st barths guadeloupe martinique and st maarten  topless sunbathing slowly spread to other western countries throughout europe and australia many of which now allow topless sunbathing on some or all of their beaches either through legal statute or by generally accepted practice and beaches were designated for nude or topless bathers a topless or topoptional beach differs from a nude beach in that beach goers of both sexes are required to keep their genital area covered although females have the option to remove their tops without fearing legal prosecution or official harassment  however media reports in recent years note that the number of women sunbathing topless on french beaches has markedly declined and that younger french women have become more disapproving of exposing breasts in public  even in some parts of europe generally considered to have a liberal attitude towards toplessness such as sweden surveys show there is considerable resistance to its acceptance  the french have traditionally been relaxed with nudity and toplessness in entertainment and dancers and actresses performed topless during the 1910s and beyond in musical theater and cinema toplessness in entertainment has survived to this day at the folies bergère and the moulin rouge some female groups have also performed topless such as the female group the ladybirds which performed topless in the 1960s  women are also at times employed in adultonly venues to perform or pose topless in forms of commercial erotic entertainment such venues can range from downmarket strip clubs and topless bars to upmarket cabarets such as the moulin rouge topless entertainment may also include competitions such as wet tshirt contests in which women display their breasts through translucent wet fabricand may end up removing their tshirts in front of the audience  female toplessness has also become somewhat common during mardi gras in new orleans  during which women flash briefly expose their breasts in return for strings of plastic beads  and at carnaval in rio de janeiro where floats occasionally feature topless women  pasties are sometimes worn by erotic dancers or burlesque entertainers to given the impression of toplessness while avoiding prosecution under local public indecency laws which prohibit exposure of the nipple and areola to stay within the law liquid latex pasties may be used  pasties may be worn by neoburlesque performers and are also found in night clubs fetish parties and parades such as pride parades in many western cultures today images of topless women are regularly featured in magazines calendars and other print media in the united kingdom following a tradition established by the british newspaper the sun in 1970 several mainstream tabloid newspapers feature topless female models on their third page known as page 3 girls although images of topless women are increasingly prevalent in western magazines and film images of topless girls under the age of eighteen years are controversial and are potentially considered child pornography in some jurisdictions  photographers such as jock sturges and bill henson whose work regularly depicts topless and naked adolescent girls have been prosecuted or been embroiled in controversy because of these images  even insinuated toplessness by minors can cause controversy in the 1920s toplessness was featured in some hollywood silent films as well as on the stage though not without objections from various groups and several jurisdictions in the united states set up film censorship boards to censor films in the 1930s the hays code brought an end to nudity in all its forms including toplessness in hollywood films social and official attitudes to toplessness and nudity have eased since those days and the code came under repeated challenge in the 1950s and 60s and had to be abandoned  for example historical epic film hawaii 1966 featured scenes of topless native girls women now appear topless in mainstream cinema although usually somewhat briefly a notable exception was rapanui 1994 which featured repeated scenes of barebreasted native women film critic roger ebert said the producers got away with ongoing toplessness because of the womens brown skin rapa nui slips through the national geographic loophole this is the hollywood convention which teaches us that brown breasts are not as sinful as white ones and so while it may be evil to gaze upon a blond playboy centerfold and feel lust in our hearts it is educational to watch polynesian maidens frolicking topless in the surf this isnt sex its geography  it has become increasingly common for actresses to appear topless in movies actresses who have appeared topless include jane fonda coming home 1978 julie andrews sob 1981 kate winslet titanic 1997 gwyneth paltrow shakespeare in love 1998 reese witherspoon twilight 1998 rene russo the thomas crown affair 1999 katie holmes the gift 2000 and halle berry swordfish 2001 many more have appeared nude in an interview in march 2007 halle berry said that her toplessness in swordfish was gratuitous to the movie but that she needed to do the scene to get over her fear of nudity and that it was the best thing she did for her career having overcome her inhibitions she went on to a role in monsters ball which included a nude scene and which won her an oscar for best actress  some actresses prefer not to expose their breasts and use a body double   pasties were and may still be worn by some actresses while filming an otherwise apparently topless or nude scene which is not caught by the camera angle on june 12 1964 the san francisco chronicle featured a woman wearing a monokini with her exposed breasts on its first page  two weeks later on june 22 1964 the public relations manager of the condor nightclub in san franciscos north beach district gave former prune picker file clerk and waitress carol doda gernreichs monokini to wear for her act her debut as a topless dancer was featured in playboy magazine in april 1965 doda was the first modern topless dancer in the united states   renewing the burlesque era of the early 20th century in the us san francisco mayor john shelley said topless is at the bottom of porn  within a few days women were baring their breasts in many of the clubs lining san franciscos broadway st ushering in the era of the topless bar  san francisco public officials tolerated the topless bars until april 22 1965 when the san francisco police department arrested doda on indecency charges hundreds of protesters gathered outside the police department calling for release of both doda and free speech activist mario savio held in the same station  doda rapidly became a symbol of sexual freedom while topless restaurants shoeshine parlors icecream stands and girl bands proliferated in san francisco and elsewhere journalist earl wilson wrote in his syndicated column are we ready for girls in topless gowns heck we may not even notice them english designers created topless evening gowns inspired by the idea  the san francisco examiner published a real estate advertisement that promised bare top swimsuits are possible here  the artifacts in the ancient siam openair museum near bangkok depict thai women topless the ramakien mural representing the epic lives of the thai people found at the wat phra kaew temple depict women wearing only a skirt in public  as a result of the renaissance in many european societies artists were strongly influenced by classical greek styles and culture  as a result images of nude and seminude subjects in many forms proliferated in art and sculpture  during the victorian era french orientalist painters such as jeanléon gérôme presented an idealized depiction of female toplessness in muslim harem baths  while eugène delacroix a french romantic artist invoked images of liberty as a topless woman portrait of simonetta vespuccic1480by piero di cosimo wild women with unicornc 15001510 portrait of a womanby bartolomeo venetotraditionally assumed to be lucrezia borgia liberty leading the people1830by eugène delacroix blonde woman with bare breastsc1878by édouard manet diana the huntressby gaston casimir saintpierre harem poolby jeanléon gérôme portrait of a gipsy maiden1870by carol szathmari in european prehistoric societies sculptures of female figures with pronounced or highly exaggerated breasts were common a typical example is the socalled venus of willendorf one of many paleolithic venus figurines with ample hips and bosom artifacts such as bowls rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15000 bc up to late antiquity all across europe north africa and the middle east many female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk figures of the phoenician goddess astarte were represented as pillars studded with breasts isis an egyptian goddess who represented among many other things ideal motherhood was often portrayed as suckling pharaohs thereby confirming their divine status as rulers even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breastlike appendices such as the river god hapy who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the nile female breasts were also prominent in the minoan civilization in the form of the famous snake goddess statuettes  in ancient greece there were several cults worshiping the kourotrophos the suckling mother represented by goddesses such as gaia hera and artemis the worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in greece became less common during the first millennium the popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the greek city states a legacy which was passed on to the later roman empire  during the middle of the first millennium bc greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down including female goddesses like athena the patron of athens who represented heroic endeavor there were exceptions aphrodite the goddess of love was more frequently portrayed fully nude though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty a portrayal that has been compared to modern pinups by historian marilyn yalom  although nude men were depicted standing upright most depictions of female nudity in greek art occurred usually with drapery near at hand and with a forwardbending selfprotecting posture  a popular legend at the time was of the amazons a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors the legend was a popular motif in art during greek and roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale

V poland syndrome also polands syndrome polands syndactyly poland sequence  and polands anomaly is a rare birth defect characterized by underdevelopment or absence of the chest muscle pectoralis on one side of the body and usually also webbing of the fingers cutaneous syndactyly of the hand on the same side the ipsilateral hand in most affected individuals the missing part is the large section of the muscle that normally attaches to the upper arm on one side and the breastbone sternum on the other other abnormalities may occur on the affected side of the torso in some cases additional muscles in the chest wall side and shoulder are missing or underdeveloped there may also be rib cage abnormalities such as shortened ribs and the ribs may be noticeable due to less fat under the skin subcutaneous fat breast and nipple abnormalities may also occur and underarm axillary hair is sometimes sparse or abnormally placed in most cases the abnormalities in the chest area do not cause health problems or affect movement  poland syndrome most often affects the right side of the body and occurs more often in males than in females it is usually considered a unilateral condition some have claimed that the term can be applied in bilateral presentation  but others recommend using alternate terminology in those cases    it was first named in 1962 by patrick clarkson a new zealandborn british plastic surgeon working at guys hospital and queen marys hospital london he noticed that three of his patients had both a hand deformity and an underdeveloped breast on the same side he discussed this with his colleague at guys hospital dr philip evans who agreed that the syndrome was not widely appreciated clarkson found a reference to a similar deformity published by alfred poland over a hundred years earlier in guys hospital reports in 1841  clarkson was able to find the hand specimen dissected by poland which was still held in the hospital pathology museum poland had dissected a convict called george elt who was said to be unable to draw his hand across his chest poland noted the chest wall deformity and this was illustrated in his article the hand was also dissected and preserved for posterity in guys hospital museum where it remains today it cannot be truly said that poland described this syndrome because he only described one isolated case clarkson published his series of three cases and named the syndrome after poland in his article  according to the national human genome research institute poland syndrome affects males three times as often as females and affects the right side of the body twice as often as the left  the incidence is estimated to range from one in 7000 to one in 100000 live births  the cause of poland syndrome is unknown however an interruption of the embryonic blood supply to the arteries that lie under the collarbone subclavian arteries at about the 46th day of embryonic development is the prevailing theory  the subclavian arteries normally supply blood to embryonic tissues that give rise to the chest wall and hand variations in the site and extent of the disruption may explain the range of signs and symptoms that occur in poland syndrome abnormality of an embryonic structure called the apical ectodermal ridge which helps direct early limb development may also be involved in this disorder rare cases of poland syndrome are thought to be caused by a genetic change that can be passed down in families but no related genes have been identified  british tv presenter jeremy beadle 19482008 was known for having this condition his poland syndrome manifested itself in the form of his disproportionately small right hand  olympic boxer jérôme thomas is also affected by poland syndrome as his left arm and hand are significantly shorter and smaller than his right thomas also lacks a left pectoral muscle pga tour golfer bryce molder has poland syndrome with an absent left pectoral muscle and a small left hand several surgeries in his childhood repaired syndactly on the left hand  researchers from the department of rehabilitation medicine at the yonsei university college of medicine in seoul korea reported a case of congenital absence of pectoralis major in 1990 according to kakulas and adams pectoralis major is the most frequently congenitally absent muscle the case involved a 22yearold marine who had asymmetrical configuration of chest wall who had never experienced difficulties performing daily activities but who experienced difficulties in the military camp he had difficulty in some training activities especially those such as throwing a grenade or rope climbing very frequent signs frequent signs occasional signs

V capsular contracture is a response of the immune system to foreign materials in the human body medically it occurs mostly in context of the complications from breast implants and artificial joint prosthetics the occurrence of capsular contraction follows the formation of capsules of tightlywoven collagen fibers created by the immune response to the presence of foreign objects surgically installed to the human body eg breast implants artificial pacemakers orthopedic prostheses biological protection by isolation and toleration capsular contracture occurs when the collagenfiber capsule tightens and squeezes the breast implant as such it is a medical complication that can be very painful and discomforting and might distort the aesthetics of the breast implant and the breast although the cause of capsular contracture is unknown factors common to its incidence include bacterial contamination rupture of the breastimplant shell leakage of the siliconegel filling and hematoma moreover because capsular contracture is a consequence of the immune system defending the patients bodily integrity and health it might reoccur even after the requisite corrective surgery for the initial incidence the degree of an incidence of capsular contracture is graded using the fourgrade baker scale the surgical implantation methods that have reduced capsular contracture include submuscular breast implant placement using either textured or polyurethanecoated implants    limited handling of the implants minimal contact with the chest wall skin before their insertions and irrigating the surgical sites with tripleantibiotic solutions   the correction of capsular contracture might require the surgical removal release of the capsule or the removal and possible replacement of the breast implant itself closed capsulotomy disrupting the capsule via external manipulation a oncecommon maneuver for treating hard capsules was discontinued because it might rupture the breast implant nonsurgical methods of treating capsules include massage external ultrasound  treatment with leukotriene pathway inhibitors eg accolate singulair   and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy  the mentor worldwide llc corporation one of the three us fdaapproved breastimplant device manufacturers conducted a study of the medical complications suffered by breast implantation surgery patients in march 2000 at a food and drug administration presentation the mentor report indicated that 43 per cent of patients with saline breast implants reported medical complications occurring within three years of the surgery moreover 10 per cent of that percentage group complained of capsular contracture

V the gastrocolic reflex or gastrocolic response is one of a number of physiological reflexes controlling the motility or peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract it involves an increase in motility of the colon in response to stretch in the stomach and byproducts of digestion in the small intestine thus this reflex is responsible for the urge to defecate following a meal the small intestine also shows a similar motility response the gastrocolic reflex helps make room for more food  the reflex was demonstrated by myoelectric recordings in the colons of animals and humans which showed an increase in electrical activity within as little as 15 minutes after eating the recordings also demonstrated that the gastrocolic reflex is uneven in its distribution throughout the colon the sigmoid colon is more greatly affected than the right side of the colon in terms of a phasic response however the tonic response across the colon is uncertain when pressure within the rectum becomes increased the gastrocolic reflex acts as a stimulus for defecation a number of neuropeptides have been proposed as mediators of the gastrocolic reflex these include serotonin neurotensin cholecystokinin cck and gastrin clinically the gastrocolic reflex has been implicated in pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome the very act of eating or drinking can provoke an overreaction of the gastrocolic response in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome due to their heightened visceral sensitivity and this can lead to abdominal pain diarrhea or constipation  also the serotonin 5ht3 antagonist ondansetron decreases the tonic response to stretch

V the brain is a part of nature in animals of all descriptions and the subject of experimental inquiry the modern period is defined as a time after the beginning of the industrial revolution which is dated at sometime about 1800      locke wrote a treatise on human understanding in which he commented the power of abstracting is not at all in themand that the having of general ideas is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain it the early form of brain in homo sapiens  as it exists in foetal life is precisely similar to the brain in a fish as it exists in its permanent adult state 1828  monsters destitute of brain are frequently born strong and fat several of them live some time after birth spurzheim 1825  the fish was stated to hardly possess a brain by darwin 1872  in discussing the belief that fish contains certain elements which are adapted in a special manner to renovate the brain and so to support mental labour a prominent physiologist says  there is no foundation whatever for this view 1898  a rotary swing which causes vertigo and nausea was proposed by darwin as a theoretical treatment for insanity 1833   practitioners who have put the proposal to the test of experiment have if we are not mistaken in most instances been convinced of its utility among these may be mentioned dr wake of york the brain of a tortoise is extremely small in an experiment involving removing the brain of a landtortoise the tortoise carried on to live six months freshwater tortoises when subject to the same experiment continued but did not live so long when the head of a tortoise was cut off a tortoise entirely it lived for 23 days 1831    according to rudolphi the brain of a full grown greenland whale balena mysticetus seventyfive feet long weighs only 5lbs 10oz 4drs 1843  in the same publication of 1843 metcalfe states we have no accurate information on the weight of the brain of a sperm whale which measures eightyfour feet in length cruviellhier sic took a male frog when in coïtu and removed its head the frog continued in the act in respect to muscular motion seemed to progress nearly as well as prior to being deprived of its head 1849  the nature of the substance of the brain and nerves has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained 1819  mflourins performed experiments on these and his findings were published in italy 1819 republished in france 1822  phrenology certainly admits of proof or disproof and would obtain it if the measurements of a sufficient number heads and those belonging to persons of marked qualities of mind could be accurately and indisputably known rolando discovered the course of these drs gall and spurzheim had given an explanation of this already 1835  the works of froriep bischoff ackermann walter professor at berlin walther professor at bonne bl\u0276de muller meyer of naples démongeon all appeared before 1807 on the fourteenth of may 1808 the institute of france was presented with a memoir containing anatomical discoveries 1835  from the age of galen or perhaps or perhaps from that of herophilus and erasistratus down to the present time the hypothesis has been maintained with little variation that the brain presides over the body through the spinal marrow and the nerves was not discovered by dissection of the brain but by observing the agreement between the disposition of homo sapiens and the lower animals and the forms of their heads the brain was afterwards dissected and its structure examined with great care in the hope it would shed some light on the subject we are indebted to phrenology for all useful knowledge concerning the anatomy of the brain 1857  writersas far back as hippocrates knew all that was necessary to know in a merely physiological point of view of the lungs the liver and the stomach and attributed to them the proper functionthe brain however was a terra incognita  an unexplored and unknown region till the columbus of the mental world the great dr gall added its broad fields to the domains of science when we come to the nervous system including the brain the organ through which mind is manifested we seem to approach the verge of another world through thorough investigation it was discovered that these people had the heaviest brains 1876

V liver failure or hepatic insufficiency is the inability of the liver to perform its normal synthetic and metabolic function as part of normal physiology two forms are recognised acute and chronic  acute liver failure is defined as the rapid development of hepatocellular dysfunction specifically coagulopathy and mental status changes encephalopathy in a patient without known prior liver disease   the diagnosis of acute liver failure is based on physical exam laboratory findings patient history and past medical history to establish mental status changes coagulopathy rapidity of onset and absence of known prior liver disease respectively   the exact definition of rapid is somewhat questionable and different subdivisions exist which are based on the time from onset of first hepatic symptoms to onset of encephalopathy one scheme defines acute hepatic failure as the development of encephalopathy within 26 weeks of the onset of any hepatic symptoms this is subdivided into fulminant hepatic failure which requires onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks and subfulminant which describes onset of encephalopathy after 8 weeks but before 26 weeks  another scheme defines hyperacute as onset within 7 days acute as onset between 7 and 28 days and subacute as onset between 28 days and 24 weeks   chronic liver failure usually occurs in the context of cirrhosis itself potentially the result of many possible causes such as excessive alcohol intake hepatitis b or c autoimmune hereditary and metabolic causes such as iron or copper overload steatohepatitis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease

V crista acustica also siebolds organ or crista acoustica is a part of the hearing organ tibial organ in some insects eg grasshoppers crickets katydids it is a collection of sensory cells that form a crest hence the name on top of the hollow tube the foreleg trachea behind the hearing membrane tympanum on the legs of the insect     the crista acustica is a transition from the intermedia organ from the midline to the periphery together which compose the tibial hearing organ as opposed to the tympanal hearing organ the crista acustica is one of three fiddlestringlike organs or chordotonal organ in insects the others are the intermediate organ and the supratympanal organsubgenual organ these chordotonal organs are actually collections of sensory cells sensitive to vibration these cells are called scolopidia cells their cells are attached to the tube in the legs of the insects the trachae trahkeyah so when the tube vibrates the cells vibrate in the crista acustica it turns out that different scolopidia cells are sensitive to different vibrations depending on the frequency of the vibration since these organs are sensitive to vibrations due to changes in pressure  it turns out the cells closest to midline are the largest and sensitive to the lowest frequency low frequencies having the largest wavelength and the cells further out distal are smaller and sensitive to higher frequencies since high frequencies have shorter wavelengths this orderly arrangement of sensory cells gives the insect the ability to discriminate frequencies much like the inner ear of mammals

V parental experience as well as changing hormone levels during pregnancy and postpartum cause changes in the parental brain  displaying maternal sensitivity towards infant cues processing those cues and being motivated to engage socially with her infant and attend to the infants needs in any context could be described as mothering behavior and is regulated by many systems in the maternal brain  research has shown that hormones such as oxytocin prolactin estradiol and progesterone are essential for the onset and the maintenance of maternal behavior in rats and other mammals as well       mothering behavior has also been classified within the basic drives sexual desire hunger and thirst fear powerdominance etc  less is known about the paternal brain but changes in the fathers brain occur alongside the mother once the offspring is born    different hormone levels in the maternal brain and the overall well being of the mother account for 4050 of differences in the mothers attachment to her infant  mothers experience a decrease in estrogen and an increase in oxytocin and prolactin caused by lactation pregnancy parturition and interaction with the infant  the levels of oxytocin in the maternal brain correlate with maternal behaviors such as gazing vocalization positive affect affectionate touch and other similar motherinfant relationship behaviors  high motherinfant attachment correlates with a higher ratio of estradiolprogesterone at the end of pregnancy than at the beginning  in the first few days after giving birth the levels of cortisol are high which correlates with maternal approach behavior and positive maternal attitudes   mothers with high levels of cortisol were also found to be more vocal towards their children   mothers who experienced adversity in their own childhood had higher daily patterns of cortisol levels and were less maternally sensitive  glucocorticoids are not essential for displaying maternal behaviors but in mothers the levels of glucocorticoids are elevated as to initiate lactation   different areasstructures of the brain are associated with different factors which contribute to maternal behavior ones own infant acts as a special stimulus which triggers activation of different areas of the brain these brain areas together allow for maternal behavior and related systems  the medial preoptic area mpoa of the hypothalamus contains receptors for estradiol progesterone prolactin oxytocin vasopressin and opioids  all these hormones are involved in some way in activating maternal behavior in the brain  the following are other behavioral changes necessary for mothering that the mpoa is responsible for  the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex also contain receptors for the hormones which are most likely to be changing behavior at the time of pregnancy and may be the sites where these changes occur  increased activity has also been observed in the amygdala as the mother is responding to emotions seen in negative fearful faces  positive faces    or familiar faces  that her baby makes primate mothers with damage to the prefrontal cortex have also been associated with disrupted maternal behavior  the dorsolateral prefrontal cortexdlpfc plays a role in the attention cognitive flexibility and working memory of the mother  it helps the mother identify infant cues in any environment and efficiently it allows for the decisionmaking and action planning process involved in attending to the infants cues  the thalamus parietal cortex and brain stem serve for processing the smell touch and vocalization associated with the infant  changes in estrogen oxytocin and prolactin in the early postpartum period cause changes in the structures of the maternal brain  postpartum new neuron production is suppressed due to decreased levels of estrogen and increased levels of glucocorticoids mother rats   motherinfant interaction is also thought to suppress neurogenesis in the hippocampus postpartum in the rat maternal brain    maternal experience increases neurogenesis in the subventricular zone sbz which is responsible for producing the neurons of the olfactory bulb  prolactin is the hormone which mediates the increase in neurogenesis in sbz   in animals structures of the mothers brain change postpartum due to the increased interaction of the mother with the infant  the volume of gray matter increases portpartum in the following brain regions  these changes in the brain may occur in order to promote appropriate mothering behavior  the mothers positive attitude towards the infant can be used as a predictor for the increase in gray matter in the above stated brain structures  also in rats the increased interaction with pups causes an increase in density in the mpoa  postpartum increase in gray matter volumes may help the mother activate the motivation to perform maternal behavior in response to cue from their offspring  postpartum the substantia nigra activates positive responses to the pup stimuli via dopamine neurons  the amygadala prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus begin to change during pregnancy due to the high levels of stress experienced by the mother during this time  in human mothers there was a correlation between increased gray matter volume in the substantia nigra and positive emotional feelings towards the infant   other changes such as menstrual cycle  hydration weight and nutrition   may also be factors which trigger the maternal brain to change during pregnancy and postpartum maternal experience alters behaviors which stem from the hippocampus such as enhancing spatial navigation learning and behaviors linked with anxiety  recent research has begun to look at how maternal psychopathology affects the maternal brain in relation to parenting daniel schechter and colleagues have studied specifically interpersonal violencerelated posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd and comorbid dissociation as associated with specific patterns of maternal neural activation in response to viewing silent videostimuli of stressful parenttoddler interactions such as separation versus lessstressful ones such as play   importantly less medial prefrontal cortex activity and greater limbic system activity ie entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were found among these posttraumatically stressed mothers of toddlers compared to mothers of toddlers without ptsd in response to stressful parentchild interactions as well as within a different sample in response to menacing adult malefemale interactions in the latter study this pattern of corticolimbic dysregulation was linked to less observed maternal sensitivity during motherchild play  decreased ventralmedial prefrontal cortex activity in violenceexposed mothers in response to viewing their own and unfamiliar toddlers in videoclips of separation versus play has also been associated with increased ptsd symptoms parenting stress and decreased methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene  women who had a positive experience involving their family in their childhood are more likely to be more maternally sensitive and provide that same experience for their own children  mothers that had negative experiences involving their families undergo neurobiological changes which lead to high stress reactivity and insecure attachment this causes lower maternal responsiveness to their infants needs   rat mothers provide high levels of maternal care licking and grooming to their offspring if they themselves received high maternal care as a pup from their own mothers   rat mothers who received low levels of maternal care as pups have lower levels of expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene and lower synaptic density in the hippocampus  in human mothers lower hippocampal volume has been associated with a lower ability to regulate emotions and stress which can be linked with decreased maternal sensitivity as a mother    mothers with insecure attachments to their own mothers display higher amygdala sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli like hearing their infant cry  having more difficulty dealing with stress makes mothers less responsive to their infants cues  larger gray matter and increased activations of the following brain areas occur in mothers who had experienced higher quality maternal care as infants  this allows the mother to be more sensitive to her own infants needs  postpartum depression has also been associated with mothers who received low quality maternal care early in their own life  in only 6 of mammalian species including humans the father plays a significant role in caring for his young   similar to the changes that occur in the maternal brain the same areas of the brain amygdala hypothalamus prefrontal cortex olfactory bulb etc are activated in the father and hormonal changes occur in the paternal brain to ensure display of parenting behavior  an increase in levels of oxytocin glucocorticoids estrogen and prolactin occur in the paternal brain   these hormonal changes occur through the fathers interaction with the mother and his offspring  oxytocin levels are positively correlated with the amount of affection the father displays towards the child  in humans and in other primate species lower levels of testosterone have been linked to the display of paternal behavior   in father rats just as in the mother rats a decrease in neurogenesis in the hippocampus occurs postpartum  just like in mothers fathers also have increased levels of glucocorticoids which are thought to suppress the production of new cells in the brain  marmoset fathers have enhanced dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex this increase correlates with increase in vasopressin receptors in this area of the paternal brain with age this effect is reversed and is therefore believed to be driven by fatherinfant interactions   changes in neurogenesis in the prefrontal cortex of the paternal brain have been linked in some species to recognition of kin  being exposed to crying babies activates the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala in both fathers and mothers but not in nonparents   the level of testosterone in the paternal brain correlates with the effectiveness of the dads response to the babys cry  increased levels of prolactin in the paternal brain has also been correlated with a more positive response to the infants cry

V hydrochloric acid is a clear colorless highly pungent solution of hydrogen chloride hcl in water it is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with many industrial uses hydrochloric acid is found naturally in gastric acid it was historically called acidum salis muriatic acid and spirits of salt because it was produced from rock salt and green vitriol by basilius valentinus in the 15th century and later from the chemically similar substances common salt and sulfuric acid by johann rudolph glauber in the 17th century free hydrochloric acid was first formally described in the 16th century by libavius later it was used by chemists such as glauber priestley and davy in their scientific research with major production starting in the industrial revolution hydrochloric acid is used in the chemical industry as a chemical reagent in the largescale production of vinyl chloride for pvc plastic and mditdi for polyurethane it has numerous smallerscale applications including household cleaning production of gelatin and other food additives descaling and leather processing about 20 million tonnes of hydrochloric acid are produced worldwide annually   hydrochloric acid was known to european alchemists as spirits of salt or acidum salis salt acid both names are still used especially in other languages such as german salzsäure dutch zoutzuur swedish saltsyra and polish kwas solny gaseous hcl was called marine acid air the old presystematic name muriatic acid has the same origin muriatic means pertaining to brine or salt and thence muriate means hydrochloride and this name is still sometimes used   the name hydrochloric acid was coined by the french chemist joseph louis gaylussac in 1814  aqua regia a mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid prepared by dissolving sal ammoniac in nitric acid was described in the works of pseudogeber the 13thcentury european alchemist      other references suggest that the first mention of aqua regia is in byzantine manuscripts dating to the end of the thirteenth century     free hydrochloric acid was first formally described in the 16th century by libavius who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles  other authors claim that pure hydrochloric acid was first discovered by the german benedictine monk basil valentine in the 15th century  by heating common salt and green vitriol  whereas others claim that there is no clear reference to the preparation of pure hydrochloric acid until the end of the sixteenth century  in the seventeenth century johann rudolf glauber from karlstadt am main germany used sodium chloride salt and sulfuric acid for the preparation of sodium sulfate in the mannheim process releasing hydrogen chloride gas joseph priestley of leeds england prepared pure hydrogen chloride in 1772  and by 1808 humphry davy of penzance england had proved that the chemical composition included hydrogen and chlorine  during the industrial revolution in europe demand for alkaline substances increased a new industrial process by nicolas leblanc issoundun france enabled cheap largescale production of sodium carbonate soda ash in this leblanc process common salt is converted to soda ash using sulfuric acid limestone and coal releasing hydrogen chloride as a byproduct until the british alkali act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries the excess hcl was vented to air after the passage of the act soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale   in the twentieth century the leblanc process was effectively replaced by the solvay process without a hydrochloric acid byproduct since hydrochloric acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications the commercial interest initiated other production methods some of which are still used today after the year 2000 hydrochloric acid is mostly made by absorbing byproduct hydrogen chloride from industrial organic compounds production    since 1988 hydrochloric acid has been listed as a table ii precursor under the 1988 united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances because of its use in the production of heroin cocaine and methamphetamine  hydrogen chloride hcl is a monoprotic acid which means it can dissociate ie ionize only once to give up one h  ion a single proton in aqueous hydrochloric acid the h  joins a water molecule to form a hydronium ion h3o    the other ion formed is cl  the chloride ion hydrochloric acid can therefore be used to prepare salts called chlorides such as sodium chloride hydrochloric acid is a strong acid since it is essentially completely dissociated in water   monoprotic acids have one acid dissociation constant ka which indicates the level of dissociation in water for a strong acid like hcl the ka is large theoretical attempts to assign a ka to hcl have been made  when chloride salts such as nacl are added to aqueous hcl they have practically no effect on ph indicating that cl  is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that hcl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution for intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid the assumption that h  molarity a unit of concentration equals hcl molarity is excellent agreeing to four significant digits   of the six common strong mineral acids in chemistry hydrochloric acid is the monoprotic acid least likely to undergo an interfering oxidationreduction reaction it is one of the least hazardous strong acids to handle despite its acidity it consists of the nonreactive and nontoxic chloride ion intermediatestrength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage maintaining their concentrations over time these attributes plus the fact that it is available as a pure reagent make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent hydrochloric acid is the preferred acid in titration for determining the amount of bases strong acid titrants give more precise results due to a more distinct endpoint azeotropic or constantboiling hydrochloric acid roughly 202 can be used as a primary standard in quantitative analysis although its exact concentration depends on the atmospheric pressure when it is prepared  hydrochloric acid is frequently used in chemical analysis to prepare digest samples for analysis concentrated hydrochloric acid dissolves many metals and forms oxidized metal chlorides and hydrogen gas it also reacts with basic compounds such as calcium carbonate or copperii oxide forming the dissolved chlorides that can be analyzed   physical properties of hydrochloric acid such as boiling and melting points density and ph depend on the concentration or molarity of hcl in the aqueous solution they range from those of water at very low concentrations approaching 0 hcl to values for fuming hydrochloric acid at over 40 hcl    hydrochloric acid as the binary twocomponent mixture of hcl and h2o has a constantboiling azeotrope at 202 hcl and 1086c 227f there are four constantcrystallization eutectic points for hydrochloric acid between the crystal form of hclh2o 68 hcl hcl2h2o 51 hcl hcl3h2o 41 hcl hcl6h2o 25 hcl and ice 0 hcl there is also a metastable eutectic point at 248 between ice and the hcl3h2o crystallization  hydrochloric acid is prepared by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water hydrogen chloride can be generated in many ways and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist the largescale production of hydrochloric acid is almost always integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals hydrochloric acid is produced in solutions up to 38 hcl concentrated grade higher concentrations up to just over 40 are chemically possible but the evaporation rate is then so high that storage and handling need extra precautions such as pressure and low temperature bulk industrialgrade is therefore 30 to 35 optimized for effective transport and limited product loss by hcl vapors higher concentrations require the material to be pressurized and cooled to reduce evaporation losses in the united states solutions of between 20 and 32 are sold as muriatic acid solutions for household purposes in the us mostly cleaning are typically 10 to 12 with strong recommendations to dilute before use in the united kingdom where it is sold as spirits of salt for domestic cleaning the potency is the same as the us industrial grade  major producers worldwide include dow chemical at 2 million metric tons annually 2mtyear calculated as hcl gas georgia gulf corporation tosoh corporation akzo nobel and tessenderlo at 05 to 15mtyear each total world production for comparison purposes expressed as hcl is estimated at 20mtyear with 3mtyear from direct synthesis and the rest as secondary product from organic and similar syntheses by far most hydrochloric acid is consumed captively by the producer the open world market size is estimated at 5mtyear  hydrochloric acid is a strong inorganic acid that is used in many industrial processes such as refining metal the application often determines the required product quality  one of the most important applications of hydrochloric acid is in the pickling of steel to remove rust or iron oxide scale from iron or steel before subsequent processing such as extrusion rolling galvanizing and other techniques   technical quality hcl at typically 18 concentration is the most commonly used pickling agent for the pickling of carbon steel grades the spent acid has long been reused as ironii chloride also known as ferrous chloride solutions but high heavymetal levels in the pickling liquor have decreased this practice the steel pickling industry has developed hydrochloric acid regeneration processes such as the spray roaster or the fluidized bed hcl regeneration process which allow the recovery of hcl from spent pickling liquor the most common regeneration process is the pyrohydrolysis process applying the following formula  by recuperation of the spent acid a closed acid loop is established  the ironiii oxide byproduct of the regeneration process is valuable used in a variety of secondary industries  another major use of hydrochloric acid is in the production of organic compounds such as vinyl chloride and dichloroethane for pvc this is often captive use consuming locally produced hydrochloric acid that never actually reaches the open market other organic compounds produced with hydrochloric acid include bisphenol a for polycarbonate activated carbon and ascorbic acid as well as numerous pharmaceutical products  numerous products can be produced with hydrochloric acid in normal acidbase reactions resulting in inorganic compounds these include water treatment chemicals such as ironiii chloride and polyaluminium chloride pac both ironiii chloride and pac are used as flocculation and coagulation agents in sewage treatment drinking water production and paper production other inorganic compounds produced with hydrochloric acid include road application salt calcium chloride nickelii chloride for electroplating and zinc chloride for the galvanizing industry and battery production  hydrochloric acid can be used to regulate the acidity ph of solutions in industry demanding purity food pharmaceutical drinking water highquality hydrochloric acid is used to control the ph of process water streams in lessdemanding industry technical quality hydrochloric acid suffices for neutralizing waste streams and swimming pool ph control  highquality hydrochloric acid is used in the regeneration of ion exchange resins cation exchange is widely used to remove ions such as na  and ca  from aqueous solutions producing demineralized water the acid is used to rinse the cations from the resins  na  is replaced with h  and ca  with 2 h  ion exchangers and demineralized water are used in all chemical industries drinking water production and many food industries  hydrochloric acid is used for a large number of smallscale applications such as leather processing purification of common salt household cleaning  and building construction  oil production may be stimulated by injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an oil well dissolving a portion of the rock and creating a largepore structure oil well acidizing is a common process in the north sea oil production industry  hydrochloric acid has been used for dissolving calcium carbonate ie such things as descaling kettles and for cleaning mortar off brickwork but it is a hazardous liquid which must be used with care when used on brickwork the reaction with the mortar only continues until the acid has all been converted producing calcium chloride carbon dioxide and water many chemical reactions involving hydrochloric acid are applied in the production of food food ingredients and food additives typical products include aspartame fructose citric acid lysine hydrolyzed vegetable protein as food enhancer and in gelatin production foodgrade extrapure hydrochloric acid can be applied when needed for the final product   gastric acid is one of the main secretions of the stomach it consists mainly of hydrochloric acid and acidifies the stomach content to a ph of 1 to 2   chloride cl  and hydrogen h  ions are secreted separately in the stomach fundus region at the top of the stomach by parietal cells of the gastric mucosa into a secretory network called canaliculi before it enters the stomach lumen  gastric acid acts as a barrier against microorganisms to prevent infections and is important for the digestion of food its low ph denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin the low ph also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by selfcleavage after leaving the stomach the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium bicarbonate  the stomach itself is protected from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid   concentrated hydrochloric acid fuming hydrochloric acid forms acidic mists both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue with the potential to damage respiratory organs eyes skin and intestines irreversibly upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals such as sodium hypochlorite bleach naclo or potassium permanganate kmno4 the toxic gas chlorine is produced personal protective equipment such as latex gloves protective eye goggles and chemicalresistant clothing and shoes will minimize risks when handling hydrochloric acid the united states environmental protection agency rates and regulates hydrochloric acid as a toxic substance  the un number or dot number is 1789 this number will be displayed on a placard on the container

V the excretory system of gastropods removes nitrogenous waste and maintains the internal water balance of these creatures commonly referred to as snails and slugs the primary organ of excretion is a nephridium   the most primitive gastropods retain two nephridia but in the great majority of species the right nephridium has been lost leaving a single excretory organ located in the anterior part of the visceral mass the nephridium projects into the main venous sinus in the animals foot the circulatory fluid of gastropods known as haemolymph directly bathes the tissues where it supplies them with oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste a necessary waste product of metabolism from the arterial sinuses bathing the tissues it drains into the venous sinus and thus flows past the nephridium the main body cavity of most aquatic gastropods also includes pericardial glands often located above the heart these secrete waste into the haemolymph prior to further filtration in the nephridium pulmonates lack these glands so that the nephridium is the only major organ of excretion in some gastropods the nephridium opens directly into the sinus but more usually there is a small duct referred to as the renopericardial canal in aquatic gastropods the nephridium is drained by a ureter that opens near the rear of the mantle cavity this allows the flow of water through the cavity to flush out the excreta terrestrial pulmonates instead have a much longer ureter that opens near the anus in addition to the pericardial glands and nephridum excretory cells are also present in the digestive glands opening into the stomach these glands have a metabolic function somewhat similar to that of the vertebrate liver and excrete waste products directly into the digestive system where it is voided with the faeces in aquatic gastropods the waste product is invariably ammonia which rapidly dissolves in the surrounding water in the case of freshwater species the nephridium also resorbs a significant amount of salt in order to prevent its loss through osmosis into the surrounding water terrestrial species instead excrete insoluble uric acid which allows them to maintain their internal water balance even so most species require a somewhat humid environment and secrete a considerable amount of water in their slime trail those few species that dwell in arid environments typically hibernate or aestivate during dry periods to preserve moisture barnes robert d 1982 invertebrate zoology philadelphia pa holtsaunders international pp364365 isbn0030567475

V the heslington brain is a 2600yearold human brain found inside a skull buried in a pit in heslington yorkshire in england in 2008 it is the oldest preserved brain ever found in europe or asia and is believed to be the bestpreserved ancient brain in the world  the skull was discovered during an archaeological dig commissioned by the university of york on the site of its new campus on the outskirts of the city of york the area was found to have been the site of welldeveloped permanent habitation between 20003000 years before the present day a number of possibly ritualistic objects were found to have been deposited in several pits including the skull which had belonged to a man probably in his 30s he had been hanged before being decapitated with a knife and his skull appears to have been buried immediately the rest of the body was missing although it is not known why he was killed it is possible that it may have been a human sacrifice or ritual murder the brain was found while the skull was being cleaned it had survived despite the rest of the tissue on the skull having disappeared long ago after being extracted at york hospital the brain was subjected to a range of medical and forensic examinations which found that it was remarkably intact though it had shrunk to only about 20 of its original size it showed few signs of decay though most of its original material had been replaced by an as yet unidentified organic compound due to chemical changes during burial according to the archaeologists and scientists who have examined it the brain has a resilient tofulike texture it is not clear why the heslington brain survived although the presence of a wet anoxic environment underground seems to have been an essential factor and research is still ongoing to shed light on how the local soil conditions may have contributed to its preservation   the site where the brain was discovered is about 3 kilometres 19mi southeast of york city centre on the eastern edge of heslington village it is situated partly on the ridge of an ancient glacial moraine and partly in the basin of the vale of york  until the construction of the heslington east campus of the university of york in 2009 the site was used as agricultural land  survey and excavation work commissioned by the university was carried out on the site from 2003 it culminated in a fullscale excavation carried out in 200708 by york archaeological trust in an area of just over 8 hectares 20 acres  the archaeologists found that the landscape had been inhabited and farmed for thousands of years the remains of prehistoric fields buildings and trackways were discovered dating from the bronze age through to the middle of the iron age   with traces of earlier activity as far back as the mesolithic and neolithic periods  during the iron age the area appears to have been the site of a permanent settlement the excavators found a number of circular features which they interpreted as the remains of roundhouses  the inhabitants seem to have relocated during the roman period to a site further up the ridge leaving the area of the iron age settlement to revert to fields  around a dozen pits were found on the site and possibly ritualistic objects were found in a number of them some pits had been pierced with a single stake while a number of pits included burned cobbles of a local type of stone the headless body of a red deer had been deposited in a drainage channel and a red deer antler was found in an iron age ditch  in one waterlogged pit a human skull  with the jawbone and the first two vertebrae still attached  was discovered in august 2008 lying facedown at the bottom of the pit the find was seen as unusual but its true importance was not discovered until after it had been transported within a block of soil to the finds laboratory of the york archaeological trust as finds officer rachel cubitt was cleaning it she noticed that something was loose inside the skull  she peered through its base and saw that it contained a yellow substance she said later that it jogged my memory of a university lecture on the rare survival of ancient brain tissue we gave the skull special conservation treatment as a result and sought expert medical opinion  the skull and its contents were put into cold storage and were examined using a variety of medical and autopsy techniques  the skull was found to be that of a man aged between 2645 years old at the time of death likely in his mid30s radiocarbon dating found that the man had died some time between the 7th century bce and 5th century bce 673482 bce he belonged to the mitochondrial dna haplogroup j1d which had not previously been seen in britain in either dead living or dead individuals j1d has been identified previously in only a few people from tuscany and the middle east it may have been more widely present in britain in the past and lost through genetic drift  he had died from traumatic spondylolisthesis  a complete fracture of his spine that is usually associated with death by hanging shortly after death his head and upper vertebrae had been severed from his body almost surgically using a thinbladed knife although there is evidence from other sites of trophy heads in iron age societies it appears that the head was immediately deposited in the pit and buried in finegrained wet sediment  the reason for the killing is unclear the archaeological context suggests that the man may have been killed for a ritual or sacrificial purposes  ct scanning was carried out at york hospital where the skull was opened and the contents were removed and forensically examined the interior of the skull was found to contain several large fragments of brain mixed with sediment the brain had shrunk to about 20 of its original size but many anatomical features were still readily identifiable it was remarkably wellpreserved and had few signs of decay other than the presence of a few bacterial spores  one of the fragments clearly showed the neural folds of a cerebral lobe  discovery of such a wellpreserved brain is all the more remarkable considering the fragility of all human brains following death even when placed in a chilled environment in a mortuary brains quickly dissolve into liquid  the high fat content of the brain means that it is usually the first major organ to deteriorate  the brains of the crew of the american civil war submarine hl hunley were recovered along with their skeletonised bodies in 2000 and brains were found in the wreck of the english warship mary rose but archaeologists found that they liquefied within a matter of minutes unless preserved immediately in formalin brains found in terrestrial environments have tended to be better preserved as the surviving material tends to have a higher proportion of hydrophobic waterrepellent matter than in a fresh brain there appear to be a number of routes by which brains have been preserved though a common factor appears to be the existence of a wet anoxic environment  the presence of such an environment is thought to have been responsible for a similar but less complete preservation of brain matter discovered in the 1990s during the construction of a new magistrates court in hull  the preservation of the brain has been attributed to several factors first the waterlogged anoxic soil in which the head was buried even though only the brain and not the rest of the tissue survived burial only scanty traces of other tissue remain on the rest of the skull second the brain had undergone unusual chemical changes as a result of being severed and the conditions under which it was buried in contrast to other brains found no adipocere  a fatty compound formed through the process of decay  was detected in the heslington brain probably because the head was severed from the body before the brain had started to decay there had also been a major decrease in the amount of proteins and lipids and their replacement by fatty acids and other substances produced as degradation products much of the original substance of the brain has been replaced by a high molecular weight longchain hydrocarbon material that is as yet unidentified according to the archaeologists who have examined it the brain is odourless with a smooth surface and a resilient tofulike texture  third the human body tends to decay from the inside out consumed by a postmortem swarm of bacteria from the gut which spread around the body via blood from the alimentary tract in this particular case the head was severed from the alimentary tract and drained of blood so the intestinal bacteria did not have an opportunity to contaminate it the precise mechanism by which the heslington brain was preserved is unclear however in a bid to shed light on this question researchers have buried a number of pigs heads in and around the campus to see what happens to them

V the spleen from greek \u03c3\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03bdspl\u1e17n  is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates similar in structure to a large lymph node it acts primarily as a blood filter the spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells also referred to as erythrocytes and the immune system  it removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock and also recycles iron as a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent erythrocytes the globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin which is removed in the liver  the spleen synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and removes antibodycoated bacteria and antibodycoated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation a study published in 2009 using mice found that the spleen contains in its reserve half of the bodys monocytes within the red pulp  these monocytes upon moving to injured tissue such as the heart turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing    the spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and can be considered analogous to a large lymph node as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections  in humans the spleen is brownish in color and is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen     the spleen in healthy adult humans is approximately 7 centimetres 28in to 14 centimetres 55in in length it usually weighs between 150 grams 53oz  and 200 grams 71oz  an easy way to remember the anatomy of the spleen is the 1357911 rule the spleen is 1 by 3 by 5 weighs approximately 7 oz and lies between the 9th and 11th ribs on the left hand side the diaphragmatic surface of the spleen or phrenic surface is convex smooth and is directed upward backward and to the left except at its upper end where it is directed slightly to the middle it is in relation with the under surface of the diaphragm which separates it from the ninth tenth and eleventh ribs of the left side and the intervening lower border of the left lung and pleura the visceral surface of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions an anterior or gastric and a posterior or renal the gastric surface facies gastrica is directed forward upward and toward the middle is broad and concave and is in contact with the posterior wall of the stomach below this it is in contact with the tail of the pancreas near to its midborder is a long fissure the splenic hilum the hilum is the point of attachment for the gastrosplenic ligament and the point of insertion for the splenic artery and splenic vein there are other openings present for lymphatic vessels and nerves the renal surface facies renalis is directed medialward and downward it is somewhat flattened considerably narrower than the gastric surface and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the left kidney and occasionally with the left suprarenal gland like the thymus the spleen possesses only efferent lymphatic vessels the spleen is part of the lymphatic system both the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood  the germinal centers are supplied by arterioles called penicilliary radicles  the spleen is unique in respect to its development within the gut while most of the gut viscera are endodermally derived with the exception of the neuralcrest derived suprarenal gland the spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue  specifically the spleen forms within and from the dorsal mesentery however it still shares the same blood supplythe celiac trunkas the foregut organs other functions of the spleen are less prominent especially in the healthy adult disorders include splenomegaly where the spleen is enlarged for various reasons such as cancer specifically bloodbased leukemias and asplenia where the spleen is not present or functions abnormally traumas such as a motor vehicle accident can cause rupture of the spleen which is a situation requiring immediate medical attention asplenia refers to a nonfunctioning spleen which may be congenital damaged by trauma or caused by disease such as sickle cell anaemia hyposplenia refers to a partially functioning spleen these conditions may cause  a modest increase in circulating white blood cells and platelets a diminished response to some vaccines and an increased susceptibility to infection in particular there is an increased risk of sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria encapsulated bacteria inhibit binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting with macrophage receptors natural antibodies are required for phagocytosis which are immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis either directly or by complement deposition on the capsule they are produced by igm memory b cells a subtype of b cells in the marginal zone of the spleen   a splenectomy removal of the spleen also causes asplenia and results in a greatly diminished frequency of memory b cells  a 28year followup of 740 world war ii veterans who had their spleens removed on the battlefield showed a significant increase in the usual death rate from pneumonia 6 rather than the expected 13 and an increase in the death rate from ischemic heart disease 41 rather than the expected 30 but not from other conditions  an accessory spleen is a small splenic nodule extra to the spleen usually formed in early embryogenesis accessory spleens are found in approximately 10 percent of the population  and are typically around 1 centimeter in diameter splenosis is a condition where displaced pieces of splenic tissue often following trauma or splenectomy autotransplant in the abdominal cavity as accessory spleens  polysplenia is a congenital disease manifested by multiple small accessory spleens  rather than a single fullsized normal spleen polysplenia sometimes occurs alone but it is often accompanied by other developmental abnormalities such as intestinal malrotation or biliary atresia or cardiac abnormalities such as dextrocardia these accessory spleens are nonfunctional the word spleen comes from the ancient greek \u03c3\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd spl\u1e17n and is the idiomatic equivalent of the heart in english ie to be goodspleened \u03b5\u1f54\u03c3\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 eúsplankhnos means to be goodhearted or compassionate  in english the word spleen was customary during the period of the 18th century authors like richard blackmore or george cheyne employed it to characterise the hypochondriacal and hysterical affections   william shakespeare in julius caesar uses the spleen to describe cassius irritable nature must i observe you must i stand and crouchunder your testy humour by the godsyou shall digest the venom of your spleenthough it do split you for from this day forthill use you for my mirth yea for my laughterwhen you are waspish  in french splénétique refers to a state of pensive sadness or melancholy it has been popularized by the poet charles baudelaire 18211867 but was already used before in particular to the romantic literature 19th century the word for the organ is rate the connection between spleen the organ and melancholy the temperament comes from the humoral medicine of the ancient greeks one of the humours body fluid was the black bile secreted by the spleen organ and associated with melancholy in contrast the talmud tractate berachoth 61b refers to the spleen as the organ of laughter while possibly suggesting a link with the humoral view of the organ in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury england women in bad humor were said to be afflicted by the spleen or the vapours of the spleen in modern english to vent ones spleen means to vent ones anger eg by shouting and can be applied to both males and females similarly the english term splenetic is used to describe a person in a foul mood in cartilaginous and rayfinned fish it consists primarily of red pulp and is normally a somewhat elongated organ as it actually lies inside the serosal lining of the intestine in many amphibians especially frogs it takes on the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of white pulp  in reptiles birds and mammals white pulp is always relatively plentiful and in the latter two groups the spleen is typically rounded although it adjusts its shape somewhat to the arrangement of the surrounding organs in the great majority of vertebrates the spleen continues to produce red blood cells throughout life it is only in mammals that this function is lost in adults many mammals have tiny spleenlike structures known as haemal nodes throughout the body that are presumed to have the same function as the spleen  the spleens of aquatic mammals differ in some ways from those of fully landdwelling mammals in general they are bluish in colour in cetaceans and manatees they tend to be quite small but in deep diving pinnipeds they can be quite massive due to their function of storing red blood cells the only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the lampreys and hagfishes even in these animals there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue within the gut wall which has a similar structure to red pulp and is presumed to be homologous with the spleen of higher vertebrates  in mice the spleen stores half the bodys monocytes so that upon injury they can migrate to the injured tissue and transform into dendritic cells and macrophages and so assist wound healing  the celiac artery and its branch horizontal disposition of the peritoneum in the upper part of the abdomen transverse section of the spleen showing the

V how to create a mind the secret of human thought revealed is a nonfiction book about brains both human and artificial by inventor and futurist ray kurzweil first published in hardcover on november 13 2012 by viking press  it became a new york times best seller  it has received attention from the washington post the new york times and the new yorker kurzweil describes a series of thought experiments which suggest to him that the brain contains a hierarchy of pattern recognizers based on this he introduces his pattern recognition theory of mind he says the neocortex contains 300 million very general pattern recognition circuits and argues that they are responsible for most aspects of human thought he also suggests that the brain is a recursive probabilistic fractal whose line of code is represented within the 30100 million bytes of compressed code in the genome kurzweil then explains that a computer version of this design could be used to create an artificial intelligence more capable than the human brain it would employ techniques such as hidden markov models and genetic algorithms strategies kurzweil used successfully in his years as a commercial developer of speech recognition software artificial brains will require massive computational power so kurzweil reviews his law of accelerating returns which explains how the compounding effects of exponential growth will deliver the necessary hardware in only a few decades critics felt the subtitle of the book the secret of human thought revealed overpromises some protested that pattern recognition does not explain the depth and nuance  of mind including elements like emotion and imagination others felt kurzweils ideas might be right but they are not original pointing to existing work as far back as the 1980s yet critics admire kurzweils impressive track record  and say that his writing is refreshingly clear  containing lucid discussions  of computing history   kurzweil has written several futurology books  including the age of intelligent machines 1990 the age of spiritual machines 1999 and the singularity is near 2005 in his books he develops the law of accelerating returns the law is similar to moores law the persistent doubling in capacity of computer chips but extended to all human technological advancement the billions of years of terrestrial evolution and even the entire history of the universe  due to the exponential growth in computing technologies predicted by the law kurzweil says that by the end of the 2020s computers will have intelligence indistinguishable to biological humans  as computational power continues to grow machine intelligence will represent an ever larger percentage of total intelligence on the planet ultimately it will lead to the singularity a merger between biology and technology which kurzweil predicts will occur in 2045  he says there will be no distinction postsingularity between human and machine  kurzweil himself plans to stick around  for the singularity he has written two health and nutrition books aimed at living longer the subtitle of one is live long enough to live forever  one month after how to create a mind was published google announced that it had hired kurzweil to work as director of engineering on new projects involving machine learning and language processing  kurzweil said his goal at google is to create a truly useful ai artificial intelligence that will make all of us smarter  kurzweil opens the book by reminding us of the importance of thought experiments in the development of major theories including evolution and relativity  he suggests his own thought experiments related to how the brain thinks and remembers things for example he asks the reader to recite the alphabet but then to recite the alphabet backwards the difficulty in going backwards suggests our memories are sequential and in order  later he asks the reader to visualize someone he has met only once or twice the difficulty here suggests there are no images videos or sound recordings stored in the brain only sequences of patterns  eventually he concludes the brain uses a hierarchy of pattern recognizers  kurzweil writes that the neocortex contains about 300 million very general pattern recognizers arranged in a hierarchy  for example to recognize a written word there might be several pattern recognizers for each different letter stroke diagonal horizontal vertical or curved the output of these recognizers would feed into higher level pattern recognizers which look for the pattern of strokes which form a letter finally a wordlevel recognizer uses the output of the letter recognizers all the while signals feed both forward and backward for example if a letter is obscured but the remaining letters strongly indicate a certain word the wordlevel recognizer might suggest to the letterrecognizer which letter to look for and the letterlevel would suggest which strokes to look for kurzweil also discusses how listening to speech requires similar hierarchical pattern recognizers  kurzweils main thesis is that these hierarchical pattern recognizers are used not just for sensing the world but for nearly all aspects of thought for example kurzweil says memory recall is based on the same patterns that were used when sensing the world in the first place kurzweil says that learning is critical to human intelligence a computer version of the neocortex would initially be like a new born baby unable to do much only through repeated exposure to patterns would it eventually selforganize and become functional  kurzweil writes extensively about neuroanatomy of both the neocortex and the old brain  he cites recent evidence that interconnections in the neocortex form a grid structure which suggests to him a common algorithm across all neocortical functions  kurzweil next writes about creating a digital brain inspired by the biological brain he has been describing one existing effort he points to is henry markrams blue brain project which is attempting to create a full brain simulation by 2023  kurzweil says the full molecular modeling they are attempting will be too slow and that they will have to swap in simplified models to speed up initial selforganization  kurzweil believes these large scale simulations are valuable but says a more explicit functional algorithmic model will be required to achieve human levels of intelligence  kurzweil is unimpressed with neural networks and their potential while hes very bullish on vector quantization hidden markov models and genetic algorithms since he used all three successfully in his speech recognition work  kurzweil equates pattern recognizers in the neocortex with statements in the lisp programming language which is also hierarchical  he also says his approach is similar to jeff hawkins hierarchical temporal memory although he feels the hierarchical hidden markov models have an advantage in pattern detection  kurzweil touches on some modern applications of advanced ai including googles selfdriving cars ibms watson which beat the best human players at the game jeopardy the siri personal assistant in the apple iphone or its competitor google voice search he contrasts the handcoded knowledge of the douglas lenats cyc project with the automated learning of systems like google translate and suggests the best approach is to use a combination of both which is how ibms watson was so effective  kurzweil says that john searles has leveled his chinese room objection at watson arguing that watson only manipulates symbols without meaning kurzweil thinks the human brain is just doing hierarchical statistical analysis as well  in a section entitled a strategy for creating a mind kurzweil summarizes how he would put together a digital mind he would start with a pattern recognizer and arrange for a hierarchy to selforganize using a hierarchical hidden markov model all parameters of the system would be optimized using genetic algorithms he would add in a critical thinking module to scan existing patterns in the background for incompatibilities to avoid holding inconsistent ideas kurzweil says the brain should have access to open questions in every discipline and have the ability to master vast databases something traditional computers are good at he feels the final digital brain would be as capable as biological ones of effecting changes in the world  a digital brain with humanlevel intelligence raises many philosophical questions the first of which is whether it is conscious kurzweil feels that consciousness is an emergent property of a complex physical system such that a computer emulating a brain would have the same emergent consciousness as the real brain this is in contrast to people like john searle stuart hameroff and roger penrose who believe there is something special about the physical brain that a computer version could not duplicate  another issue is that of free will the degree to which people are responsible for their own choices free will relates to determinism if everything is strictly determined by prior state then some would say that no one can have free will kurzweil holds a pragmatic belief in free will because he feels society needs it to function he also suggests that quantum mechanics may provide a continual source of uncertainty at the most basic level of reality such that determinism does not exist  finally kurzweil addresses identity with futuristic scenarios involving cloning a nonbiological version of someone or gradually turning that same person into a nonbiological entity one surgery at a time in the first case it is tempting to say the clone is not the original person because the original person still exists kurzweil instead concludes both versions are equally the same person he explains that an advantage of nonbiological systems is the ability to be copied backed up and recreated and this is just something people will have to get used to kurzweil believes identity is preserved through continuity of the pattern of information that makes us and that humans are not bound to a specific substrate like biology  the law of accelerating returns is the basis for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain it explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after moores law expires which kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020 integrated circuits the current method of creating computer chips will fade from the limelight while some new more advanced technology will pick up the slack it is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain  as exponential progress continues into and beyond the singularity kurzweil says we will merge with the intelligent technology we are creating  from there intelligence will expand outward rapidly kurzweil even wonders whether the speed of light is really a firm limit to civilizations ability to colonize the universe  simson garfinkel an entrepreneur and professor of computer science at the naval postgraduate school says kurzweils pattern recognition theory of mind prtm is misnamed because of the word theory he feels it is not a theory since it cannot be tested garfinkel rejects kurzweils onealgorithm approach instead saying the brain is likely to have many more secrets and algorithms than the one kurzweil describes garfinkel caricatures kurzweils plan for artificial intelligence as build something that can learn then give it stuff to learn which he thinks is hardly the secret of human thought promised by the subtitle of the book  gary marcus a research psychologist and professor at new york university says only the name prtm is new he says the basic theory behind prtm is in the spirit of a model of vision known as the neocognitron introduced in 1980 he also says prtm even more strongly resembles hierarchical temporal memory promoted by jeff hawkins in recent years marcus feels any theory like this needs to be proven with an actual working computer model and to that end he says that a whole slew of machines have been programmed with an approach similar to prtm and they have often performed poorly  josh raulerson a reporter and radio host who wrote his phd thesis on the singularity thinks kurzweil mistakes his prtm theory for a comprehensive model of the mind and thus calls the result philosophically naive methodologically dubious at times intellectually dishonest  and above all monstrously reductive he feels kurzweil confuses the brain with the mind where he thinks the mind has more depth and nuance as it can produce or ponder music art and literature  colin mcginn a philosophy professor at the university of miami asserted in the new york review of books that pattern recognition pertains to perception specifically not to all mental activity  while kurzweil does say memories are stored as sequences of patterns  mcginn asks about emotion imagination reasoning willing intending calculating silently talking to oneself feeling pain and pleasure itches and mood insisting these have nothing to do with pattern recognition mcginn is also critical of the homunculus language kurzweil uses the anthropomorphization of anatomical parts like neurons kurzweil will write that a neuron shouts when it sees a pattern where mcginn would prefer he say a neuron fires when it receives certain stimuli in mcginns mind only conscious entities can recognize anything a bundle of neurons cannot finally he takes objection with kurzweils law of accelerating change insisting it is not a law but just a fortunate historical fact about the twentieth century  in 2015 kurzweils theory was extended to a pattern activationrecognition theory of mind with a stochastic model of selfdescribing neural circuits  garfinkel says kurzweil is at his best with the thought experiments early in the book but says the warmth and humanitarianism evident in kurzweils talks is missing  marcus applauds kurzweil for lucid discussion of alan turing and john von neumann and was impressed by his descriptions of computer algorithms and the detailed histories of kurzweils own companies  raulerson starts by criticizing kurzweils rhetorical style and worldview as borderline autistic but he does praise how to create a mind as informative refreshingly transparent and often engrossing raulerson believes kurzweil writes as a mittrained computer scientist but also as a transhumanist vitamin salesman since he is both raulerson suggests kurzweil is a figure like nikola tesla not easily dismissed but not to be taken too seriously either  matthew feeney assistant editor for reason was disappointed in how briefly kurzweil dealt with the philosophical aspects of the mindbody problem and the ethical implications of machines which appear to be conscious he does say kurzweils optimism about an aiassisted future is contagious  while drew desilver business reporter at the seattle times says the first half of the book has all the pizazz and drive of an engineering manual but says kurzweils description of how the jeopardy computer champion watson worked is eyeopening and refreshingly clear  mcginn says the book is interesting in places fairly readable moderately informative but wildly overstated he mocks the books subtitle by writing all is revealed after paraphrasing kurzweils pattern recognition theory of mind speaking as a philosopher mcginn feels that kurzweil is way of out of his depth when discussing wittgenstein  matt ridley journalist and author wrote in the wall street journal that kurzweil has a more impressive track record of predicting technological progress than most and therefore he feels it would be foolish not wise to bet against the emulation of the human brain in silicon within a couple of decades

V witchs milk or neonatal milk is milk secreted from the breasts of some newborn human infants of either sex  neonatal milk secretion is considered a normal physiological occurrence and no treatment or testing is necessary  it is thought to be caused by a combination of the effects of maternal hormones before birth prolactin and growth hormone passed through breastfeeding and the postnatal pituitary and thyroid hormone surge in the infant breast milk production occurs in about 5 of newborns and can persist for two months though breast buds can persist into childhood witchs milk is more likely to be secreted by infants born at full term and not by prematurelyborn infants  the consistence of neonatal milk was estimated to be very similar to maternal milk  neonatal milk production may be also sometimes caused by medications  in extremely rare cases neonatal mastitis may develop but it is unclear if it is related to neonatal milk secretion in some cultures the tradition of removing the milk milking has been reported this practice can prolong milk production and other problems can not be excluded  while breastfeeding may also contribute to prolonged milk production and breast enlargement temporary or permanent weaning is not recommended in folklore witchs milk was believed to be a source of nourishment for witches familiar spirits  it was thought to be stolen from unwatched sleeping infants in other cultures expressing milk from the infants breasts is supposed to contribute to a good breast shape in adulthood  blood from the nipples is nearly always benign and frequently associated with duct ectasia it should only be investigated when it is unilateral

V in earlier conceptions of kidney biology the nephrotome was a section of the mesoderm that gives rise to the pronephros and eventually to the rest of the kidney older texts describe the pronephros as forming through the fusion of multiple nephrotomes modern visualization methods such as scanning electron microscopy in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy combined with the simple approach of peeling off the epidermis to see the forming kidney have shown that this is not the case nephric mesenchyme separates from the intermediate mesoderm as a single elongated primordia as this primordia begins to undergo epithelialization the anterior portions of the pronephros form rounded protrusions which then later become the dorsal branches of the pronephros that link to nephrostomes distinct from nephrotomes these rounded bumps are probably the structures observed in histological sections that are referred to as nephrotomes nephrotomes are not related to nephrostomes which are thin ciliated funnels that link pronephric nephrons to the ceolom

V the placenta also known as afterbirth is an organ that connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake provide thermoregulation to the fetus waste elimination and gas exchange via the mothers blood supply fight against internal infection and produce hormones to support pregnancy the placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to growing babies and removes waste products from the babys blood the placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus and the babys umbilical cord develops from the placenta the umbilical cord is what connects the mother and the baby placentas are a defining characteristic of placental mammals but are also found in some nonmammals with varying levels of development  the homology of such structures in various viviparous organisms is debatable and in invertebrates such as arthropoda is analogous at best the word placenta comes from the latin word for cake from greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 plakóentaplakoúnta accusative of

placentae but the form placentas is common in modern english and probably has the wider currency at present prototherial egglaying and metatherial marsupial mammals produce a choriovitelline placenta that while connected to the uterine wall provides nutrients mainly derived from the egg sac the placenta functions as a fetomaternal organ with two components the fetal placenta chorion frondosum which develops from the same blastocyst that forms the fetus and the maternal placenta decidua basalis which develops from the maternal uterine tissue    in humans the placenta averages 22cm 9inch in length and 225cm 081inch in thickness with the center being the thickest and the edges being the thinnest it typically weighs approximately 500grams just over 1lb it has a dark reddishblue or crimson color it connects to the fetus by an umbilical cord of approximately 5560cm 2224inch in length which contains two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein  the umbilical cord inserts into the chorionic plate has an eccentric attachment vessels branch out over the surface of the placenta and further divide to form a network covered by a thin layer of cells this results in the formation of villous tree structures on the maternal side these villous tree structures are grouped into lobules called cotyledons in humans the placenta usually has a disc shape but size varies vastly between different mammalian species  the placenta begins to develop upon implantation of the blastocyst into the maternal endometrium the outer layer of the blastocyst becomes the trophoblast which forms the outer layer of the placenta this outer layer is divided into two further layers the underlying cytotrophoblast layer and the overlying syncytiotrophoblast layer the syncytiotrophoblast is a multinucleated continuous cell layer that covers the surface of the placenta it forms as a result of differentiation and fusion of the underlying cytotrophoblast cells a process that continues throughout placental development the syncytiotrophoblast otherwise known as syncytium thereby contributes to the barrier function of the placenta the placenta grows throughout pregnancy development of the maternal blood supply to the placenta is complete by the end of the first trimester of pregnancy approximately 1213weeks in preparation for implantation of the blastocyst the uterine endometrium undergoes decidualisation spiral arteries in decidua are remodeled so that they become less convoluted and their diameter is increased the increased diameter and straighter flow path both act to increase maternal blood flow to the placenta the relatively high pressure as the maternal blood fills intervillous space through these spiral arteries bathes the fetal villi in blood allowing an exchange of gases to take place in humans and other hemochorial placentals the maternal blood comes into direct contact with the fetal chorion though no fluid is exchanged as the pressure decreases between pulses the deoxygenated blood flows back through the endometrial veins maternal blood flow is approximately 600700mlmin at term deoxygenated fetal blood passes through umbilical arteries to the placenta at the junction of umbilical cord and placenta the umbilical arteries branch radially to form chorionic arteries chorionic arteries in turn branch into cotyledon arteries in the villi these vessels eventually branch to form an extensive arteriocapillaryvenous system bringing the fetal blood extremely close to the maternal blood but no intermingling of fetal and maternal blood occurs placental barrier  endothelin and prostanoids cause vasoconstriction in placental arteries while nitric oxide causes vasodilation  on the other hand there is no neural vascular regulation and catecholamines have only little effect  the fetoplacental circulation is vulnerable to persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation which can lead to generation of excessive free radicals this may contribute to preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications  it is proposed that melatonin plays a role as an antioxidant in the placenta  placental expulsion begins as a physiological separation from the wall of the uterus the period from just after the child is born until just after the placenta is expelled is called the third stage of labor the placenta is usually expelled within 1530minutes of birth placental expulsion can be managed actively for example by giving oxytocin via intramuscular injection followed by cord traction to assist in delivering the placenta alternatively it can be managed expectantly allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance a cochrane study suggests that blood loss and the risk of postpartum bleeding will be reduced in women offered active management of the third stage of labour  the habit is to cut the cord immediately after birth but allegedly there is no medical reason to do that on the contrary it is theorized that not cutting the cord helps the baby in its adaptation to extrauterine life especially in preterm infants  the perfusion of the intervillous spaces of the placenta with maternal blood allows the transfer of nutrients and oxygen from the mother to the fetus and the transfer of waste products and carbon dioxide back from the fetus to the maternal blood supply nutrient transfer to the fetus occurs via both active and passive transport active transport systems allow significantly different plasma concentrations of various large molecules to be maintained on the maternal and fetal sides of the placental barrier  adverse pregnancy situations such as those involving maternal diabetes or obesity can increase or decrease levels of nutrient transporters in the placenta resulting in overgrowth or restricted growth of the fetus  waste products excreted from the fetus such as urea uric acid and creatinine are transferred to the maternal blood by diffusion across the placenta igg antibodies can pass through the human placenta thereby providing protection to the fetus in utero  this transfer of antibodies begins as early as the 20th week of gestational age and certainly by the 24th week  this passive immunity lingers for several months after birth thus providing the newborn with a carbon copy of the mothers longterm humoral immunity to see the infant through the crucial first months of extrauterine life igm however cannot cross the placenta which is why some infections acquired during pregnancy can be hazardous for the fetus furthermore the placenta functions as a selective maternalfetal barrier against transmission of microbes however insufficiency in this function may still cause mothertochild transmission of infectious diseases the placenta among many of its other functions also secretes hormones that are essential to fetal life the placenta and fetus may be regarded as a foreign allograft inside the mother and thus must evade from attack by the mothers immune system for this purpose the placenta uses several mechanisms however the placental barrier is not the sole means to evade the immune system as foreign fetal cells also persist in the maternal circulation on the other side of the placental barrier  the placenta also provides a reservoir of blood for the fetus delivering blood to it in case of hypotension and vice versa comparable to a capacitor  numerous pathologies can affect the placenta infections involving the placenta the placenta often plays an important role in various cultures with many societies conducting rituals regarding its disposal in the western world the placenta is most often incinerated  some cultures bury the placenta for various reasons the m\u0101ori of new zealand traditionally bury the placenta from a newborn child to emphasize the relationship between humans and the earth  likewise the navajo bury the placenta and umbilical cord at a specially chosen site  particularly if the baby dies during birth  in cambodia and costa rica burial of the placenta is believed to protect and ensure the health of the baby and the mother  if a mother dies in childbirth the aymara of bolivia bury the placenta in a secret place so that the mothers spirit will not return to claim her babys life  the placenta is believed by some communities to have power over the lives of the baby or its parents the kwakiutl of british columbia bury girls placentas to give the girl skill in digging clams and expose boys placentas to ravens to encourage future prophetic visions in turkey the proper disposal of the placenta and umbilical cord is believed to promote devoutness in the child later in life in ukraine transylvania and japan interaction with a disposed placenta is thought to influence the parents future fertility several cultures believe the placenta to be or have been alive often a relative of the baby nepalese think of the placenta as a friend of the baby malaysian orang asli regard it as the babys older sibling the igbo of nigeria consider the placenta the deceased twin of the baby and conduct full funeral rites for it  native hawaiians believe that the placenta is a part of the baby and traditionally plant it with a tree that can then grow alongside the child  various cultures in indonesia such as javanese believe that the placenta has a spirit and needs to be buried outside the family house in some cultures the placenta is eaten a practice known as placentophagy in some eastern cultures such as china the dried placenta ziheche \u7d2b\u6cb3\u8eca lit purple river cart is thought to be a healthful restorative and is sometimes used in preparations of traditional chinese medicine and various health products  the practice of human placentophagy has become a more recent

V as a paraphilia breast fetishism also known as mastofact breast partialism or mazophilia  is a highly atypical sexual interest focused on female breasts see partialism  the term breast fetishism is also used in the nonparaphilic sense to refer to cultural attention to female breasts and the sexuality they represent with debate existing as to whether the modern widespread fascination with breasts among heterosexual males in western societies is a sexual fetish    scientists have hypothesized that nonparaphilic sexual attraction to breasts is the result of their function as a secondary sex characteristic for instance zoologist and ethologist desmond morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks which according to morris in the naked ape is also unique to humans other primates as a rule having much flatter buttocks  evolutionary psychologists theorize that humans permanently enlarged breasts in contrast to other primates breasts which only enlarge during ovulation allows human females to solicit human male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile  the reverence and theorizing shown to breasts also appears in the science of modern civilization breast fetishism is claimed to be an example of a contagious thought or meme spreading throughout society and that breasts are features that have evolved to influence human sexuality rather than serve an exclusive maternal function  in clinical literature of the 19th century the sexual focus on breasts was considered a form of paraphillia but in modern times this attraction is considered normal unless it is highly atypical and is therefore a form of partialism  the term breast fetishism is also used within ethnographic and feminist contexts to describe a society with a culture devoted to breasts usually as sexual objects   some feminists have argued that incidences of breast fetishism have been found going back to the neolithic era with the goddess shrines of catal huyuk in modern turkey the archaeological excavations of the town in c 1960 revealed the walls of the shrines adorned with disembodied pairs of breasts that appeared to have an existence of their own elizabeth gould davis argues that breasts along with phalluses were revered by the women of catal huyuk as instruments of motherhood but it was after what she describes as a patriarchal revolution  when men had appropriated both phallus worship and the breast fetish for themselves  that these organs acquired the erotic significance with which they are now endowed  some authors from the united states have made the statement that attraction to the female breast is a sexual fetish that it is the american fetishobject of choice  and that breast fetishism is predominantly found in the united states    there is a widespread fascination with womens breasts and especially their size  modern female fashions which focus on tight clothing and the display of cleavage have been attributed to the increase in breast fetishism  many people in western culture both male and female consider breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic  an important aspect of femininity and many women use décolletage or a low neckline that exposes cleavage as part of their physical and sexual attractiveness display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction as well as aesthetic or erotic most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a womans breasts  and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage when cleavage is enhanced with a pushup bra or exposed by a low neckline it may draw attention  during adolescence some girls become obsessed with body image including breast size and shape  in south africa wonderbra sponsors a national cleavage day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage  in western and some other societies there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public  in contemporary western society the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by dress codes in some settings such as workplaces churches and schools while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged the exposure of nipples or areolae is almost always considered toplessness considered by some to be immodest and in some instances as lewd or indecent behavior  art historian james laver argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the western world  film producers such as russ meyer produced films which featured actresses with large breasts lorna 1964 was the first of his films where the main female part was selected on the basis of breast size other large breasted actresses used by meyer include kitten natividad erica gavin lorna maitland tura satana and uschi digard among many others the majority of them were naturally large breasted and he occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy to enhance their breast size even further  author and director william rotsler said with lorna meyer established the formula that made him rich and famous the formula of people filmed at top hate top lust top heavy  the practice of breast augmentation has become more common

V the murder of human beings for their body parts is widely condemned and considered a crime under the law of most countries such practices have been confirmed or suspected to occur within a handful of contexts medicine murder not to be confused with medical murder due to medical negligence means the killing of a human being in order to excise body parts to use as medicine or for magical purposes in witchcraft medicine murder is not viewed as a form of human sacrifice in a religious sense because the motivation is not the death of a human or the effecting of magical changes through the death of a human being but the obtaining of an item or items from their corpse to be used in traditional medicine its practice in the format described below occurs primarily in subequatorial africa  medicine murder in southern africa has been documented in some small detail in south africa lesotho and swaziland although it is a difficult subject to investigate because of its controversial standing in customary practices and laws very few research and discussion documents have been devoted to this subject three concerning lesotho were published in 1951 2000 and 2005 regarding the same events in the 1940s and 1950s one concerning swaziland was published in 1993 covering the 1970s and 1980s and a commission of enquiry held in south africa in 1995 covering medicine murder and witchcraft in the 1980s and 1990s the illegal organ trade has at times led to murder for body parts because of a worldwide demand of organs for transplant and organ donors at times criminal organizations have engaged in kidnapping people especially children and teens with the victims being killed and their organs harvested for the illegal organ trade   the extent is unknown and nonfatal organ theft and removal is more widely reported than murder in 2006 china was reported to be using its extensive pool of falun gong political prisoners as a supply for body parts to be used in transplants the allegations and supporting testimony were raised in several countries and seen as deeply disturbing reports     and testimony found that such prisoners were routinely assessed for transplants and apparent tissue typing in a manner with no relevance to ordinary patient wellbeing and that many were subsequently executed to meet demand for matching organs data on availability and speed of transplants within china under 2  3 weeks in some cases compared to years elsewhere led several renowned doctors to state that the statistics and transplant rates seen would be impossible without access to a very large pool of preexisting donors already available on very short notice for hearts and other organs several governments also established restrictions intended to target such a practice  china denied such practices historically anatomy murders took place during the earlier parts of modern western medicine in the 19th century the human body was still poorly understood but fresh cadavers for dissection and anatomical study were sometimes difficult to obtain mortuaries remained the most common source but in some cases such as the notorious irish murderers burke and hare victims were killed instead and the killers then sold the bodies for study the practice has intermittently been reported since that time in 1992 colombian activist juan pablo ordoñez claimed that 14 poor residents of the town of barranquilla had been killed for local medical study  with a purported account by an alleged escapee being publicized by the international press    the objective of medicine murder is to create traditional medicine based partly on human flesh medicine murder is often termed ritual murder or muthi  muti murder although there is evidence to suggest that the degree of ritual involved in the making of medicine is only a small element of the practice overall social anthropological ethnographies have documented anecdotes of medicine murder in southern africa since the 1800s and research has shown that incidences of medicine murder increase in times of political and economic stress the practice is commonly associated with witchcraft although ethnographic evidence suggests that this has not always been the case and that it may have been accorded locallevel political sanction medicine murder is difficult to describe concisely as it has changed over time involving an evergreater variety of perpetrator victim method and motive most detailed information about the minutiae of medicine murder is derived from state witnesses in trials court records and thirdparty anecdote the phenomenon is widely acknowledged to occur in southern africa although no country has issued an accurate and up to date record of the frequency with which it takes place this is not only because of the secrecy of the practice given its controversial status but also because of difficulties in classifying subcategories of murder medicine murder has been a topic of urban legends in south africa but this does not diminish its status as a practice that has resulted in legal trials and convictions of perpetrators the perpetrators are usually men although women have been convicted as well most notably in swaziland when phillippa mdluli   was hanged in 1983 for commissioning a medicine murder perpetrators vary widely in age and social status an individual or group of individuals commissions a traditional healer or inyanga  nanga a herbalist skilled in traditional medicine to assist them by concocting medicine or muti the medicine supposedly strengthens the personality or personal force of the person who commissions the medicine this increased personal force enables the person to excel in business politics or other sphere of influence a human victim is identified for murder in order to create the medicine victims vary widely in age and social standing they are often young children or elderly people and are both male and female in some instances the victim is identified and purchased via a transaction involving an often nominal amount of money the victim is then abducted often at night and taken to an isolated place often in the open countryside if the murder is being committed in a rural area it is usually intended that the victim be mutilated while conscious so that the medicine can be made more potent through the noises of the victim in agony mutilation does not take place in order to kill the victim but it is expected that the victim will die of the wounds body parts excised mostly include soft tissue eyelids lips scrota labia although there have been instances where entire limbs have been severed these body parts are removed to be mixed with medicinal plants to create a medicine through a cooking process the resulting medicine is sometimes consumed but is often made into a paste that is carried on the person of the perpetrator or rubbed onto scarifications since the 1970s the manner in which medicine murder is practiced has become altered to the methods described above although the continued practice of medicine murder demonstrates that belief in human flesh as a powerful medicinal component remains strong in some communities it would appear that medicine murder in the 18th and 19th centuries may have been considered the legitimate domain of traditional chiefs and leaders in order to improve agriculture and protect against war see human sacrifice following industrialisation and growth of commerce the range of purposes for which medicine was used to increase influence expanded significantly in the early 1990s when south africa was experiencing internal political strife between several political groupings it became clear that some mutilations for medicine were opportunistic and incidental to the assassination of political opponents there have also been occurrences of mutilation of corpses in medical facilities in not all cases does the employment of a traditional healer seem to have been thought necessary to the process in 1994 a 14yearold named segametsi mogomotsi was murdered in mochudi botswana and body parts removed the killing was widely believed to have been for muti and the police even recovered some excised organs however these were destroyed before being tested to establish them as human leading to accusations of police complicity with the murder the killing led to riots as students in mochudi protested about police inaction and eventually scotland yard from britain were asked to investigate as neutral outsiders their report was given to the botswana government which did not release it to the public these events inspired some of the events in the book the no 1 ladies detective agency by alexander mccall smith a little boy whose headless and limbless body was found floating in the thames in 2001 was identified by an arrestee in march 2011 the fiveyearolds identity has remained a mystery after he was smuggled into britain and murdered in a voodoostyle ritual killing he was drugged with a blackmagic potion and sacrificed before being thrown into the thames where his torso washed up next to the globe theatre in september 2001 detectives used pioneering scientific techniques to trace radioactive isotopes in his bones to his native nigeria they even enlisted nelson mandela to appeal for information about the murder  they struggled to formally identify the boy whom they called adam despite travelling to the west african state to try to trace his family nigerian joyce osiagede the only person to be arrested in britain as part of the inquiry has claimed that the victims real name is ikpomwosa in an interview with itvs london tonight mrs osiagede said she looked after the boy in germany for a year before travelling to britain without him in 2001 she claimed she handed the boy over to a man known as bawa who later told her that he was dead and threatened to kill her unless she kept silent police have passed numerous files on the case to the crown prosecution service but it has never gone to court a second suspect a nigerian man was arrested in dublin in 2003 but was never charged mrs osiagede was first questioned by police after they found clothing similar to that worn by adam in her glasgow towerblock flat in 2002 the only clothing on his body was a pair of orange shorts exclusively sold in woolworths in germany and austria dressed in a traditional gold and green dress mrs osiagede denied any involvement with the death of the young boy asked who killed him she said a group of people she added they used him for a ritual in the water claiming the boy was six years old she said he was a lively boy a very nice boy he was also intelligent detailed analysis of a substance in the boys stomach was identified as a black magic potion it included tiny clay pellets containing small particles of pure gold an indication that adam was the victim of a muti ritual killing in which it is believed that the body parts of children are sacred bodies are often disposed of in flowing water masego kgomo was a 10yearold south african girl whose body parts were removed and sold to a sangoma in soshanguve south africa the little girls body was found in bushes near the mabopane railway station northwest of pretoria thirtyyearold brian mangwale was found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment  according to the world health organization who illegal organ trade occurs when organs are removed from the body for the purpose of commercial transactions  the illegal organ trade is growing and a recent report by global financial integrity estimates that globally it generates profits between 06 billion and 12 billion per year in some cases criminal organizations have engaged in kidnapping of people especially children and teens who are murdered and their organs harvested for profit   in 2014 an alleged member of the mexican knights templar cartel was arrested for the kidnapping and deaths of minors after children were found wrapped in blankets and stuffed in a refrigerated container inside a van   according to the most recent bulletin of the world health organization on the state of the international organ trade  66000 kidney transplants 21000 liver transplants and 6000 heart transplants were performed globally in 2005  while another article reports that 2008 the median waiting time for the us transplant list in 2008 was greater than 3 years and expected to rise while the united kingdom reported a lack of organs for 8000 patients with the rate increasing at 8  it was estimated that about 10 of all transplants occur illegally with the internet acting as a facilitator transplant tourism raises concerns because it involves the transfer of healthy organs in one direction depleting the regions where organs are bought this transfer typically occurs from south to north developing to developed nations females to males and from people of color to whites a trend that experts say has exacerbated olddivisions  while some organs such as the kidney can be transplanted routinely and the single remaining kidney is adequate for normal human needs other organs are less easy to source liver transplants in particular are prominent but incur an excruciating recovery that deters donations  most countries have laws which criminalize the buying and selling of organs or the carrying out of medical procedures for the illegal organ trade  in march 2006 three individuals alleged that thousands of falun gong practitioners had been killed at sujiatun thrombosis hospital to supply chinas organ transplant industry    the third person a doctor said the socalled hospitals in sujiatun are but one of 36 similar concentration camps all over china  the allegations were the subject of investigative reports by edward mcmillanscott  vicepresident of the european parliament and by former canadian secretary of state david kilgour and human rights lawyer david matas  the kilgourmatas report    stated the source of 41500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained and concluded that there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling falun gong practitioners  the report called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in chinaone to two weeks for a liver compared with 325 months in canadanoting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in china beginning in 1999 corresponded with the onset of the persecution of falun gong despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation china performs the secondhighest number of transplants per year the report includes incriminating material from chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors and transcripts of interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain falun gong organs  an updated version of their report was published as a book in 2009   in 2014 investigative journalist ethan gutmann published his own investigation  he conducted extensive interviews with former detainees of chinese labor camps and prisons as well as former security officers and medical professionals with knowledge of chinas transplant practices   he reported that organ harvesting from political prisoners likely began in xinjiang province in the 1990s and then spread nationwide gutmann estimates 65000 falun gong prisoners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008  the extent of evidence still led to many responses expressing deep concerns at the findings and several countries took action as a result of the concerns and findings  responses were noted from the us government the us national kidney foundation deeply concerned  and the queensland ministry of health in australia abolished training programs for chinese doctors in organ transplant procedures and banned joint research with china on organ transplantation  a petition signed by 140 canadian physicians urged the government to warn canadian nationals that organ transplants in china were sourced almost entirely from nonconsenting people   in 2012 state organs transplant abuse in china edited by david matas and dr torsten trey was published with contributions from 12 specialists  several of the essays in the book conclude that a primary source of organs has been prisoners of conscience specifically practitioners of falun gong  in may 2008 two united nations special rapporteurs reiterated their requests for the chinese government to fully explain the allegation of taking vital organs from falun gong practitioners and the source of organs for the sudden increase in organ transplants in china since 2000  in august 2009 manfred nowak the united nations special rapporteur on torture said the chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparent  it remains to be seen how it could be possible that organ transplant surgeries in chinese hospitals have risen massively since 1999 while there are never that many voluntary donors available  an anatomy murder sometimes called burking in british english is a murder committed in order for all or part of the cadaver to be used for medical research or teaching it is not a medicine murder because the body parts are not believed to have any medicinal use in themselves the motive for the murder is created by the demand for cadavers for dissection and the opportunity to learn anatomy and physiology as a result of the dissection rumors concerning the prevalence of anatomy murders are associated with the rise in demand for cadavers in research and teaching produced by the scientific revolution during the nineteenth century the sensational serial murders associated with burke and hare and the london burkers led to legislation which provided scientists and medical schools with legal ways of obtaining cadavers rumors persist that anatomy murders are carried out wherever there is a high demand for cadavers these rumors are hard to substantiate and may reflect continued deepheld fears of the use of cadavers as commodities

harvesting and killing of an indeterminate number of disappeared people various sources had estimated that the number of victims ranged from a handful  up to 50  between 24 to 100  to over 300  the victims were believed to be mostly ethnic serbs of kosovo killed by perpetrators with strong links to elements of the kosovo liberation army kla in 1999 according to un allegations the victims were chosen from a pool of about 100 to 300  combatants and civilians taken prisoner or kidnapped by the kla during and after the kosovo war and then allegedly taken to detention centers and private homes in northern and central albania   the un document indicates the involvement or at least knowledge of several midlevel and senior kla commanders  the men were taken to a makeshift clinic near tirana albania where they were shot in the head and then had their organs removed  the united nations un war crimes prosecutors investigated the case in 2002 and 2003 and again in 2004 but concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove that the organ harvesting ring existed  in 2010 a report by swiss prosecutor dick marty to the council of europe coe uncovered credible convergent indications  of an illegal trade in human organs going back over a decade  including the deaths of a handful of serb captives killed for this purpose  on 25 january 2011 the report was endorsed by the coe which called for a full and serious investigation since the issuance of the report however senior sources in the european union rule of law mission in kosovo eulex and many members of the european parliament have expressed serious doubts regarding the report and its foundations believing marty failed to provide any evidence concerning the allegations  a eulex special investigation was launched in august 2011 the head of the war crimes unit of eulex the european law and justice mission in kosovo matti raatikainen said the fact is that there is no evidence whatsoever in this case no bodies no witnesses all the reports and media attention to this issue have not been helpful to us in fact they have not been helpful to anyone    the allegations first appeared in the media in the hunt me and the war criminals written in 2008 by carla del ponte a former chief prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty in her book del ponte states that kosovo albanians harvested organs of kidnapped ethnic serbs after the armed conflict ended in 1999 these accusations were backed by her own visit to the site several witnesses both in and out of the icty one of whom personally made an organ delivery to an albanian airport for transport abroad and confirmed information directly gathered by the tribunal  del ponte concluded that if the case had been opened before kosovos declaration of independence world governments might not have had the same stance on the kosovo question  the swiss government ordered del ponte not to discuss the case she was accused of spreading unfounded rumors and her former press secretary distanced herself from del ponte  bernard kouchner former top un representative in kosovo stated in april 2011 we were aware of the extortions but we never heard of organ trafficking rejecting the accusations made by del ponte  after the war in kosovo american journalist michael montgomery obtained testimony from seven former kla soldiers who said they had transported prisoners dead and alive from kosovo to albania some of montgomerys sources referred to the possibility of organtrafficking and identified a small yellow farmhouse in the village of rripë near the remote town of burrel albania montgomery provided a summary of his research to the office of missing persons and forensics ompf at the united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik a team of un and icty investigators visited the house in february 2004 they found widespread traces of blood of uncertain provenance on the floor and medical surgical equipment on the rubbish dump and in the riverbed the family living in the house offered contradictory and inconsistent explanations for the blood and equipment   according to del ponte witness statements indicated that a doctor described as a kosovar from pe\u0107 might have removed the organs from up to 50 prisoners there  the villagers objected to the exhumation of the graves where the witnesses said that several victims were buried under false albanian names the un then shelved their investigation lacking the mandate to investigate crimes committed after the war had ended and also having gathered insufficient evidence to support an indictment  most of the witnesses were taken to italy for their protection and seem to have disappeared from the face of the earth having presumably gone into hiding  information obtained by the serbian radio and television b92 alleged that prisoners were trafficked in trucks from kosovo to gurrë mat in northern albania and to a kla camp in kukës during and after the kosovo war  the organ harvesting was presumably performed while the prisoners were alive in the socalled buildingprison 320  20km from the yellow house mentioned by del ponte as the site of the acts  b92 also alleged they have documents revealing that albanian prime minister sali berisha was asked by the kla leader and former kosovo prime minister ramush haradinaj to send security forces to destroy all evidence connected to the disappearance and organ harvesting of serbs from kosovo who were transported to albania  according to the serbian war crimes prosecution buildingprison 320 is a neuropsychiatric clinic we believe that surgical operations were carried out there on civilians as the conditions existed for such a thing there was a prisoner camp there as well as a kla camp  it differs markedly from what the albanian prosecutor has been saying who shut the case back in 2005  serbian war crimes prosecutor bruno vekari\u0107 asserted that an additional 40 mental patients from \u0161timlje are thought to be victims of the organ theft  however the humanitarian law center conducted an investigation into the deaths of the named victims two women with severe mental disabilities and established that the women died of natural causes and were not victims of organ trafficking  the serbian investigation was relaunched on 21 march 2008 just ahead of del pontes book release on 3 april 2008 when the countrys prosecutors claimed they had sufficient evidence to search the whole of albania for mass graves of serbs  serbia urged albania to cooperate but in late october 2008 albanian officials replied that the charges were already investigated by the un and carla del ponte and that the serbian government had no new evidence  on 14 november 2008 unmik invited serbian war crimes prosecutors to join with them in a new investigation about the yellow house  on 20 november 2008 in line with ictys commitment of cooperation with serbia current icty chief serge brammertz provided serbia evidence of the operation house in northern albania in response the albanian prosecutor said only a small amount of penicillin was found an icty report stated that seven points were confirmed in the allegations and that the albanian prosecutor and unmik failed to tell the truth when investigating the findings concerning surgical equipment  according to the un the albanian government has been trying to prevent inquiries into possible war crimes and the involvement of kla elements in organ trade  even after proof of surgical procedures in the burrel house was presented to them albanian officials claim that the allegations are speculative however human rights watch believes otherwise hrw has been conducting its own investigation into the allegations  and has been calling for an independent probe to investigate crimes by former leaders of the kla  hrw believes the allegations are credible and that simple harvesting of kidneys could have been easily performed even without surgical tools although such were found at the scene  in august 2009 albanians in the village of rripë prevented representatives of the coe under dick marty from searching houses relating to the case the locals said they would not let anyone other than the albanian government examine potential evidence although the albanian and kosovo authorities have said they will not investigate  serbian war crime prosecutors have said that new evidence has been found and that the investigation is ongoing  the council of europe is still interested in the case and embassies are sending data to the war crimes committee additionally new potential witnesses have been found that could open up the case in the real sense of the word  on 27 december 2009 serbian prosecutor vladimir vuk\u010devi\u0107 announced that the names of the people who were in the house were uncovered as well as victims from beyond kosovo some russian and czech citizens he further advised that organs were believed sold in the west and east in turkey and saudi arabia  on 9 september 2012 vuk\u010devi\u0107 said serbia is protecting an unnamed witness described as a former kla member who claims to have participated in harvesting a heart from a serb captive in northern albania and transporting it to the airport near tirana serbian prosecutors estimate that the information this witness has given is true  in june 2009 a kosovo serb and two serbian citizens accused of being provocateurs were arrested by the kosovo police for allegedly offering money in exchange for statements confirming organ trading and to mediators finding such information  the three have been investigated for inciting people to falsely testify that they were victims of organ harvesting  the accused were released in february 2010 and the case was dismissed by eulex  in may 2010 eulex chief war crimes investigator matti raatikainen said the fact is that there is no evidence whatsoever in this case no bodies no witnesses all the reports and media attention to this issue have not been helpful to us in fact they have not been helpful to anyone according to bbc news raatikainen said that the main problem was that the scandal created by the allegations has distracted attention from the real work of finding the remains of 1861 people still missing from the war and its aftermath and prosecuting their killers  in serbia kosovo and albania earlier that same month eulex made the first arrest in connection with a case of illegal detention camps in albania especially in the northeast albanian town of kukës which held ethnic albanians suspected of disloyalty to the kla but constant revelations in the serbian press that new evidence or new witnesses have emerged for the organtrafficking allegations have all proven either false or unsubstantiated according to bbc news one eulex investigator called it a fairytale a source close to the serbian investigation was also quoted as saying i still believe something happened there but nothing on the scale of what has been suggested and possibly not even connected to the kla  the european union has set up an investigation with a task force headed by us prosecutor john clint williamson although kosovo and albania continue to deny the accusations on 2 may 2012 albania drafted legislation allowing an euled investigation which would permit international investigators to conduct the probe on albanian territory  prime minister sali berisha stressed that for albania it is a priority to investigate allegations made by dick marty  first indications of williamsons report conclusions indicate that there is no basis for the allegations  in november 2008 several men were arrested after a raid on an organ trafficking ring in pristina after a turkish national dr yusuf sonmez was questioned by the kosovo police two urologists and a manager working in the private clinic medicus none of whom were qualified to perform surgery were conducting an organ trafficking business at their clinic from 1998 until their arrest in late 2008  sonmez is also believed to have been active in baku azerbaijan where a local investigation found citizens of various countries were brought into the country for illegal kidney transplants reportedly sonmez was involved in the alleged racket which also had operations in ecuador a group of four ukrainian doctors were arrested in this case by azeri and ukrainian authorities in addition sonmez who has admitted to performing thousands of transplants which he claims were all voluntary for humanitarian purposes has been repeatedly arrested for organ transplants in his native country  on 12 january 2011 yusuf sonmez dubbed dr frankenstein by turkish media was arrested in istanbul  in september 2011 a turkish prosecutor requested a 171year prison sentence for sonmez who was charged with performing at least 11 illegal organ removal surgeries at the medicus clinic illicit organ trafficking and forming a criminal gang the prosecutor demanded the same sentence for the accused mediator an israeli citizen moshe harel  in another case  five later nine people including the former kosovo government secretary of health were indicted on 15 october 2010 by an eulex court in pristina kosovo accused of direct or indirect involvement in a number of nonlethal illegal kidney transplantations at the medicus clinic the accused are said to have lured impoverished people from turkey russia moldova and kazakhstan with false promises of payment for their organs   according to the guardian the newspaper has established that organs are believed to have been shipped to istanbul in a criminal racket operated by yusuf sonmez the same turkish doctor wanted by interpol for his alleged involvement in the medicus clinic  on 12 december 2010 a draft  report from swiss prosecutor dick marty to the council of europe was prereleased  the report alleged that the republic of kosovos prime minister hashim thaçi was the head of a mafialike group responsible for smuggling weapons drugs and human organs through eastern europe  as stated in the report the kla held prisoners in a network of six facilities located in albania and thaçis drenica group had the greatest responsibility for the prisons and the fate of those held there  some serbians and some albanian kosovars were held prisoner in secret places of detention under kla control in northern albania and were subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment before ultimately disappearing the report says  a handful of the healthiest prisoners were presumably transferred to a farmhouse near fushëkrujë not far the albanian capital of tirana where they were killed for their kidneys  the report states as and when the transplant surgeons were confirmed to be in position and ready to operate the captives were brought out of the safe house individually summarily executed by a kla gunman and their corpses transported swiftly to the operating clinic some of the captives were aware of the fate that awaited them and pleaded not to be chopped up  the organs were then subsequently shipped to istanbul turkey  martys report entitled inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in kosovo was presented to the council of europe foreign relations committee on 16 december 2010 and was expected to be on the agenda of the session of council of europe in january 2011   the report made waves across the world and led to a series of similar reports   the swiss foreign ministry noted that martys report contained grave accusations made on the basis of countless witness accounts and evidence  the eulex announced that they regarded the report very seriously and called for supporting evidence  on 17 january 2011 the eulex special prosecutors office met with albanian officials to discuss the organ case  unmik chief lamberto zannier said that eulex which is now in charge of dealing with war crimes in kosovo was given every war crimes file that the icty and the un possessed including witness statements  kosovos government has denied the crimes and criticized the report as biased politically motivated and antialbanian speaking at a press conference marty claimed that the content of his report was known to western intelligence agencies who deliberately chose to downplay the allegations for the sake of foreignpolicy objectives  kosovo interim president jakup krasniqi asked the eu not to endorse the report saying i welcome your support in not allowing adoption of this report as an official document of the council of europe  former kosovo prime minister and kla commander currently social democrat leader agim çeku accused belgrade of creating the allegations saying every accusation against the kla comes from serbia or its helpers its just an attempt to blacken our war and our victory  albanian prime minister sali berisha responded by calling marty racist and antisemitic  while albanian mp shpëtim idrizi alleged that the report is something ordered by russia and serbia and offers no facts this is a story full of untruths and propaganda  on the other hand albanian former communistera dissident fatos lubonja said it is important for an investigation to be conducted it matters not only for international justice not only for the serbs it matters also for the kosovo albanians who have such leaders if these leaders are criminals if they face accusations of being criminals they cannot create a democratic order  hashim thaçi himself denied the crimes and his associates announced they would file a lawsuit against marty  thaçi also announced that he will publish a list of witnesses who contributed to the report that would discredit it stating there are witnesses and evidence which shows in what way the report was made thaçis political opponents denounced the report and the accusations as unacceptable  in 2011 marty retracted earlier comments and claimed that his report has never implicated thaçi directly but rather his close associates however he added that it is hard to believe that he thaçi never heard about that  on 25 january 2011 the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace voted to adopt a resolution based on the marty report 166 pace members voted in favor while eight voted against the document several amendments proposed by the albanian delegation were rejected and the council called for a full and serious investigation  the resolution calls on the international community and governments in belgrade and pri\u0161tina as well as in albania to undertake measures in order to clear up the crimes  on 8 february 2011 the wall street journal published an article by denis macshane questioning the allegations in martys report according to a former prosecutor in the case against slobodan milosevic sir geoffrey nice the marty report provides no evidence no victims and a witness that does not exist nice dismissed the allegations as attempts to undermine kosovos independence  in march 2011 marty presented his report to the european parliaments committee on foreign affairs whose members said after the meeting that marty did not provide any evidence while some of them claimed that he attacked and accused of bias those who questioned his report in a heated debate marty told the meps that a witness protection program was needed in kosovo before he could provide more details on witnesses to the trafficking as their lives were in danger  in january 2011 the guardian released nato documents from 2004 that identified hashim thaçi as under the control of the albanian mafia in particular former kla chief of logistics xhavit haliti haliti who serves as a political and financial adviser to the prime minister was described as highly involved in prostitution weapons and drugs smuggling  according to the article haliti uses fake passports to travel abroad because he is blacklisted in several countries including the united states haliti is also named in the report by marty which is understood to have drawn on nato intelligence assessments along with reports from the fbi and mi5 according to the article  on 17 february 2011 the media obtained a classified document  which suggests that the un knew about the organ trafficking and the criminal involvement of senior kla commanders as early as 2003 on 20 february 2011 jose pablo baraybar former unmik forensics and missing persons office head confirmed that the united nations was given confidential material about organ trafficking in kosovo by an anonymous official  the statements compiled in 30pages were made to the un by at least eight low to midlevel ranking kla members  the documents have been given the name cx103  head of the icty mission to skopje and pri\u0161tina eamon smith sent a letter to the icty chief investigator patrick lopez terez on 30 october 2003 informing lopez about smiths meeting and conversation with unmik justice department head paul e coffey smith presented his conclusions regarding the human organ trafficking case based on testimony by former kla members in 20022003  a number of exkla ethnic albanian witnesses from kosovo and montenegro gave detailed testimony about the revenge killings of serbs and trading of kidneys livers and other organs in the aftermath of the kosovo war taking place as late as the summer of 2000  the witnesses reported that between 100 and 300 people were kidnapped in mid1999 and transported to detention facilities in northern albania where they were held some of the captives in the 2550 year age range were subjected to medical exams at given locations the witnesses described how they buried victims to hide evidence of killings the un briefly investigated the claims but did not launch the probe prompting accusations of double standards against the un by serbia  most of the victims were serbs who were abducted in kosovo between june and october 1999 the document stated  those people were allegedly held at different klarun prisons in albania and in some cases their organs were removed at a home set up as a medical clinic where specialized equipment and medical personnel were in place to carry out the operations  in december 2003 a top justice official in kosovo paul coffey wrote to jonathan sutch an icty official in kosovo that the crimes were reported to the un in kosovo by multiple sources of unknown reliability coffey said the information was based on interviews with at least eight sources the credibility of whom is untested all ethnic albanians from kosovo or montenegro who served in the kla   one of the witnesses is quoted as telling the un that the first two organ harvesting surgeries were done to breach the market and that traffickers later were able to make up to 45000 per body the largest shipment was when they did 5 serbs together  he said they took a fortune that time other shipments were usually from two or three serbs according to the document  a source said that the organs were taken through tiranas international airport nënë tereza to the atatürk international airport in istanbul and that workers at the airports were bribed to close their eyes two sources said they personally took part in delivering body parts hearts lungs livers kidneys to tiranas international airport one source said he was instructed by his kla superiors not to mistreat the prisoners and that he became suspicious when they were to deliver a briefcase or a file with papers that would be given to the doctor when the captives were delivered to the house in northern albania adding that he used to bring prisoners there but never drove any of them back  witnesses state that top kla members and doctors from kosovo and abroad were fully aware of the transport and surgeries and that they were actively involved in them  the sources also told the un that the house where the organs were harvested was a twohour drive from tirana airport  the un and icty investigators visited a house in the village of rripë in 2004 and found pieces of medical equipment medicine boxes and blood traces  other victims include some women described as prostitutes of whom at least two were believed abducted in albania  in spring 2011 the eu rule of law mission in kosovo eulex with the full support of all 27 eu member states decided to set up a special investigative task force with the view to further the investigation into the allegations contained in the council of europe report of dick marty  in april 2013 an euled court in kosovo found five people guilty in connection with a human organtrafficking ring at the medicus clinic in pristina the found that the medicus clinic recruited poor people from across eastern europe and central asia promising them 15000 euro for their organs the trade was discovered when a turkish man collapsed after having one of his kidneys removed at the clinic the clinics director urologist lutfi dervishi was sentenced to eight years in prison for organised crime and human trafficking his son arban was sentenced to seven years and three months while three other defendants received between one and three years imprisonment meanwhile two former government officials also charged in the case have been cleared of involvement  in july 2014 clint williamson the lead prosecutor with the task force told a press conference in brussels that unnamed senior officials of the former kosovo liberation army will face indictments for crimes against humanity and other abuses he said there were compelling indications that a few individuals were killed with the intention of extracting their organs by kla fighters but the allegations that hundreds of prisoners were killed and their organs sold was totally unsupported  on april 4 2014 media reported eu plans to start in 2015 a tribunal costing 170m and funded by the eu that will try albanians involved in the organ traffic  the us ambassador to kosovo tracey ann jacobson said that the proposed establishment of a special tribunal to deal with allegations of organ trafficking by former kosovo albanian rebels would help kosovo build up its international credibility  press reports suggested that the eu and the government of kosovo have yet to reach an agreement for the establishment of the tribunal the kosovan authorities insist on a domestic court staffed by local judges  eulex chief bernd borchardt in june 2014 said that the special court is supposed to work in accordance with kosovar law to the extent this is applicable this court will not only have a seat in kosovo but also outside the country in particular to make witness statements easier

V pepsin is an enzyme whose zymogen pepsinogen is released by the chief cells in the stomach and that degrades food proteins into peptides it was discovered in 1836 by theodor schwann who also coined its name from the greek word \u03c0\u03ad\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 pepsis meaning digestion from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd peptein to digest     it was one of the first enzymes to be discovered and in 1928 it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized by john h northrop  pepsin is a digestive protease a member of the aspartate protease family  pepsin is one of three principal proteindegrading or proteolytic enzymes in the digestive system the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin the three enzymes were among the first to be isolated in crystalline form during the process of digestion these enzymes each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components ie peptides and amino acids which can be readily absorbed by the intestinal lining pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine    the term pepsin was first coined by theodor schwann in the early 19th century scientists around this time began discovering many biochemical compounds that play a significant role in biological processes and pepsin was one of them this acidic substance that was able to convert nitrogen based foods into watersoluble material was determined to be pepsin  pepsin is expressed as a proform zymogen pepsinogen whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids in the stomach chief cells release pepsinogen this zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid hcl which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining the hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and hcl from the stomach lining when food is ingested hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion thereby generating pepsin the active form pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin pepsin is most active in acidic environments between 37c and 42c   accordingly its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach ph 15 to 2 pepsin will digest up to 20 of ingested amide bonds by cleaving preferentially after the nterminal   of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine   pepsin exhibits preferential cleavage for hydrophobic preferably aromatic residues in p1 and p1 positions increased susceptibility to hydrolysis occurs if there is a sulfurcontaining amino acid close to the peptide bond which has an aromatic amino acid pepsin cleaves phe val gln his glu ala ala leu leu tyr tyr leu gly phe phe  pepsin exhibits maximal activity at ph 20 and is inactive at ph 65 and above however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until ph 80  therefore pepsin in solution of up to ph 80 can be reactivated upon reacidification the stability of pepsin at high ph has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event   at the mean ph of the laryngopharynx ph  68 pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux   pepsin remains in the larynx ph 68 following a gastric reflux event   while enzymatically inactive in this environment pepsin would remain stable and could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events  exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage    pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or nonacid gastric reflux weak or nonacid reflux is correlated with reflux symptoms and mucosal injury     under nonacid conditions neutral ph pepsin is internalized by cells of the upper airways such as the larynx and hypopharynx by a process known as receptormediated endocytosis  the receptor by which pepsin is endocytosed is currently unknown upon cellular uptake pepsin is stored in intracellular vesicles of low ph at which its enzymatic activity would be restored pepsin is retained within the cell for up to 24 hours  such exposure to pepsin at neutral ph and endoyctosis of pepsin causes changes in gene expression associated with inflammation which underlies signs and symptoms of reflux  and tumor progression  this and other research  implicates pepsin in carcinogenesis attributed to gastric reflux pepsin in airway specimens is considered to be a sensitive and specific marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux   research to develop new pepsintargeted therapeutic and diagnostic tools for gastric reflux is ongoing a rapid noninvasive pepsin diagnostic called peptest is now available which determines the presence of pepsin in saliva samples  pepsins should be stored at very low temperatures between 80c and 20c to prevent autolysis selfdigestion pepsin may be inhibited by high ph see activity and stability above or by inhibitor compounds pepstatin is a low molecular weight compound and potent inhibitor specific for acid proteases with a ki of about 10  m for pepsin the statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases pepstatin does not covalently bind pepsin and inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin is therefore reversible  1bisdiazoacetyl2penylethane reversibly inactivates pepsin at ph 5 a reaction which is accelerated by the presence of cuii  pepsin also undergoes feedback inhibition a product of protein digestion slows down the reaction by inhibiting pepsin   sucralfate also inhibits pepsin activity commercial pepsin is extracted from the glandular layer of hog stomachs it is a component of rennet used to curdle milk during the manufacture of cheese pepsin is used for a variety of applications in food manufacturing to modify and provide whipping qualities to soy protein and gelatin  to modify vegetable proteins for use in nondairy snack items to make precooked cereals into instant hot cereals  and to prepare animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates for use in flavoring foods and beverages it is used in the leather industry to remove hair and residual tissue from hides and in the recovery of silver from discarded photographic films by digesting the gelatin layer that holds the silver  pepsin was historically an additive of beemans gum brand chewing gum by dr edward e beeman it also gave name to pepsicola originally formulated with pepsin and kola nuts pepsin is commonly used in the preparation of fab2 fragments from antibodies in some assays it is preferable to use only the antigenbinding fab portion of the antibody for these applications antibodies may be enzymatically digested to produce either an fab or an fab2 fragment of the antibody to produce an fab2 fragment igg is digested with pepsin which cleaves the heavy chains near the hinge region one or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved so the two fab regions of the antibody remain joined together yielding a divalent molecule containing two antibody binding sites hence the designation fab2 the light chains remain intact and attached to the heavy chain the fc fragment is digested into small peptides fab fragments are generated by cleavage of igg with papain instead of pepsin papain cleaves igg above the hinge region containing the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains but below the site of the disulfide bond between the light chain and heavy chain this generates two separate monovalent containing a single antibody binding site fab fragments and an intact fc fragment the fragments can be purified by gel filtration ion exchange or affinity chromatography  fab and fab2 antibody fragments are used in assay systems where the presence of the fc region may cause problems in tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen or in peripheral blood preparations cells with fc receptors macrophages monocytes b lymphocytes and natural killer cells are present which can bind the fc region of intact antibodies causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen use of fab2 or fab fragments ensures that the antibodies are binding to the antigen and not fc receptors these fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma because they are not able to bind complement which could lyse the cells fab2 and to a greater extent fab fragments allow more exact localization of the target antigen ie in staining tissue for electron microscopy the divalency of the fab2 fragment enables it to crosslink antigens allowing use for precipitation assays cellular aggregation via surface antigens or rosetting assays  the following three genes encode identical human pepsinogen a enzymes a fourth human gene encodes

V 2ckt 2pmv 3kq4 intrinsic factor if also known as gastric intrinsic factor gif is a glycoprotein produced by the parietal cells of the stomach it is necessary for the absorption of vitamin b12 cobalamin later on in the small intestine  in humans the gastric intrinsic factor protein is encoded by the gif gene  haptocorrin also known as hc r protein and transcobalamin i tcn1 is a glycoprotein secreted by the salivary glands which binds to vitamin b12 vitamin b12 is acid sensitive and in binding to transcobalamin i it can safely pass through the acidic stomach to the duodenum here in the less acidic environment of the small intestine pancreatic enzymes digest the glycoprotein carrier and vitamin b12 can then bind to intrinsic factor this new complex is then absorbed by the epithelial cells enterocytes of the ileum inside the cells b12 dissociates once again and binds to another protein transcobalamin ii tcn2 the new complex can then exit the epithelial cells to be carried to the liver   the intrinsic factor is secreted by the stomach it is present in the gastric juice as well as in the gastric mucous membrane the optimum ph for its action is 7 and it is inactivated at temperatures above 45c it does not necessarily run parallel with the amount of hcl or pepsin in the gastric juice so in some cases the intrinsic factor may be present even if there is no hcl or pepsin or vice versa the site of formation of the intrinsic factor varies in different species in pigs it is obtained from the pylorus and beginning of the duodenum in human beings it is present in the fundus and body of the stomach the limited amount of normal human gastric intrinsic factor limits normal efficient absorption of b12 to about 2 mcg per meal a nominally adequate intake of b12  in pernicious anemia which is usually an autoimmune disease autoantibodies directed against intrinsic factor or parietal cells themselves lead to an intrinsic factor deficiency malabsorption of vitamin b12 and subsequent megaloblastic anemia atrophic gastritis can also cause intrinsic factor deficiency and anemia through damage to the parietal cells of the stomach wall pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can interfere with normal dissociation of vitamin b12 from its binding proteins in the small intestine preventing its absorption via the intrinsic factor complex other risk factors contributing to pernicious anemia are anything that damages or removes a portion of the stomachs parietal cells including bariatric surgery gastric tumors gastric ulcers and excessive consumption of alcohol patients experiencing an insufficiency in their intrinsic factor levels cannot benefit from a low dose oral vitamin b12 supplement because it will not absorb through the wall of the small intestine however sublingual b12 supplements overcome this problem  historically the disease was thought untreatable before the discovery that it could be managed with daily uptake of 300g raw liver pulp  unlike other watersoluble vitamins vitamin b12 is stored in the liver today synthetic vitamin b12 can be injected monthly thus bypassing the digestive tract altogether although if is necessary for efficient absorption of b12 even without intrinsic factor the intestines can directly absorb about 1 of ingested b12 oral supplement of 5001000 mcg readily available otc per day provides adequate direct absorption without functioning intrinsic factor

V a grid cell is a type of neuron in the brains of many species that allows them to understand their position in space       grid cells were discovered in 2005 by edvard moser maybritt moser and their students torkel hafting marianne fyhn and sturla molden at the centre for the biology of memory cbm in norway they were awarded the 2014 nobel prize in physiology or medicine together with john okeefe for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain the arrangement of spatial firing fields all at equal distances from their neighbors led to a hypothesis that these cells encode a cognitive representation of euclidean space  the discovery also suggested a mechanism for dynamic computation of selfposition based on continuously updated information about position and direction in a typical experimental study an electrode capable of recording the activity of an individual neuron is implanted in the cerebral cortex of a rat in a section called the dorsomedial entorhinal cortex and recordings are made as the rat moves around freely in an open arena for a grid cell if a dot is placed at the location of the rats head every time the neuron emits an action potential then as illustrated in the adjoining figure these dots build up over time to form a set of small clusters and the clusters form the vertices of a grid of equilateral triangles this regular trianglepattern is what distinguishes grid cells from other types of cells that show spatial firing by contrast if a place cell from the rat hippocampus is examined in the same way ie by placing a dot at the location of the rats head whenever the cell emits an action potential then the dots build up to form small clusters but frequently there is only one cluster one place field in a given environment and even when multiple clusters are seen there is no perceptible regularity in their arrangement   in 1971 john okeefe and jonathon dostrovsky reported the discovery of place cells in the rat hippocampus  cells that fire action potentials when an animal passes through a specific small region of space which is called the place field of the cell  this discovery although controversial at first led to a series of investigations that culminated in the 1978 publication of a book by okeefe and his colleague lynn nadel called the hippocampus as a cognitive map   the book argued that the hippocampal neural network instantiates cognitive maps as hypothesized by the psychologist edward c tolman this theory aroused a great deal of interest and motivated hundreds of experimental studies aimed at clarifying the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory and spatial navigation because the entorhinal cortex provides by far the largest input to the hippocampus it was clearly important to understand the spatial firing properties of entorhinal neurons the earliest studies such as quirk et al 1992 described neurons in the entorhinal cortex as having relatively large and fuzzy place fields  the mosers however thought it was possible that a different result would be obtained if recordings were made from a different part of the entorhinal cortex the entorhinal cortex is a strip of tissue running along the back edge of the rat brain from the ventral to the dorsal sides anatomical studies had shown that different sectors of the entorhinal cortex project to different levels of the hippocampus the dorsal end of the ec projects to the dorsal hippocampus the ventral end to the ventral hippocampus  this was relevant because several studies had shown that place cells in the dorsal hippocampus have considerably sharper place fields than cells from more ventral levels  every study of entorhinal spatial activity prior to 2004 however had made use of electrodes implanted near the ventral end of the ec accordingly together with marianne fyhn sturla molden and menno witter the mosers set out to examine spatial firing from the different dorsaltoventral levels of the entorhinal cortex they found that in the dorsal part of medial entorhinal cortex mec cells had sharply defined place fields like in the hippocampus but the cells fired at multiple locations  the arrangement of the firing fields showed hints of regularity but the size of the environment was too small for spatial periodicity to be visible in this study the next set of experiments reported in 2005 made use of a larger environment which led to the recognition that the cells were actually firing in a hexagonal grid pattern  the study showed that cells at similar dorsaltoventral mec levels had similar grid spacing and grid orientation but the phase of the grid the offset of the grid vertices relative to the x and y axes appeared to be randomly distributed between cells the periodic firing pattern was expressed independently of the configuration of landmarks in darkness as well as in the presence of visible landmarks and independently of changes in the animals speed and direction leading the authors to suggest that grid cells expressed a pathintegration dependent dynamic computation of the animals location in 2014 john okeefe maybritt moser and edvard moser were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries of grid cells grid cells are neurons that fire when a freely moving animal traverses a set of small regions firing fields which are roughly equal in size and arranged in a periodic triangular array that covers the entire available environment  cells with this firing pattern have been found in all layers of the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex dmec but cells in different layers tend to differ in other respects layer ii contains the largest density of pure grid cells in the sense that they fire equally regardless of the direction in which an animal traverses a grid location grid cells from deeper layers are intermingled with conjunctive cells  and head direction cells ie in layers iii v and vi there are cells with a gridlike pattern that fire only when the animal is facing a particular direction  grid cells that lie next to one another ie cells recorded from the same electrode usually show the same grid spacing and orientation but their grid vertices are displaced from one another by apparently random offsets cells recorded from separate electrodes at a distance from one another however frequently show different grid spacings cells that are located more ventrally that is farther from the dorsal border of the mec generally have larger firing fields at each grid vertex and correspondingly greater spacing between the grid vertices  the total range of grid spacings is not well established the initial report described a roughly twofold range of grid spacings from 39cm to 73cm across the dorsalmost part upper 25 of the mec  but there are indications of considerably larger grid scales in more ventral zones brun et al 2008 recorded grid cells from multiple levels in rats running along an 18 meter track and found that the grid spacing expanded from about 25cm in their dorsalmost sites to about 3 m at the ventralmost sites  these recordings only extended 34 of the way to the ventral tip so it is possible that even larger grids exist grid cell activity does not require visual input since grid patterns remain unchanged when all the lights in an environment are turned off  when visual cues are present however they exert strong control over the alignment of the grids rotating a cue card on the wall of a cylinder causes grid patterns to rotate by the same amount  grid patterns appear on the first entrance of an animal into a novel environment and usually remain stable thereafter  when an animal is moved into a completely different environment grid cells maintain their grid spacing and the grids of neighboring cells maintain their relative offsets  when a rat is moved to a different environment the spatial activity patterns of hippocampal place cells usually show complete remapping  that is the pattern of place fields reorganizes in a way that bears no detectable resemblance to the pattern in the original environment muller and kubie 1987  if the features of an environment are altered less radically however the place field pattern may show a lesser degree of change referred to as rate remapping in which many cells alter their firing rates but the majority of cells retain place fields in the same locations as before fyhn et al 2007 examined this phenomenon using simultaneous recordings of hippocampal and entorhinal cells and found that in situations where the hippocampus shows rate remapping grid cells show unaltered firing patterns whereas when the hippocampus shows complete remapping grid cell firing patterns show unpredictable shifts and rotations  neural activity in nearly every part of the hippocampal system is modulated by the limbic theta rhythm which has a frequency range of about 69hz in rats the entorhinal cortex is no exception like the hippocampus it receives cholinergic and gabaergic input from the medial septal area the central controller of theta grid cells like hippocampal place cells show strong theta modulation  grid cells from layer ii of the mec also resemble hippocampal place cells in that they show phase precessionthat is their spike activity advances from late to early phases of the theta cycle as an animal passes through a grid vertex most grid cells from layer iii do not precess but their spike activity is largely confined to half of the theta cycle the grid cell phase precession is not derived from the hippocampus because it continues to appear in animals whose hippocampus has been inactivated by an agonist of gaba  many species of mammals can keep track of spatial location even in the absence of visual auditory olfactory or tactile cues by integrating their movementsthe ability to do this is referred to in the literature as path integration a number of theoretical models have explored mechanisms by which path integration could be performed by neural networks in most models such as those of samsonovich and mcnaughton 1997  or burak and fiete 2009  the principal ingredients are 1 an internal representation of position 2 internal representations of the speed and direction of movement and 3 a mechanism for shifting the encoded position by the right amount when the animal moves because cells in the mec encode information about position grid cells  and movement head direction cells and conjunctive positionbydirection cells  this area is currently viewed as the most promising candidate for the place in the brain where path integration occurs however the question remains unresolved as in humans the entorhinal cortex does not appear to be required for path integration  burak and fiete 2009 showed that a computational simulation of the grid cell system was capable of performing path integration to a high level of accuracy  however more recent theoretical work has suggested that grid cells might perform a more general denoising process not necessarily related to spatial processing  hafting et al 2005 suggested that a place code is computed in the entorhinal cortex and fed into the hippocampus which may make the associations between place and events that are needed for the formation of memories in contrast to a hippocampal place cell a grid cell has multiple firing fields with regular spacing which tessellate the environment in a hexagonal pattern the unique properties of grid cells are as follows the grid cells are anchored to external landmarks but persist in darkness suggesting that grid cells may be part of a selfmotion based map of the spatial environment

V the sugiura procedure is a surgical technique that involves the removal and transection of the blood vessels that supply the upper portion of the stomach and the esophagus the procedure also involves a splenectomy the operation was originally developed to treat bleeding esophageal varices commonly a complication of liver cirrhosis that were untreatable by other conventional methods it was originally developed as a twostep operation but has been modified numerous times by many surgeons since its original creation   the sugiura procedure was originally developed to treat bleeding esophageal varices and consisted mainly of an esophagogastric devascularization it was developed in japan in 1973  as a nonshunting technique that achieved variceal bleeding hemostasis by interrupting the variceal blood flow along the gastroesophageal junction the procedure consists primarily of paraesophagogastric devascularization achieved by dividing the perforating veins of the esophagus and the stomach while maintaining the plexus of collaterals that connect the coronary gastric vein to the azygous system the original procedure also consisted of an esophageal transection splenectomy vagotomy and pyloroplasty the sugiura procedure was originally associated with significant morbidity and mortality in recent years though this procedure and its modifications have been performed in many hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgical centers with improving morbidity and mortality rates        the modified sugiura procedure is indicated in patients with wellpreserved liver function childpugh class a or b without chronic ascites and who are not candidates for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt distal splenorenal shunt or liver transplantation   emergency sugiura procedure is indicated when childpugh class a or b cirrhotic patients are acutely bleeding from gastroesophageal varices that are not responsive to medical or radiological therapies  a study of 15 children aged 212 years old who all had multiple episodes of severe esophageal bleeding varices and a mean followup time of 10 years 4 months demonstrated 0 mortality and 80 resolution with disappearance of the varices and no evidence of recurrent bleeding no cases of esophageal stenosis gastroesophageal reflux disease hiatal hernia encephalopathy or hepatic dysfunction were documented the sugiura procedure is a safe and effective surgical treatment of esophageal varices in the pediatric population  the original technique described by sugiura and futagawa was a twostep operation consisting of an initial thoracic operation followed by the abdominal operation 34 weeks later the thoracic operation consists of an extensive paraesophageal devascularization up to the inferior pulmonary vein and esophageal transection the abdominal operation consists of a splenectomy devascularization of the abdominal esophagus and cardia and a selective vagotomy with pyloroplasty  access is gained through a left lateral thoracotomy incision below the sixth rib the inferior mediastinum is exposed to the level of the anterior aspect of the descending aorta all of the shunting veins that direct blood to the collateral veins from the esophagus are ligated taking special consideration to preserving the extraesophageal systemic venous collaterals azygous veins usually between 3050 shunting veins are present once devascularization is complete the esophagus is clamped in two areas with esophageal clamps and esophageal transection is done at the level of the diaphragm the anterior muscular and mucosal layers are divided but the posterior layer is left intact sutures are then placed and the divided varices are occluded the muscle layer is then reattached a nasogastric tube is left in situ and the mediastinum is closed access is gained through an upper midline incision with left lateral extension splenectomy is then performed the abdominal esophagus is devascularized from the stomach the posterior gastric vagus nerve requires ligation due to its close proximity the lesser curvature of the stomach and abdominal esophagus are then devascularized and the cardioesophageal branches of the left gastric vessels are ligated and divided the esophagus and cardia are then entirely mobilized the anterior gastric vagus nerve was previously divided and therefore pyloroplasty is performed a drain is inserted in the surgical cavity and the incision is closed since the majority of documented sugiura procedures performed outside japan failed to achieve the exceptionally low mortality and morbidity rates various authors have proposed modifications to make the procedure less complex      one common modification uses a single abdominal operation to achieve gastroesophageal devascularization a splenectomy is initially performed and is followed by devascularization of the distal esophagus through the diaphragm hiatus and the superior twothirds of the major and lesser gastric curve taking careful consideration to not ligate the left gastric vein to ensure complete separation of the azygous vein system from the intramucosal venous plexus an endtoend anastomosing stapling device transects and anastomosis a region of the esophagus 46cm above the gastroesophageal junction this anastomosis can then be reinforced with vicryl suture a pyloroplasty is routinely followed to facilitate gastric emptying  early experience with the sugiura procedure demonstrated following the procedures the overall operative mortality was 32 and overall morbidity occurred in 33 of the patients  significant causes of morbidity and mortality were related to complications of the esophageal transection as anastomotic leakage occurred in 86 of patients undergoing emergent surgery versus 48 in elective cases all patients who developed an esophageal leak died  for this reason modification of the original procedure was introduced to avoid the risk of perioperative mortality due to esophageal transection retrospective analyses of patients who received the sugiura procedure between 1967 and 1984 for either elective emergency or prophylactic setting demonstrate that operative mortality was greatest in the emergency setting 133 followed by prophylactic 39 and elective surgery 30  recent reports of selected patients undergoing sugiura procedure reported that recurrence of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding occurs in only 23 of patients

V nipple stimulation or breast stimulation is a common human sexual practice either by itself or as part of other sexual activities the practice may be performed upon or by people of any gender or sexual orientation adult women and men report that breast stimulation may be used to both initiate and enhance sexual arousal  the male or female breast nipple and areola develop similarly in the fetus and during infancy at puberty the males breasts remain rudimentary but the females develop further mainly due to the presence of estrogen and progesterone and become more sensitive all breasts have the same number of nerve endings no matter how large they are accordingly smaller breasts are more sensitive while larger breasts may require more forceful stimulation  breasts and especially the nipples are highly erogenous zones for both men and women and have a heightened sensitivity the stimulation of which may produce sexual excitement erect nipples can be a prominent indicator of a females sexual arousal and the females sexual partner may as a result find this erotically stimulating the stimulation of womens nipples promotes the production and release of oxytocin and prolactin  during the stimulation of the nipples large amounts of oxytocin are released which would normally prepare womens breasts for breastfeeding besides creating maternal feelings it also decreases a womans anxiety and increases feelings of bonding and trust   the release of oxytocin in a womans body can lead to sexual arousal with a resulting physiological response including the erection of the nipples  nipple erection is due to the contraction of smooth muscle under the control of the autonomic nervous system and is a product of the pilomotor reflex which causes goose bumps nipple erection can also be caused by a mild tactile stimulation or as a response to cold temperature in both males and females  nipple erection may also result during sexual arousal in females and males or during breastfeeding both are caused by the release of oxytocin an erection of the nipples makes them even more sensitive to the touch some women can achieve an orgasm as a result of nipple stimulation a survey in 2006 has found that sexual arousal in about 82 of young females and 52 of young males arises or is enhanced by direct stimulation of nipples with only 78 reporting that it decreased their arousal   a 2011 study using magnetic resonance imaging has shown that the area of the sensory cortex in a womans brain associated with the genitals is aroused by stimulating her nipples the same brain areas connected to genitals were aroused as well in men who stimulated their nipples  prolactin produces sexual gratification after sexual activity prolactin represses the effect of dopamine which is responsible for sexual arousal  and is thought to cause the sexual refractory period following orgasm during which the individual typically a male does not desire any further sexual stimulation

V a retinal implant is a biomedical implant technology currently being developed by a number of private companies and research institutions worldwide the implant is meant to partially restore useful vision to people who have lost their vision due to degenerative eye conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa rp or macular degeneration there are three types of retinal implants currently in clinical trials epiretinal implants on the retina subretinal implants behind the retina and suprachoroidal implants above the vascular choroid retinal implants provide the user with low resolution images by electrically stimulating surviving retinal cells such images may be sufficient for restoring specific visual abilities such as light perception and object recognition   foerster was the first to discover that electrical stimulation of the occipital cortex could be used to create visual percepts phosphenes  the first application of an implantable stimulator for vision restoration was developed by drs brindley and lewin in 1968  this experiment demonstrated the viability of creating visual percepts using direct electrical stimulation and it motivated the development of several other implantable devices for stimulation of the visual pathway including retinal implants  retinal stimulation devices in particular have become a focus of research as approximately half of all cases of blindness are caused by retinal damage  the development of retinal implants has also been motivated in part by the advancement and success of cochlear implants which has demonstrated that humans can regain significant sensory function with limited input  the argus ii retinal implant manufactured by second sight medical products received market approval in the usa in feb 2013 and in europe in feb 2011 becoming the first approved implant  the device may help adults with rp who have lost the ability to perceive shapes and movement to be more mobile and to perform daytoday activities the epiretinal device is known as the retina implant and was originally developed in germany by retina implant ag it completed a multicentre clinical trial in europe and was awarded a ce mark in 2013 making it the first wireless epiretinal device to gain approval optimal candidates for retinal implants have retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa or agerelated macular degeneration these diseases cause blindness by affecting the photoreceptor cells in the outer layer of the retina while leaving the inner and middle retinal layers intact       minimally a patient must have an intact ganglion cell layer in order to be a candidate for a retinal implant this can be assessed noninvasively using optical coherence tomography oct imaging  other factors including the amount of residual vision overall health and family commitment to rehabilitation are also considered when determining candidates for retinal implants in subjects with agerelated macular degeneration who may have intact peripheral vision retinal implants could result in a hybrid form of vision in this case the implant would supplement the remaining peripheral vision with central vision information  there are two main types of retinal implants epiretinal implants are placed in the internal surface of the retina while subretinal implants are placed between the outer retinal layer and the retinal pigment epithelium epiretinal implants sit in the inner surface of the retina directly stimulating ganglion cells and bypassing all other retinal layers epiretinal implants consist of a silicon platinum electrode array mounted onto the inner retinal layer the array is stabilized using micro tacks along with the slight mechanical pressure provided by the vitreous humour the epiretinal implant requires an external video camera to acquire images  the camera receives an image of the surrounding environment processes the image and communicates the image information to the implanted electrode array wirelessly via telemetry an external transmitter is also required to provide continuous power to the implant via radiofrequency induction coils or infrared lasers the external camera and image processing chip are generally mounted onto eyeglasses for the patient  the image processing involves reducing the resolution of the image and converting the image into a spatial and temporal pattern of stimulation to activate the appropriate retinal cells   the epiretinal implant system must be capable of processing images in real time to prevent any noticeable delays between the camera input and retinal stimulation which could confound visual perception the processing chip may also need to perform additional functions such as motion and edge detection  epiretinal implants are advantageous as they bypass a large portion of the retina relying on the function of ganglion cells in the innermost layer of the retina therefore epiretinal implants could provide visual perception to individuals with retinal diseases extending beyond the photoreceptor layer the majority of electronics can be incorporated into the associated external components allowing for a smaller implant and simpler upgrades without additional surgery  the external electronics also allow a doctor to have full control over the image processing and adapt the processing for each patient  additionally the location of epiretinal implants allows the vitreous humor to serve as a heat sink for the implant  the main disadvantage of epiretinal implants is the need for an external apparatus which can be cumbersome to wear the external camera also requires a subject to make head movements in order to change their gaze epiretinal implants can stimulate not only ganglion cell bodies but also the nearby axons which may be associated with other retinotopic areas this can result in a slightly distorted stimulation pattern which must be corrected during electronic processing  additionally stimulation at the ganglion cell layer requires more sophisticated image processing techniques in order to account for the normal processing associated with the bypassed retinal layers  while an epiretinal implant can be stabilized by the pressure of the vitreous humour mechanical fixation using microtacks may be required to further stabilize the implant onto the inner retinal layer   the first epiretinal implant the argus device included a silicon platinum array with 16 electrodes  the phase i clinical trial of argus began in 2002 by implanting six participants with the device all patients reported gaining a perception of light and discrete phosphenes with the visual function of some patients improving significantly over time future versions of the argus device are being developed with increasingly dense electrode arrays allowing for improved spatial resolution the most recent argus ii device contains 60 electrodes and a 200 electrode device is under development by ophthalmologists and engineers at the usc eye institute  the argus ii device received marketing approval in february 2011 ce mark demonstrating safety and performance and it is available in germany france italy and uk interim results on 30 patients long term trials were published in ophthalmology in 2012 argus ii received approval from the us fda on april 14 2013 fda approval another epiretinal device the learning retinal implant has been developed by iip technologies gmbh and has begun to be evaluated in clinical trials  a third epiretinal device epiret has been developed and progressed to clinical testing in six patients the epiret device contains 25 electrodes and requires the crystalline lens to be replaced with a receiver chip all subjects have demonstrated the ability to discriminate between different spatial and temporal patterns of stimulation  subretinal implants sit on the outer surface of the retina between the photoreceptor layer and the retinal pigment epithelium directly stimulating retinal cells and relying on the normal processing of the inner and middle retinal layers  adhering a subretinal implant in place is relatively simple as the implant is mechanically constrained by the minimal distance between the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium a subretinal implant consists of a silicon wafer containing light sensitive microphotodiodes which generate signals directly from the incoming light incident light passing through the retina generates currents within the microphotodiodes which directly inject the resultant current into the underlying retinal cells via arrays of microelectrodes the pattern of microphotodiodes activated by incident light therefore stimulates a pattern of bipolar horizontal amacrine and ganglion cells leading to a visual perception representative of the original incident image in principle subretinal implants do not require any external hardware beyond the implanted microphotodiodes array however some subretinal implants require power from external circuitry to enhance the image signal  a subretinal implant is advantageous over an epiretinal implant in part because of its simpler design the light acquisition processing and stimulation are all carried out by microphotodiodes mounted onto a single chip as opposed to the external camera processing chip and implanted electrode array associated with an epiretinal implant  the subretinal placement is also more straightforward as it places the stimulating array directly adjacent to the damaged photoreceptors   by relying on the function of the remaining retinal layers subretinal implants allow for normal inner retinal processing including amplification thus resulting in an overall lower threshold for a visual response  additionally subretinal implants enable subjects to use normal eye movements to shift their gaze the retinotopic stimulation from subretinal implants is inherently more accurate as the pattern of incident light on the microphotodiodes is a direct reflection of the desired image subretinal implants require minimal fixation as the subretinal space is mechanically constrained and the retinal pigment epithelium creates negative pressure within the subretinal space  the main disadvantage of subretinal implants is the lack of sufficient incident light to enable the microphotodiodes to generate adequate current thus subretinal implants often incorporate an external power source to amplify the effect of incident light  the compact nature of the subretinal space imposes significant size constraints on the implant the close proximity between the implant and the retina also increases the possibility of thermal damage to the retina from heat generated by the implant  subretinal implants require intact inner and middle retinal layers and therefore are not beneficial for retinal diseases extending beyond the outer photoreceptor layer additionally photoreceptor loss can result in the formation of a membrane at the boundary of the damaged photoreceptors which can impede stimulation and increase the stimulation threshold  optobionics was the first company to develop a subretinal implant and evaluate the design in a clinical trial initial reports indicated that the implantation procedure was safe and all subjects reported some perception of light and mild improvement in visual function  the current version of this device has been implanted in 10 patients who have each reported improvements in the perception of visual details including contrast shape and movement  retina implant ag in germany has also developed a subretinal implant which has undergone clinical testing in nine patients trial was put on hold due to repeated failures  the retina implant ag device contains 1500 microphotodiodes allowing for increased spatial resolution but requires an external power source retina implant ag reported 12 months results on the alpha ims study in feb 2013 showing that six out of nine patients had a device failure in the nine months post implant proceedings of the royal society b and that five of the eight subjects reported various implantmediated visual perceptions in daily life one had optic nerve damage and did not perceive stimulation the boston subretinal implant project has also developed several iterations of a functional subretinal implant and focused on short term analysis of implant function  results from all clinical trials to date indicate that patients receiving subretinal implants report perception of phosphenes with some gaining the ability to perform basic visual tasks such as shape recognition and motion detection  the quality of vision expected from a retinal implant is largely based on the maximum spatial resolution of the implant current prototypes of retinal implants are capable of providing low resolution pixelated images the state of the art retinal implants incorporate 60100 channels which is sufficient for basic object discrimination and recognition tasks however simulations of the resultant pixelated images assume that all electrodes on the implant are in contact with the desired retinal cell therefore the expected spatial resolution provided is even lower as a few of the electrodes may not function optimally  tests of reading performance indicated that a 60 channel implant is sufficient to restore some reading ability but only with significantly enlarged text  similar experiments evaluating room navigation ability with pixelated images demonstrated that 60 channels were sufficient for experienced subjects while naïve subjects required 256 channels this experiment therefore not only demonstrated the functionality provided by low resolution visual feedback but also the ability for subjects to adapt and improve over time  however these experiments are based merely on simulations of low resolution vision in normal subjects rather than clinical testing of implanted subjects the number of electrodes necessary for reading or room navigation may differ in implanted subjects and further testing needs to be conducted within this clinical population to determine the required spatial resolution for specific visual tasks simulation results indicate that 6001000 electrodes would be required to enable subjects to perform a wide variety of tasks including reading face recognition and navigating around rooms  thus the available spatial resolution of retinal implants needs to increase by a factor of 10 while remaining small enough to implant to restore sufficient visual function for those tasks clinical reports to date have demonstrated mixed success with all patients report at least some sensation of light from the electrodes and a smaller proportion gaining more detailed visual function such as identifying patterns of light and dark areas the clinical reports indicate that even with low resolution retinal implants are potentially useful in providing crude vision to individuals who otherwise would not have any visual sensation  however clinical testing in implanted subjects is somewhat limited and the majority of spatial resolution simulation experiments have been conducted in normal controls it remains unclear whether the low level vision provided by current retinal implants is sufficient to balance the risks associated with the surgical procedure especially for subjects with intact peripheral vision several other aspects of retinal implants need to be addressed in future research including the long term stability of the implants and the possibility of retinal neuron plasticity in response to prolonged stimulation  the manchester royal infirmary and prof paulo e stanga announced on july 22 2015 the first successful implantation of second sights argus ii in patients suffering from severe age related macular degeneration article in times and bbc these results are very impressive as it appears that the patients integrate the residual vision and the artificial vision it potentially opens the use of retinal implants to millions of patients suffering from amd

V the human skin is the outer covering of the body in humans it is the largest organ of the integumentary system the skin has multiple layers of ectodermal tissue and guards the underlying muscles bones ligaments and internal organs  human skin is similar to that of most other mammals except that it is not protected by a fur though nearly all human skin is covered with hair follicles it can appear hairless there are two general types of skin hairy and glabrous skin  the adjective cutaneous literally means of the skin from latin cutis skin because it interfaces with the environment skin plays a key immunity role in protecting the body against pathogens  and excessive water loss  its other functions are insulation temperature regulation sensation synthesis of vitamin d and the protection of vitamin b folates severely damaged skin will try to heal by forming scar tissue this is often discolored and depigmented in humans skin pigmentation varies among populations and skin type can range from dry to oily such skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for bacteria that number roughly 1000 species from 19 phyla present on the human skin   skin has mesodermal cells pigmentation such as melanin provided by melanocytes which absorb some of the potentially dangerous ultraviolet radiation uv in sunlight it also contains dna repair enzymes that help reverse uv damage such that people lacking the genes for these enzymes suffer high rates of skin cancer one form predominantly produced by uv light malignant melanoma is particularly invasive causing it to spread quickly and can often be deadly human skin pigmentation varies among populations in a striking manner this has led to the classification of peoples on the basis of skin color  the skin is the largest organ in the human body for the average adult human the skin has a surface area of between 1520 square metres 161215 sq ft most of it between 23mm 010inch thick the average square inch 65cm² of skin holds 650 sweat glands 20 blood vessels 60000 melanocytes and more than 1000 nerve endings  the average human skin cell is said to have an area of 30 micrometers squared but there are variants a skin cell usually ranges from 2540 micrometers squared depending on a variety of factors skin is composed of three primary layers the epidermis the dermis and the hypodermis  epidermis epi coming from the greek meaning over or upon is the outermost layer of the skin it forms the waterproof protective wrap over the bodys surface which also serves as a barrier to infection and is made up of stratified squamous epithelium with an underlying basal lamina the epidermis contains no blood vessels and cells in the deepest layers are nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air  and to a far lesser degree by blood capillaries extending to the upper layers of the dermis the main type of cells which make up the epidermis are merkel cells keratinocytes with melanocytes and langerhans cells also present the epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata beginning with the outermost layer corneum lucidum only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet granulosum spinosum basale cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer the daughter cells see cell division move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source the cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted they eventually reach the corneum and slough off desquamation this process is called keratinization this keratinized layer of skin is responsible for keeping water in the body and keeping other harmful chemicals and pathogens out making skin a natural barrier to infection the epidermis contains no blood vessels and is nourished by diffusion from the dermis the main type of cells which make up the epidermis are keratinocytes melanocytes langerhans cells and merkels cells the epidermis helps the skin to regulate body temperature  epidermis is divided into several layers where cells are formed through mitosis at the innermost layers they move up the strata changing shape and composition as they differentiate and become filled with keratin they eventually reach the top layer called stratum corneum and are sloughed off or desquamated this process is called keratinization and takes place within weeks the outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells epidermis is divided into the following 5 sublayers or strata blood capillaries are found beneath the epidermis and are linked to an arteriole and a venule arterial shunt vessels may bypass the network in ears the nose and fingertips the dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that consists of epithelial tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain the dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane it also harbors many nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat it contains the hair follicles sweat glands sebaceous glands apocrine glands lymphatic vessels and blood vessels the blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste removal from its own cells as well as from the stratum basale of the epidermis the dermis is structurally divided into two areas a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis called the papillary region and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region the papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue it is named for its fingerlike projections called papillae that extend toward the epidermis the papillae provide the dermis with a bumpy surface that interdigitates with the epidermis strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin in the palms fingers soles and toes the influence of the papillae projecting into the epidermis forms contours in the skins surface these epidermal ridges occur in patterns see fingerprint that are genetically and epigenetically determined and are therefore unique to the individual making it possible to use fingerprints or footprints as a means of identification the reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker it is composed of dense irregular connective tissue and receives its name from the dense concentration of collagenous elastic and reticular fibers that weave throughout it these protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength extensibility and elasticity also located within the reticular region are the roots of the hair sebaceous glands sweat glands receptors nails and blood vessels tattoo ink is held in the dermis stretch marks from pregnancy are also located in the dermis the hypodermis is not part of the skin and lies below the dermis its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves it consists of loose connective tissue adipose tissue and elastin the main cell types are fibroblasts macrophages and adipocytes the hypodermis contains 50 of body fat fat serves as padding and insulation for the body human skin shows high skin color variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkishwhite hues human skin shows higher variation in color than any other single mammalian species and is the result of natural selection skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of ultraviolet radiation uvr penetrating the skin controlling its biochemical effects  the actual skin color of different humans is affected by many substances although the single most important substance determining human skin color is the pigment melanin melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the skin color of darkerskinned humans the skin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluishwhite connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis the red color underlying the skin becomes more visible especially in the face when as consequence of physical exercise or the stimulation of the nervous system anger fear arterioles dilate  there are at least five different pigments that determine the color of the skin   these pigments are present at different levels and places there is a correlation between the geographic distribution of uv radiation uvr and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world areas that highlight higher amounts of uvr reflect darkerskinned populations generally located nearer towards the equator areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of uvr which is reflected in lighterskinned populations  in the same population it has been observed that adult human females are considerably lighter in skin pigmentation than males females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation and vitamin d which is synthesized from sunlight helps in absorbing calcium for this reason it is thought that females may have evolved to have lighter skin in order to help their bodies absorb more calcium  the fitzpatrick scale   is a numerical classification schema for human skin color developed in 1975 as a way to classify the typical response of different types of skin to ultraviolet uv light as skin ages it becomes thinner and more easily damaged intensifying this effect is the decreasing ability of skin to heal itself as a person ages among other things skin aging is noted by a decrease in volume and elasticity there are many internal and external causes to skin aging for example aging skin receives less blood flow and lower glandular activity a validated comprehensive grading scale has categorized the clinical findings of skin aging as laxity sagging rhytids wrinkles and the various facets of photoaging including erythema redness and telangiectasia dyspigmentation brown discoloration solar elastosis yellowing keratoses abnormal growths and poor texture  cortisol causes degradation of collagen  accelerating skin aging  antiaging supplements are used to treat skin aging photoaging has two main concerns an increased risk for skin cancer and the appearance of damaged skin in younger skin sun damage will heal faster since the cells in the epidermis have a faster turnover rate while in the older population the skin becomes thinner and the epidermis turnover rate for cell repair is lower which may result in the dermis layer being damaged  skin performs the following functions the human skin is a rich environment for microbes   around 1000 species of bacteria from 19 bacterial phyla have been found most come from only four phyla actinobacteria 518 firmicutes 244 proteobacteria 165 and bacteroidetes 63 propionibacteria and staphylococci species were the main species in sebaceous areas there are three main ecological areas moist dry and sebaceous in moist places on the body corynebacteria together with staphylococci dominate in dry areas there is a mixture of species but dominated by bproteobacteria and flavobacteriales ecologically sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry ones the areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between fingers the spaces between toes axillae and umbilical cord stump most similarly were beside the nostril nares inside the nostril and on the back reflecting upon the diversity of the human skin researchers on the human skin microbiome have observed hairy moist underarms lie a short distance from smooth dry forearms but these two niches are likely as ecologically dissimilar as rainforests are to deserts  the nih has launched the human microbiome project to characterize the human microbiota which includes that on the skin and the role of this microbiome in health and disease  microorganisms like staphylococcus epidermidis colonize the skin surface the density of skin flora depends on region of the skin the disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from bacteria residing in the deeper areas of the hair follicle gut and urogenital openings diseases of the skin include skin infections and skin neoplasms including skin cancer dermatology is the branch of medicine that deals with conditions of the skin  the skin supports its own ecosystems of microorganisms including yeasts and bacteria which cannot be removed by any amount of cleaning estimates place the number of individual bacteria on the surface of one square inch 65 square cm of human skin at 50 million though this figure varies greatly over the average 20 square feet 19m  of human skin oily surfaces such as the face may contain over 500 million bacteria per square inch 65cm² despite these vast quantities all of the bacteria found on the skins surface would fit into a volume the size of a pea  in general the microorganisms keep one another in check and are part of a healthy skin when the balance is disturbed there may be an overgrowth and infection such as when antibiotics kill microbes resulting in an overgrowth of yeast the skin is continuous with the inner epithelial lining of the body at the orifices each of which supports its own complement of microbes cosmetics should be used carefully on the skin because these may cause allergic reactions each season requires suitable clothing in order to facilitate the evaporation of the sweat sunlight water and air play an important role in keeping the skin healthy oily skin is caused by overactive sebaceous glands that produce a substance called sebum a naturally healthy skin lubricant  when the skin produces excessive sebum it becomes heavy and thick in texture oily skin is typified by shininess blemishes and pimples  the oilyskin type is not necessarily bad since such skin is less prone to wrinkling or other signs of aging  because the oil helps to keep needed moisture locked into the epidermis outermost layer of skin the negative aspect of the oilyskin type is that oily complexions are especially susceptible to clogged pores blackheads and buildup of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin  oily skin can be sallow and rough in texture and tends to have large clearly visible pores everywhere except around the eyes and neck  human skin has a low permeability that is most foreign substances are unable to penetrate and diffuse through the skin skins outermost layer the stratum corneum is an effective barrier to most inorganic nanosized particles   this protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to come into contact with internal tissues however in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in nanomedicine and biology to increase skin permeability one application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where nanoparticles can interact directly with cells that have lost their growthcontrol mechanisms cancer cells such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity nanoparticles 40nm in diameter and smaller have been successful in penetrating the skin    research confirms that nanoparticles larger than 40nm do not penetrate the skin past the stratum corneum  most particles that do penetrate will diffuse through skin cells but some will travel down hair follicles and reach the dermis layer the permeability of skin relative to different shapes of nanoparticles has also been studied research has shown that spherical particles have a better ability to penetrate the skin compared to oblong ellipsoidal particles because spheres are symmetric in all three spatial dimensions  one study compared the two shapes and recorded data that showed spherical particles located deep in the epidermis and dermis whereas ellipsoidal particles were mainly found in the stratum corneum and epidermal layers  nanorods are used in experiments because of their unique fluorescent properties but have shown mediocre penetration nanoparticles of different materials have shown skins permeability limitations in many experiments gold nanoparticles 40nm in diameter or smaller are used and have shown to penetrate to the epidermis titanium oxide tio2 zinc oxide zno and silver nanoparticles are ineffective in penetrating the skin past the stratum corneum   cadmium selenide cdse quantum dots have proven to penetrate very effectively when they have certain properties because cdse is toxic to living organisms the particle must be covered in a surface group an experiment comparing the permeability of quantum dots coated in polyethylene glycol peg pegamine and carboxylic acid concluded the peg and pegamine surface groups allowed for the greatest penetration of particles the carboxylic acid coated particles did not penetrate past the stratum corneum  scientists previously believed that the skin was an effective barrier to inorganic particles damage from mechanical stressors was believed to be the only way to increase its permeability  recently however simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin permeability have been developed for example ultraviolet radiation uvr has been used to slightly damage the surface of skin causing a timedependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles  the uvrs high energy causes a restructuring of cells weakening the boundary between the stratum corneum and the epidermal layer   the damage of the skin is typically measured by the transepidermal water loss tewl though it may take 35 days for the tewl to reach its peak value when the tewl reaches its highest value the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to permeate the skin studies confirm that uvr damaged skin significantly increases the permeability   the effects of increased permeability after uvr exposure can lead to an increase in the number of particles that permeate the skin however the specific permeability of skin after uvr exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined  other skin damaging methods used to increase nanoparticle penetration include tape stripping skin abrasion and chemical enhancement tape stripping is the process in which tape is applied to skin then lifted to remove the top layer of skin skin abrasion is done by shaving the top 510 micrometers off the surface of the skin chemical enhancement is the process in which chemicals such as polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and oleic acid are applied to the surface of the skin to increase permeability   electroporation is the application of short pulses of electric fields on skin and has proven to increase skin permeability the pulses are high voltage and on the order of milliseconds when applied charged molecules penetrate the skin more frequently than neutral molecules after the skin has been exposed to electric field pulses results have shown molecules on the order of 100 micrometers to easily permeate electroporated skin  a large area of interest in nanomedicine is the transdermal patch because of the possibility of a painless application of therapeutic agents with very few side effects transdermal patches have been limited to administer a small number of drugs such as nicotine because of the limitations in permeability of the skin development of techniques that increase skin permeability has led to more drugs that can be applied via transdermal patches and more options for patients  increasing the permeability of skin allows nanoparticles to penetrate and target cancer cells nanoparticles along with multimodal imaging techniques have been used as a way to diagnose cancer noninvasively skin with high permeability allowed quantum dots with an antibody attached to the surface for active targeting to successfully penetrate and identify cancerous tumors in mice tumor targeting is beneficial because the particles can be excited using fluorescence microscopy and emit light energy and heat that will destroy cancer cells  sunblock and sunscreen are different important skincare products though both offer full protection from the sun   sunblocksunblock is opaque and stronger than sunscreen since it is able to block most of the uvauvb rays and radiation from the sun and does not need to be reapplied several times in a day titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are two of the important ingredients in sunblock  sunscreensunscreen is more transparent once applied to the skin and also has the ability to protect against uvauvb rays although the sunscreens ingredients have the ability to break down at a faster rate once exposed to sunlight and some of the radiation is able to penetrate to the skin in order for sunscreen to be more effective it is necessary to consistently reapply and use one with a higher sun protection factor vitamin a also known as retinoids benefits the skin by normalizing keratinization downregulating sebum production which contributes to acne and reversing and treating photodamage striae and cellulite vitamin d and analogs are used to downregulate the cutaneous immune system and epithelial proliferation while promoting differentiation vitamin c is an antioxidant that regulates collagen synthesis forms barrier lipids regenerates vitamin e and provides photoprotection vitamin e is a membrane antioxidant that protects against oxidative damage and also provides protection against harmful uv rays   several scientific studies confirmed that changes in baseline nutritional status

V the liver is a vital organ of vertebrates and some other animals  in the human it is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen below the diaphragm the liver has a wide range of functions including detoxification of various metabolites protein synthesis and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion  the liver is a gland and plays a major role in metabolism with numerous functions in the human body including regulation of glycogen storage decomposition of red blood cells plasma protein synthesis hormone production and detoxification  it is an accessory digestive gland and produces bile an alkaline compound which aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids the gallbladder a small pouch that sits just under the liver stores bile produced by the liver  the livers highly specialized tissue consisting of mostly hepatocytes regulates a wide variety of highvolume biochemical reactions including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules many of which are necessary for normal vital functions  estimates regarding the organs total number of functions vary but textbooks generally cite it being around 500  terminology related to the liver often starts in hepar or hepat from the greek word for liver h\u0113par \u1f27\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1 root hepat \u1f21\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4   there is currently no way to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term although liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term  liver transplantation is the only option for complete liver failure   the liver is a reddish brown wedgeshaped organ with four lobes of unequal size and shape a human liver normally weighs 144166kg 3237lb  it is both the heaviest internal organ and the largest gland in the human body located in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity it rests just below the diaphragm to the right of the stomach and overlies the gallbladder  the liver is connected to two large blood vessels the hepatic artery and the portal vein the hepatic artery carries oxygenrich blood from the aorta whereas the portal vein carries blood rich in digested nutrients from the entire gastrointestinal tract and also from the spleen and pancreas  these blood vessels subdivide into small capillaries known as liver sinusoids which then lead to a lobule lobules are the functional units of the liver each lobule is made up of millions of hepatic cells hepatocytes which are the basic metabolic cells the lobules are held together by fine areolar tissue which extends into the structure of the liver by accompanying the vessels veins and arteries ducts and nerves through the hepatic portal as a fibrous capsule called glissons capsule  the whole surface of the liver is covered in a serous coat derived from peritoneum and this has an inner fibrous coat glissons capsule to which it is firmly adhered the fibrous coat is of areolar tissue and follows the vessels and ducts to support them gross anatomy traditionally divided the liver into two portions a right and a left lobe as viewed from the front diaphragmatic surface but the underside the visceral surface shows it to be divided into four lobes and includes the caudate and quadrate lobes  the falciform ligament visible on the front of the liver divides the liver into a left and a much larger right lobe from the visceral surface the two additional lobes are located between the right and left lobes one in front of the other a line can be imagined running from the left of the vena cava and all the way forward to divide the liver and gallbladder into two halves  this line is called cantlies line  other anatomical landmarks exist such as the ligamentum venosum and the round ligament of the liver ligamentum teres which further divide the left side of the liver in two sections an important anatomical landmark the porta hepatis also known as the transverse fissure of the liver divides this left portion into four segments which can be numbered starting at the caudate lobe as i in an anticlockwise manner from this visceral view seven segments can be seen because the eighth segment is only visible in the parietal view  on the diaphragmatic surface apart from a large triangular bare area where it connects to the diaphragm the liver is covered by a thin doublelayered membrane the peritoneum that help reduces friction against other organs  this surface covers the convex shape of the two lobes where it accommodates the shape of the diaphragm the peritoneum folds back on itself to form the falciform ligament and the right and left triangular ligaments  these peritoneal ligaments are not related to the anatomic ligaments in joints and the right and left triangular ligaments have no known functional importance though they serve as surface landmarks  the falciform ligament functions to attach the liver to the posterior portion of the anterior body wall the visceral surface or inferior surface is uneven and concave it is covered in peritoneum apart from where it attaches the gallbladder and the porta hepatis  there are several impressions on the surface of the liver which accommodate the various adjacent structures and organs underneath the right lobe and to the right of the gallbladder fossa are two impressions one behind the other and separated by a ridge the one in front is a shallow colic impression formed by the hepatic flexure and the one behind is a deeper renal impression accommodating part of the right kidney and part of the suprarenal gland  the suprarenal impression is a small triangular depressed area on the liver it is located close to the right of the fossa between the bare area and the caudate lobe and immediately above the renal impression the greater part of the suprarenal impression is devoid of peritoneum and it lodges the right suprarenal gland  medial to the renal impression is a third and slightly marked impression lying between it and the neck of the gallbladder this is caused by the descending portion of the duodenum and is known as the duodenal impression  the inferior surface of the left lobe of the liver presents behind and to the left the gastric impression  this is moulded over the upper front surface of the stomach and to the right of this is a rounded eminence the tuber omentale which fits into the concavity of the lesser curvature of the stomach and lies in front of the anterior layer of the lesser omentum microscopically each liver lobe is seen to be made up of hepatic lobules the lobules are roughly hexagonal and consist of plates of hepatocytes radiating from a central vein  the central vein joins to the hepatic vein to carry blood out from the liver a distinctive component of a lobule is the portal triad which can be found running along each of the lobules corners the portal triad misleadingly named consists of five structures a branch of the hepatic artery a branch of the hepatic portal vein and a bile duct as well as lymphatic vessels and a branch of the vagus nerve  between the hepatocyte plates are liver sinusoids which are enlarged capillaries through which blood from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery enters via the portal triads then drains to the central vein  histology the study of microscopic anatomy shows two major types of liver cell parenchymal cells and nonparenchymal cells 7085 of the liver volume is occupied by parenchymal hepatocytes nonparenchymal cells constitute 40 of the total number of liver cells but only 65 of its volume  the liver sinusoids are lined with two types of cell sinusoidal endothelial cells and phagocytic kupffer cells  hepatic stellate cells are nonparenchymal cells found in the space of disse between a sinusoid and a hepatocyte  additionally intrahepatic lymphocytes are often present in the sinusoidal lumen  the central area or hilum known as the porta hepatis is where the common bile duct hepatic portal vein and the hepatic artery proper enter the liver the duct vein and artery divide into left and right branches and the areas of the liver supplied by these branches constitute the functional left and right lobesthe functional lobes are separated by the imaginary plane cantlies line joining the gallbladder fossa to the inferior vena cava the plane separates the liver into the true right and left lobes the middle hepatic vein also demarcates the true right and left lobes the right lobe is further divided into an anterior and posterior segment by the right hepatic vein the left lobe is divided into the medial and lateral segments by the left hepatic vein the fissure for the round ligament of the liver ligamentum teres also separates the medial and lateral segments the medial segment is also called the quadrate lobe in the widely used couinaud or french system the functional lobes are further divided into a total of eight subsegments based on a transverse plane through the bifurcation of the main portal vein  the caudate lobe is a separate structure which receives blood flow from both the right and leftsided vascular branches   the couinaud classification of liver anatomy divides the liver into eight functionally independent segments each segment has its own vascular inflow outflow and biliary drainage in the centre of each segment there is a branch of the portal vein hepatic artery and bile duct in the periphery of each segment there is vascular outflow through the hepatic veins  the division of the liver into independent units means that segments can be resected without damaging the remaining segments  to preserve the viability of the liver following surgery resections follow the vessels defining the peripheries of each segment this means that resection lines parallel the hepatic veins leaving the portal veins bile ducts and hepatic arteries intact  the classification system uses the vascular supply in the liver to separate the functional units numbered i to viii the remainder of the units ii to viii are numbered in a clockwise fashion  units v to viii make up the right part of the liver  organogenesis the development of the organs takes place from the third to the eighth week in human embryogenesis the origins of the liver lie in both the ventral portion of the foregut endoderm endoderm being one of the 3 embryonic germ layers and the constituents of the adjacent septum transversum mesenchyme in the human embryo the hepatic diverticulum is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme the mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate to branch and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver a portion of the hepatic diverticulum that region closest to the digestive tube continues to function as the drainage duct of the liver and a branch from this duct produces the gallbladder  besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme fibroblast growth factor from the developing heart also contributes to hepatic competence along with retinoic acid emanating from the lateral plate mesoderm the hepatic endodermal cells undergo a morphological transition from columnar to pseudostratified resulting in thickening into the early liver bud their expansion forms a population of the bipotential hepatoblasts  hepatic stellate cells are derived from mesenchyme  after migration of hepatoblasts into the septum transversum mesenchyme the hepatic architecture begins to be established with liver sinusoids and bile canaliculi appearing the liver bud separates into the lobes the left umbilical vein becomes the ductus venosus and the right vitelline vein becomes the portal vein the expanding liver bud is colonized by hematopoietic cells the bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes the biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins first producing a monolayer and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells in ductal plate focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer become surrounded by portal mesenchyme and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant glycogen accumulation in the adult liver hepatocytes are not equivalent with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a liver lobule dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism carbohydrate metabolism ammonia detoxification and bile production and secretion wnt\u03b2catenin has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon  in the growing fetus a major source of blood to the liver is the umbilical vein which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus the umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver there it joins with the left branch of the portal vein the ductus venosus carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the inferior vena cava allowing placental blood to bypass the liver in the fetus the liver develops throughout normal gestation and does not perform the normal filtration of the infant liver the liver does not perform digestive processes because the fetus does not consume meals directly but receives nourishment from the mother via the placenta the fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal thymus so initially the lymphocytes called tcells are created from fetal liver stem cells once the fetus is delivered the formation of blood stem cells in infants shifts to the red bone marrow after birth the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated in two to five days the former becomes the ligamentum teres and the latter becomes the ligamentum venosum in the disease state of cirrhosis and portal hypertension the umbilical vein can open up again at birth the liver comprises roughly 4 of body weight and is at average 120g over the course of development it will increase to 1416kg but will only take up 2535 of body weight  the various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes the liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions usually in combination with other systems and organs currently there is no artificial organ or device capable of emulating all the functions of the liver some functions can be emulated by liver dialysis an experimental treatment for liver failure the liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries the hepatic portal vein delivers approximately 75 of the livers blood supply and carries venous blood drained from the spleen gastrointestinal tract and its associated organs the hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver accounting for the remaining quarter of its blood flow oxygen is provided from both sources approximately half of the livers oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein and half is met by the hepatic arteries  blood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule the central veins coalesce into hepatic veins which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava  axial ct image showing anomalous hepatic veins coursing on the subcapsular anterior surface of the liver  maximum intensity projection mip ct image as viewed anteriorly showing the anomalous hepatic veins coursing on the anterior surface of the liver lateral mip view in the same patient a ct scan in which the liver and portal vein are shown the biliary tract is derived from the branches of the bile ducts the biliary tract also known as the biliary tree is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine the duodenum the bile produced in the liver is collected in bile canaliculi small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes the canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule where they merge to form bile ducts within the liver these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts and once they exit the liver they are considered extrahepatic the intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left hepatic ducts which exit the liver at the transverse fissure and merge to form the common hepatic duct the cystic duct from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct  bile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla also known as the ampulla of vater the liver plays a major role in carbohydrate protein amino acid and lipid metabolism the liver performs several roles in carbohydrate metabolism the liver synthesizes and stores approximately 100g of glycogen via glycogenesis the formation of glycogen from glucose when needed the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing glycogenolysis the breakdown of glycogen into glucose  the liver is also responsible for gluconeogenesis which is the synthesis of glucose from certain amino acids lactate or glycerol adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by breakdown of fat which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis  the liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein metabolism synthesis as well as degradation it is also responsible for a large part of amino acid synthesis the liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors as well as red blood cell production some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include coagulation factors i fibrinogen ii prothrombin v vii viii ix x and xi as well as protein c protein s and antithrombin in the first trimester fetus the liver is the main site of red blood cell production by the 32nd week of gestation the bone marrow has almost completely taken over that task the liver is a major site of production for thrombopoietin a glycoprotein hormone that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow  the liver plays several roles in lipid metabolism it performs cholesterol synthesis lipogenesis the production of triglycerides and a bulk of the bodys lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver the liver plays a key role in digestion as it produces and excretes bile a yellowish liquid required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin k from the diet some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum and some is stored in the gallbladder the liver also produces insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 a polypeptide protein hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults the liver is responsible for the breakdown of insulin and other hormones the liver breaks down bilirubin via glucuronidation facilitating its excretion into bile the liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products it plays a key role in breaking down or modifying toxic substances eg methylation and most medicinal products in a process called drug metabolism this sometimes results in toxication when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor preferably the toxins are conjugated to avail excretion in bile or urine the liver breaks down ammonia into urea as part of the urea cycle and the urea is excreted in the urine  the oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging and therefore any medications that require oxidation for instance benzodiazepines are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels however medications with shorter halflives such as lorazepam and oxazepam are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regards to geriatric medicine the liver supports almost every organ in the body and is vital for survival because of its strategic location and multidimensional functions the liver is also prone to many diseases the bare area of the liver is a site that is vulnerable to the passing of infection from the abdominal cavity to the thoracic cavity hepatitis is a common condition of inflammation of the liver the most usual cause of this is viral and the most common of these infections are hepatitis a b c d and e some of these infections are sexually transmitted inflammation can also be caused by other viruses in the herpesviridae family such as the herpes simplex virus infection with hepatitis b virus or hepatitis c virus is the main cause of liver cancer other disorders caused by excessive alcohol consumption are grouped under alcoholic liver diseases and these include alcoholic hepatitis fatty liver and cirrhosis liver damage can also be caused by drugs particularly paracetomol and drugs used to treat cancer buddchiari syndrome is a condition caused by blockage of the hepatic veins including thrombosis that drain the liver it presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain ascites and liver enlargement  primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease of the liver   it is marked by slow progressive destruction of the small bile ducts of the liver with the intralobular ducts canals of hering affected early in the disease  when these ducts are damaged bile and other toxins build up in the liver cholestasis and over time damages the liver tissue in combination with ongoing immune related damage this can lead to scarring fibrosis and cirrhosis many diseases of the liver are accompanied by jaundice caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the system the bilirubin results from the breakup of the hemoglobin of dead red blood cells normally the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile there are also many pediatric liver diseases including biliary atresia alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency alagille syndrome progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis langerhans cell histiocytosis and hepatic hemangioma a benign tumour the most common type of liver tumour thought to be congenital diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes however the liver has a great capacity to regenerate and has a large reserve capacity in most cases the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage hepatomegaly refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes it can be palpated in a liver span measurement liver diseases may be diagnosed by liver function testsblood tests that can identify various markers for example acutephase reactants are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation the classic symptoms of liver damage include the following the diagnosis of liver disease is made by liver function tests groups of blood tests that can readily show the extent of liver damage if infection is suspected then other serological tests will be carried out sometimes an ultrasound or a ct scan is needed to produce an image of the liver physical examination of the liver can only reveal its size and any tenderness and some form of imaging will also be needed  damage to the liver is sometimes determined with a biopsy particularly when the cause of liver damage is unknown in the 21st century they have been largely replaced by highresolution radiographic scans the latter do not require ultrasound guidance lab involvement microscopic analysis organ damage pain or patient sedation and the results are available immediately on a computer screen  in a biopsy a needle is inserted into the skin just below the rib cage and a tissue sample obtained the tissue is sent to the laboratory where it is analyzed under a microscope sometimes a radiologist may assist the physician performing a liver biopsy by providing ultrasound guidance  the liver is the only human internal organ capable of natural regeneration of lost tissue as little as 25 of a liver can regenerate into a whole liver  this is however not true regeneration but rather compensatory growth in mammals  the lobes that are removed do not regrow and the growth of the liver is a restoration of function not original form this contrasts with true regeneration where both original function and form are restored in some other species such as fish the liver undergoes true regeneration by restoring both shape and size of the organ  in liver large areas of the tissues are formed but for the formation of new cells there must be sufficient amount of material so the circulation of the blood becomes more active  this is predominantly due to the hepatocytes reentering the cell cycle that is the hepatocytes go from the quiescent g0 phase to the g1 phase and undergo mitosis this process is activated by the p75 receptors  there is also some evidence of bipotential stem cells called hepatic oval cells or ovalocytes not to be confused with oval red blood cells of ovalocytosis which are thought to reside in the canals of hering these cells can differentiate into either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes cholangiocytes are the epithelial lining cells of the bile ducts  they are cuboidal epithelium in the small interlobular bile ducts but become columnar and mucus secreting in larger bile ducts approaching the porta hepatis and the extrahepatic ducts scientific and medical works about liver regeneration often refer to the greek titan prometheus who was chained to a rock in the caucasus where each day his liver was devoured by an eagle only to grow back each night the myth suggests the ancient greeks may have known about the livers remarkable capacity for selfrepair  human liver transplants were first performed by thomas starzl in the united states and roy calne in cambridge england in 1963 and 1967 respectively liver transplantation is the only option for those with irreversible liver failure most transplants are done for chronic liver diseases leading to cirrhosis such as chronic hepatitis c alcoholism autoimmune hepatitis and many others less commonly liver transplantation is done for fulminant hepatic failure in which liver failure occurs over days to weeks liver allografts for transplant usually come from donors who have died from fatal brain injury living donor liver transplantation is a technique in which a portion of a living persons liver is removed and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient this was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation only 20 percent of an adults liver couinaud segments 2 and 3 is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child more recently adulttoadult liver transplantation has been done using the donors right hepatic lobe which amounts to 60 percent of the liver due to the ability of the liver to regenerate both the donor and recipient end up with normal liver function if all goes well this procedure is more controversial as it entails performing a much larger operation on the donor and indeed there have been at least two donor deaths out of the first several hundred cases a recent publication has addressed the problem of donor mortality and at least 14 cases have been found  the risk of postoperative complications and death is far greater in rightsided operations than that in leftsided operations with the recent advances of noninvasive imaging living liver donors usually have to undergo imaging examinations for liver anatomy to decide if the anatomy is feasible for donation the evaluation is usually performed by multidetector row computed tomography mdct and magnetic resonance imaging mri mdct is good in vascular anatomy and volumetry mri is used for biliary tree anatomy donors with very unusual vascular anatomy which makes them unsuitable for donation could be screened out to avoid unnecessary operations mdct image arterial anatomy contraindicated for liver donation mdct image portal venous anatomy contraindicated for liver donation mdct image 3d image created by mdct can clearly visualize the liver measure the liver volume and plan the dissection plane to facilitate the liver transplantation procedure phase contrast ct image contrast is perfusing the right liver but not the left due to a left portal vein thrombus in greek mythology prometheus was punished by the gods for revealing fire to humans by being chained to a rock where a vulture or an eagle would peck out his liver which would regenerate overnight the liver is the only human internal organ that actually can regenerate itself to a significant extent many ancient peoples of the near east and mediterranean areas practiced a type of divination called haruspicy where they tried to obtain information by examining the livers of sheep and other animals in plato and in later physiology the liver was thought to be the seat of the darkest emotions specifically wrath jealousy and greed which drive men to action  the talmud tractate berakhot 61b refers to the liver as the seat of anger with the gallbladder counteracting this the persian urdu and hindi languages \u062c\u06af\u0631 or \u091c\u0917\u0930 or jigar refer to the liver in figurative speech to indicate courage and strong feelings or their best eg this mecca has thrown to you the pieces of its liver  the term jan e jigar literally the strength power of my liver is a term of endearment in urdu in persian slang jigar is used as an adjective for any object which is desirable especially women in the zulu language the word for liver isibindi is the same as the word for courage the legend of livereating johnson says that he would cut out and eat the liver of each man killed after dinner in the motion picture the message hind bint utbah is implied or portrayed eating the liver of hamza ibn abd almuttalib during the battle of uhud although there are narrations that suggest that hind did taste rather than eat the liver of hamza the authenticity of these narrations have to be questioned the liver of mammals fowl and fish are commonly eaten as food by humans domestic pig ox lamb calf chicken and goose livers are widely available from butchers and supermarkets liver can be baked boiled broiled fried stirfried or eaten raw asbeh nayeh or sawda naye in lebanese cuisine liver sashimi in many preparations pieces of liver are combined with pieces of meat or kidneys like in the various forms of middle eastern mixed grill eg meurav yerushalmi liver is often made into spreads wellknown examples include liver pâté foie gras chopped liver and leverpastej liver sausages such as braunschweiger and liverwurst are also a valued meal liver sausages may also be used as spreads a traditional south african delicacy namely skilpadjies is made of minced lambs liver wrapped in netvet caul fat and grilled over an open fire animal livers are rich in iron and vitamin a and cod liver oil is commonly used as a dietary supplement traditionally some fish livers were valued as food especially the stingray liver it was used to prepare delicacies such as poached skate liver on toast in england as well as the beignets de foie de raie and foie de raie en croute in french cuisine  the liver is found in all vertebrates and is typically the largest visceral internal organ its form varies considerably in different species and is largely determined by the shape and arrangement of the surrounding organs nonetheless in most species it is divided into right and left lobes exceptions to this general rule include snakes where the shape of the body necessitates a simple cigarlike form the internal structure of the liver is broadly similar in all vertebrates  an organ sometimes referred to as a liver is found associated with the digestive tract of the primitive chordate amphioxus although it performs many functions of a liver it is not considered a true liver but a homolog of the vertebrate liver    the amphioxus hepatic caecum produces the liverspecific proteins vitellogenin antithrombin plasminogen alanine aminotransferase and insulininsulinlike growth factor

V the lateral ventricles are part of the ventricular system of the brain both cerebral hemispheres contain a lateral ventricle the lateral ventricles are the largest of the ventricles each lateral ventricle resembles a cshaped structure that begins at an inferior horn in the temporal lobe travels through a body in the parietal lobe and frontal lobe and ultimately terminates at the interventricular foramina where each lateral ventricle connects to the central third ventricle along the path a posterior horn extends backward into the occipital lobe and an anterior horn extends farther into the frontal lobe   each lateral ventricle has three horns also called cornus they can be referred to by their position in the ventricle or by the lobe that they extend into the anterior horn of lateral ventricle or frontal horn passes forward and to the side with a slight inclination downward from the interventricular foramen into the frontal lobe and curves around the front of the caudate nucleus its floor is formed by the upper surface of the reflected portion of the corpus callosum the rostrum it is bounded medially by the front part of the septum pellucidum and laterally by the head of the caudate nucleus its apex reaches the posterior surface of the genu of the corpus callosum the posterior horn of lateral ventricle or occipital horn passes into the occipital lobe its direction is backward and lateralward and then medial ward its roof is formed by the fibers of the corpus callosum passing to the temporal and occipital lobes on its medial wall is a longitudinal eminence the calcar avis hippocampus minor which is an involution of the ventricular wall produced by the calcarine sulcus above this the forceps posterior of the corpus callosum sweeping around to enter the occipital lobe causes another projection termed the bulb of the posterior cornu the calcar avis and bulb of the posterior cornu are extremely variable in their degree of development in some cases they are illdefined in others prominent the inferior horn of lateral ventricle or temporal horn is the largest of the horns it traverses the temporal lobe forming a curve around the posterior end of the thalamus it passes at first backward lateralward and downward and then curves forward to within 25cm of the apex of the temporal lobe its direction is fairly well indicated on the brain surface by the superior temporal sulcus its roof is formed chiefly by the inferior surface of the tapetum of the corpus callosum but the tail of the caudate nucleus and the stria terminalis also extend forward in the roof of the temporal horn to its extremity the tail of the caudate nucleus joins the putamen its floor presents the following parts the hippocampus the fimbria hippocampi the collateral eminence and the choroid plexus when the choroid plexus is removed a cleftlike opening is left along the medial wall of the temporal horn this cleft constitutes the lower part of the choroidal fissure the body of the lateral ventricle is the central portion just posterior to the frontal horn the trigone of the lateral ventricle is a triangular area defined by the temporal horn inferiorly the occipital horn posteriorly and the body of the lateral ventricle anteriorly the cella media is the central part of the lateral ventricle ependyma cover the inside of the lateral ventricles and are epithelial cells  the lateral ventricles similarly to other parts of the ventricular system of the brain develop from the central canal of the neural tube specifically the lateral ventricles originate from the portion of the tube that is present in the developing prosencephalon and subsequently in the developing telencephalon  during the first three months of prenatal development the central canal expands into lateral third and fourth ventricles connected by thinner channels  in the lateral ventricles specialized areas  choroid plexuses  appear which produce cerebrospinal fluid if its production is bigger than reabsorption or its circulation is blocked the enlargement of the ventricles may appear and cause a hydrocephalus fetal lateral ventricles may be diagnosed using linear or planar measurements  the volume of the lateral ventricles are known to increase with age they are also enlarged in a number of neurological conditions and are on average larger in patients with schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  major depressive disorder  and alzheimers disease  the structures of the ventricular system are embryologically derived from the neural canal the centre of the neural tube as the part of the primitive neural tube that will develop into the brainstem the neural canal expands dorsally and laterally creating the fourth ventricle whereas the neural canal that does not expand and remains the same at the level of the midbrain superior to the fourth ventricle forms the cerebral aqueduct the fourth ventricle narrows at the obex in the caudal medulla to become the central canal of the spinal cord position of lateral ventricles shown in red drawing of a cast of the ventricular cavities viewed from above lateral ventricles lateral ventricle

V skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates other animal coverings such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin structure and chemical composition the adjective cutaneous means of the skin from latin cutis skin in mammals the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue and guards the underlying muscles bones ligaments and internal organs  skin of a different nature exists in amphibians reptiles and birds  all mammals have some hair on their skin even marine mammals like whales dolphins and porpoises which appear to be hairless the skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors for example the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens  and excessive water loss  its other functions are insulation temperature regulation sensation and the production of vitamin d folates severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue this is sometimes discoloured and depigmented the thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism in humans for example the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 05mm thick and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as crows feet and wrinkles the skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4mm thick and the back is 14mm thick and is the thickest skin in the body the speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen    fur is dense hair  primarily fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage on some animals the skin is very hard and thick and can be processed to create leather reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection and birds have hard feathers all made of tough \u03b2keratins amphibian skin is not a strong barrier especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces for example a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly as the chemical diffuses through its skin amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions     mammalian skin is composed of two primary layers the epidermis is composed of the outermost layers of the skin it forms a protective barrier over the bodys surface responsible for keeping water in the body and preventing pathogens from entering and is a stratified squamous epithelium  composed of proliferating basal and differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes the epidermis also helps the skin regulate body temperature  keratinocytes are the major cells constituting 95 of the epidermis  while merkel cells melanocytes and langerhans cells are also present the epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata or layers beginning with the outermost layer  keratinocytes in the stratum basale proliferate through mitosis and the daughter cells move up the strata changing shape and composition as they undergo multiple stages of cell differentiation to eventually become anucleated during that process keratinocytes will become highly organized forming cellular junctions desmosomes between each other and secreting keratin proteins and lipids which contribute to the formation of an extracellular matrix and provide mechanical strength to the skin  keratinocytes from the stratum corneum are eventually shed from the surface desquamation the epidermis contains no blood vessels and cells in the deepest layers are nourished by diffusion from blood capillaries extending to the upper layers of the dermis the epidermis and dermis are separated by a thin sheet of fibers called the basement membrane and is made through the action of both tissues the basement membrane controls the traffic of the cells and molecules between the dermis and epidermis but also serves through the binding of a variety of cytokines and growth factors as a reservoir for their controlled release during physiological remodeling or repair processes  the dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that consists of connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain the dermis provides tensile strength and elasticity to the skin through an extracellular matrix composed of collagen fibrils microfibrils and elastic fibers embedded in hyaluronan and proteoglycans  skin proteoglycans are varied and have very specific locations  for example hyaluronan versican and decorin are present throughout the dermis and epidermis extracellular matrix whereas biglycan and perlecan are only found in the epidermis it harbors many mechanoreceptors nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat it also contains the hair follicles sweat glands sebaceous glands apocrine glands lymphatic vessels and blood vessels the blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste removal from its own cells as well as for the epidermis the dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis through a basement membrane and is structurally divided into two areas a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis called the papillary region and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region the papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissuethis is named for its fingerlike projections called papillae that extend toward the epidermis the papillae provide the dermis with a bumpy surface that interdigitates with the epidermis strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin the reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker it is composed of dense irregular connective tissue and receives its name from the dense concentration of collagenous elastic and reticular fibers that weave throughout it these protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength extensibility and elasticity also located within the reticular region are the roots of the hair sebaceous glands sweat glands receptors nails and blood vessels the hypodermis is not part of the skin and lies below the dermis its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves it consists of loose connective tissue and elastin the main cell types are fibroblasts macrophages and adipocytes the hypodermis contains 50 of body fat fat serves as padding and insulation for the body another name for the hypodermis is the subcutaneous tissue microorganisms like staphylococcus epidermidis colonize the skin surface the density of skin flora depends on region of the skin the disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from bacteria residing in the deeper areas of the hair follicle gut and urogenital openings the epidermis of fish and of most amphibians consists entirely of live cells with only minimal quantities of keratin in the cells of the superficial layer it is generally permeable and in the case of many amphibians may actually be a major respiratory organ the dermis of bony fish typically contains relatively little of the connective tissue found in tetrapods instead in most species it is largely replaced by solid protective bony scales apart from some particularly large dermal bones that form parts of the skull these scales are lost in tetrapods although many reptiles do have scales of a different kind as do pangolins cartilaginous fish have numerous toothlike denticles embedded in their skin in place of true scales sweat glands and sebaceous glands are both unique to mammals but other types of skin gland are found in other vertebrates fish typically have a numerous individual mucussecreting skin cells that aid in insulation and protection but may also have poison glands photophores or cells that produce a more watery serous fluid in amphibians the mucus cells are gathered together to form saclike glands most living amphibians also possess granular glands in the skin that secrete irritating or toxic compounds  although melanin is found in the skin of many species in the reptiles the amphibians and fish the epidermis is often relatively colourless instead the colour of the skin is largely due to chromatophores in the dermis which in addition to melanin may contain guanine or carotenoid pigments many species such as chameleons and flounders may be able to change the colour of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their chromatophores  the epidermis of birds and reptiles is closer to that of mammals with a layer of dead keratinfilled cells at the surface to help reduce water loss a similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial amphibians such as toads however in all of these animals there is no clear differentiation of the epidermis into distinct layers as occurs in humans with the change in cell type being relatively gradual the mammalian epidermis always possesses at least a stratum germinativum and stratum corneum but the other intermediate layers found in humans are not always distinguishable hair is a distinctive feature of mammalian skin while feathers are at least among living species similarly unique to birds  birds and reptiles have relatively few skin glands although there may be a few structures for specific purposes such as pheromonesecreting cells in some reptiles or the uropygial gland of most birds  skin performs the following functions skin has a soft tissue mechanical behavior when stretched the intact skin is prestreched like wetsuits around the divers body when deep cuts are made on the skin it retracts widening the slice hole the term skin may also refer to the covering of a small animal such as a sheep goat goatskin pig snake snakeskin etc or the young of a large animal the term hides or rawhide refers to the covering of a large adult animal such as a cow buffalo horse etc skins and hides from the different animals are used for clothing bags and other consumer products usually in the form of leather but also as furs skin from sheep goat and cattle was used to make parchment for manuscripts skin can also be cooked to make pork rind or crackling

V language has a long evolutionary history and is closely related to the brain but what makes the human brain uniquely adapted to language is unclear the regions of the brain that are involved in language in humans have similar analogues in apes and monkeys and yet they do not use language there may also be a genetic component mutations in the foxp2 gene prevent humans from constructing complete sentences    these regions are where language is located in the brain everything from speech to reading and writing  language itself is based on symbols used to represent concepts in the world and this system appears to be housed in these areas the language regions in human brains highly resemble similar regions in other primates even though humans are the only species that use language  the brain structures of chimps are very similar to those of humans both contain brocas and wernickes homologues that are involved in communication brocas area is largely used for planning and producing vocalizations in both chimps and humans wernickes area appears to be where linguistic representations and symbols are mapped to specific concepts this functionality is present in both chimps and humans the chimp wernickes area is much more similar to its human counterpart than is the brocas area suggesting that wernickes is more evolutionary ancient than brocas  in order to speak the breathing system must be voluntarily repurposed to produce vocal sounds  which allows the breathing mechanisms to be temporarily deactivated in favor of song or speech production the human vocal tract has evolved to be more suited to speaking with a lower larynx 90 turn in the windpipe and large round tongue  motor neurons in birds and humans bypass the unconscious systems in the brainstem to give direct control of the larynx to the brain  the earliest language was strictly vocal reading and writing came later  new research suggests that the combination of gestures and vocalizations may have led to the development of more complicated language in protohumans chimps that produce attentiongetting sounds show activation in areas of the brain that are highly similar to brocas area in humans   even hand and mouth movements with no vocalizations cause very similar activation patterns in the brocas area of both humans and monkeys  when monkeys view other monkeys gesturing mirror neurons in the brocas homologue activate groups of mirror neurons are specialized to respond only to one kind of viewed action and it is currently believed that these may be an evolutionary origin to the neurons that are adapted for speech processing and production  the language bioprogram hypothesis proposes that humans have an innate cognitive grammatical structure allowing them to develop and understand language according to this theory this system is embedded in human genetics and underpins the basic grammar of all languages  some evidence suggests that at least some of our linguistic capacities may be genetically controlled mutations in the foxp2 gene prevent people from combining words and phrases into sentences  however these genes are present in the heart lungs and brain and their role is not entirely clear  it is possible that the human capacity for grammar evolved from nonsemantic behavior like singing  birds have the ability to produce process and learn complex vocalizations but the units of a birdsong when removed from the larger meaning and context of the birdsong as a whole have no inherent meaning early hominids may have evolved capacities for similar nonsemantic purposes that were later modified for symbolic language

V hyperintensities refer to areas of high intensity on types of magnetic resonance imaging mri scans of the human brain or that of other mammals these small regions of high intensity are observed on t2 weighted mri images typically created using 3d flair within cerebral white matter white matter lesions white matter hyperintensities or wmh  or subcortical gray matter gray matter hyperintensities or gmh they are usually seen in normal aging but also in a number of neurological disorders and psychiatric illnesses for example deep white matter hyperintensites are 25 to 3 times more likely to occur in bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder than control subjects   wmh volume calculated as a potential diagnostic measure has been shown to correlate to certain cognitive factors  hyperintensities appear as bright signals bright areas on an mri image and the term bright signal is occasionally used as a synonym for a hyperintensity hyperintensities are commonly divided into 3 types depending on the region of the brain where they are found deep white matter hyperintensites occur deep within white matter periventricular white matter hyperintensities occur adjacent to the lateral ventricles and subcortical hyperintensities occur in the basal ganglia  hyperintensities are often seen in auto immune diseases that have effect on the brain  postmortem studies combined with mri suggest that hyperintensities are dilated perivascular spaces or demyelination caused by reduced local blood flow    white matter hyperintensities can be caused by a variety of factors including ischemia microhemorrhages gliosis damage to small blood vessel walls breaches of the barrier between the barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain or loss and deformation of the myelin sheath  in most elderly people presence of severe wmh and medial temporal lobe atrophy mta was linked with an increase in frequency of mild cognitive deficits studies suggest that a combination of mta and severe wmh showed more than a fourfold increase in the frequency of mild cognitive deficits  its also been consistently shown that severe wmh is known to be associated with gait disorders impaired balance and cognitive disturbances certain features of gait pattern associated with wmh are slight widening of the base slowing and shortening of stride length and turning en bloc speed of cognitive processes and frontal skills may also be impaired in people with wmh   pathological signs of oligodendritic apoptosis and damage to axonal projections have been evident sufficient damage to the axons that course through wmh can cause adequate interference with normal neuronal functions  it is also thought that wmh patients have a negative impact on cognition in alzheimers disease population in alzheimers patients higher whm are associated with higher amyloid beta deposits possibly associated with small vessel disease and reduced amyloid beta clearance

V acute kidney injury aki previously called acute renal failure arf   is an abrupt loss of kidney function that develops within 7 days  its causes are numerous generally it occurs because of damage to the kidney tissue caused by decreased renal blood flow renal ischemia from any cause eg low blood pressure exposure to substances harmful to the kidney an inflammatory process in the kidney or an obstruction of the urinary tract which impedes the flow of urine aki is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic laboratory findings such as elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine or inability of the kidneys to produce sufficient amounts of urine aki may lead to a number of complications including metabolic acidosis high potassium levels uremia changes in body fluid balance and effects on other organ systems including death people who have experienced aki may have an increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the future management includes treatment of the underlying cause and supportive care such as renal replacement therapy   the clinical picture is often dominated by the underlying cause eg postoperative state the symptoms of acute kidney injury result from the various disturbances of kidney function that are associated with the disease accumulation of urea and other nitrogencontaining substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms such as fatigue loss of appetite headache nausea and vomiting  marked increases in the potassium level can lead to irregularities in the heartbeat which can be severe and lifethreatening  fluid balance is frequently affected though blood pressure can be high low or normal  pain in the flanks may be encountered in some conditions such as thrombosis of the renal blood vessels or inflammation of the kidney this is the result of stretching of the fibrous tissue capsule surrounding the kidney  if the kidney injury is the result of dehydration there may be thirst as well as evidence of fluid depletion on physical examination  physical examination may also provide other clues as to the underlying cause of the kidney problem such as a rash in interstitial nephritis or vasculitis and a palpable bladder in obstructive nephropathy  aki can be caused by systemic disease such as a manifestation of an autoimmune disease eg lupus nephritis crush injury contrast agents some antibiotics and more it is often multifactorial the most common cause is dehydration and sepsis combined with nephrotoxic drugs especially following surgery or contrast agents the causes of acute kidney injury are commonly categorized into prerenal intrinsic and postrenal prerenal causes of aki prerenal azotemia are those that decrease effective blood flow to the kidney these include systemic causes such as low blood volume low blood pressure heart failure liver cirrhosis and local changes to the blood vessels supplying the kidney the latter include renal artery stenosis or the narrowing of the renal artery which supplies the kidney with blood and renal vein thrombosis which is the formation of a blood clot in the renal vein that drains blood from the kidney renal ischaemia can result in depression of gfr causes include inadequate cardiac output and hypovolemia or vascular diseases causing reduced perfusion of both kidneys both kidneys need to be affected as one kidney is still more than adequate for normal kidney function sources of damage to the kidney itself are dubbed intrinsic intrinsic aki can be due to damage to the glomeruli renal tubules or interstitium common causes of each are glomerulonephritis acute tubular necrosis atn and acute interstitial nephritis ain respectively other causes of intrinsic aki are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome  postrenal aki is a consequence of urinary tract obstruction this may be related to benign prostatic hyperplasia kidney stones obstructed urinary catheter bladder stone bladder ureteral or renal malignancy it is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out urinary retention in post void residual a catheter is inserted immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder 50100ml suggests neurogenic bladder dysfunction a renal ultrasound will demonstrate hydronephrosis if present a ct scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis however in aki the use of iv contrast is contraindicated as the contrast agent used is nephrotoxic on the basic metabolic panel the ratio of bun to creatinine may indicate post renal failure the deterioration of renal function may be discovered by a measured decrease in urine output often it is diagnosed on the basis of blood tests for substances normally eliminated by the kidney urea and creatinine both tests have their disadvantages for instance it takes about 24 hours for the creatinine level to rise even if both kidneys have ceased to function a number of alternative markers has been proposed such as ngal kim1 il18 and cystatin c but none are currently established enough to replace creatinine as a marker of renal function  use of the renal angina index a composite of risk factors and early signs of injury has been used to detect fulfillment of renal angina in children once the diagnosis of aki is made further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause these may include urine sediment analysis renal ultrasound andor renal biopsy indications for renal biopsy in the setting of aki include  acute kidney injury is diagnosed on the basis of clinical history and laboratory data a diagnosis is made when there is rapid reduction in kidney function as measured by serum creatinine or based on a rapid reduction in urine output termed oliguria less than 400 mls of urine per 24 hours introduced by the kdigo in 2012  specific criteria exist for the diagnosis of aki aki can be diagnosed if any one of the following is present the rifle criteria proposed by the acute dialysis quality initiative adqi group aid in the staging of patients with aki   the management of aki hinges on identification and treatment of the underlying cause the main objectives of initial management are 1 to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death and 2 to call for specialist advice in addition to treatment of the underlying disorder management of aki routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys called nephrotoxins these include nsaids such as ibuprofen iodinated contrasts such as those used for ct scans many antibiotics such as gentamicin and a range of other substances  monitoring of renal function by serial serum creatinine measurements and monitoring of urine output is routinely performed in the hospital insertion of a urinary catheter helps monitor urine output and relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction such as with an enlarged prostate in prerenal aki without fluid overload administration of intravenous fluids is typically the first step to improve renal function volume status may be monitored with the use of a central venous catheter to avoid over or underreplacement of fluid should low blood pressure prove a persistent problem in the fluidreplete patient inotropes such as norepinephrine and dobutamine may be given to improve cardiac output and hence renal perfusion while a useful pressor there is no evidence to suggest that dopamine is of any specific benefit  and may be harmful the myriad causes of intrinsic aki require specific therapies for example intrinsic aki due to vasculitis or glomerulonephritis may respond to steroid medication cyclosphosphamide and in some cases plasma exchange toxininduced prerenal aki often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent such as ace inhibitors arb antagonists aminoglycosides penicillins nsaids or paracetamol  if the cause is obstruction of the urinary tract relief of the obstruction with a nephrostomy or urinary catheter may be necessary the use of diuretics such as furosemide is widespread and sometimes convenient in ameliorating fluid overload it is not associated with higher mortality risk of death  nor with any reduced mortality or length of intensive care unit or hospital stay  renal replacement therapy such as with hemodialysis may be instituted in some cases of aki a systematic review of the literature in 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes between the use of intermittent hemodialysis and continuous venovenous hemofiltration cvvh  among critically ill patients intensive renal replacement therapy with cvvh does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent hemodialysis   metabolic acidosis hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema may require medical treatment with sodium bicarbonate antihyperkalemic measures and diuretics lack of improvement with fluid resuscitation therapyresistant hyperkalemia metabolic acidosis or fluid overload may necessitate artificial support in the form of dialysis or hemofiltration  mortality remains high overall it is 20 30 if the patient is referred to nephrology 50 if dialysed and 70 if on itu depending on the cause a proportion of patients 510 will never regain full renal function thus entering endstage kidney failure and requiring lifelong dialysis or a kidney transplant patients with aki are more likely to die prematurely after being discharged from hospital even if their kidney function has recovered  the risk of developing chronic kidney disease is increased 88fold  new cases of aki are unusual but not rare affecting approximately 01 of the uk population per year 2000 ppmyear 20x incidence of new eskd aki requiring dialysis 10 of these is rare 200 ppmyear 2x incidence of new eskd  acute kidney injury is common among hospitalized patients it affects some 37 of patients admitted to the hospital and approximately 2530 of patients in the intensive care unit  acute renal failure was one of the most expensive conditions seen in us hospitals in 2011 with an aggregated cost of nearly 47 billion for approximately 498000 hospital stays  this was a 346 increase in hospitalizations from 1997 when there were 98000 acute renal failure stays  according to a review article of 2015 there has been an increase in cases of acute kidney injury in the last 20 years which cannot be explained solely by changes to the manner of reporting  before the advancement of modern medicine acute kidney injury was referred to as uremic poisoning while uremia was contamination of the blood with urine starting around 1847 uremia came to be used for reduced urine output a condition now called oliguria which was thought to be caused by the urines mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra  acute kidney injury due to acute tubular necrosis atn was recognised in the 1940s in the united kingdom where crush injury victims during the london blitz developed patchy necrosis of renal tubules leading to a sudden decrease in renal function  during the korean and vietnam wars the incidence of aki decreased due to better acute management and administration of intravenous fluids

V a mammary gland is an organ in female mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring mammals get their name from the word mammary in humans the mammary glands are situated in the breasts in ruminants such as cows goats and deer the mammary glands are contained in the udders the mammary glands of mammals other than primates such as dogs and cats are sometimes called dugs   the basic components of a mature mammary gland are the alveoli hollow cavities a few millimeters large lined with milksecreting cuboidal cells and surrounded by myoepithelial cells these alveoli join to form groups known as lobules each lobule has a lactiferous duct that drains into openings in the nipple the myoepithelial cells contract under the stimulation of oxytocin excreting the milk secreted by alveolar units into the lobule lumen toward the nipple as the infant begins to suck the oxytocinmediated let down reflex ensues and the mothers milk is secreted not sucked from the gland into the babys mouth all the milksecreting tissue leading to a single lactiferous duct is called a simple mammary gland in a complex mammary gland all the simple mammary glands serve one nipple humans normally have two complex mammary glands one in each breast and each complex mammary gland consists of 1020 simple glands the presence of more than two nipples is known as polythelia and the presence of more than two complex mammary glands as polymastia maintaining the correct polarized morphology of the lactiferous duct tree requires another essential component  mammary epithelial cells extracellular matrix ecm which together with adipocytes fibroblast inflammatory cells and others constitute mammary stroma  mammary epithelial ecm mainly contains myoepithelial basement membrane and the connective tissue they not only help to support mammary basic structure but also serve as a communicating bridge between mammary epithelia and their local and global environment throughout this organs development   a mammary gland is a specific type of apocrine gland specialized for manufacture of colostrum when giving birth mammary glands can be identified as apocrine because they exhibit striking decapitation secretion many sources assert that mammary glands are modified sweat glands    some authors dispute that and argue instead that they are sebaceous glands  mammary glands develop during different growth cycles they exist in both sexes during embryonic stage forming only a rudimentary duct tree at birth in this stage mammary gland development depends on systemic and maternal hormones  but is also under the local regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormonerelated protein pthrp  this locally secreted factor gives rise to a series of outsidein and insideout positive feedback between these two types of cells so that mammary bud epithelial cells can proliferate and sprout down into the mesenchymal layer until they reach the fat pad to begin the first round of branching  at the same time the embryonic mesenchymal cells around the epithelial bud receive secreting factors activated by pthrp such as bmp4 these mesenchymal cells can transform into a dense mammaryspecific mesenchyme which later develop into connective tissue with fibrous threads forming blood vessels and the lymph system  a basement membrane mainly containing laminin and collagen formed afterward by differentiated myoepithelial cells keeps the polarity of this primary duct tree estrogen and growth hormone gh are essential for the ductal component of mammary gland development and act synergistically to mediate it      neither estrogen nor gh are capable of inducing ductal development without the other     the role of gh in ductal development has been found to be mostly mediated by its induction of the secretion of insulinlike growth factor 1 igf1 which occurs both systemically mainly originating from the liver and locally in the mammary fat pad through activation of the growth hormone receptor ghr      however gh itself also acts independently of igf1 to stimulate ductal development by upregulating estrogen receptor er expression in mammary gland tissue which is a downstream effect of mammary gland ghr activation  in any case unlike igf1 gh itself is not essential for mammary gland development and igf1 in conjunction with estrogen can induce normal mammary gland development without the presence of gh  in addition to igf1 other paracrine growth factors such as epidermal growth factor egf transforming growth factor beta tgf\u03b2  amphiregulin  fibroblast growth factor fgf and hepatocyte growth factor hgf  are involved in breast development as mediators downstream to sex hormones and ghigf1    during embryonic development igf1 levels are low and gradually increase from birth to puberty  at puberty the levels of gh and igf1 reach their highest levels in life and estrogen begins to be secreted in high amounts in females which is when ductal development mostly takes place  under the influence of estrogen stromal and fat tissue surrounding the ductal system in the mammary glands also grows  after puberty gh and igf1 levels progressively decrease which limits further development until pregnancy if it occurs  during pregnancy progesterone and prolactin are essential for mediating lobuloalveolar development in estrogenprimed mammary gland tissue which occurs in preparation of lactation and nursing   androgens such as testosterone inhibit estrogenmediated mammary gland development eg by reducing local er expression through activation of androgen receptors expressed in mammary gland tissue   and in conjunction with relatively low estrogen levels are the cause of the lack of developed mammary glands in males  mammary gland development is characterized by the unique process by which the epithelium invades the stroma the development of the mammary gland occurs mainly after birth during puberty tubule formation is coupled with branching morphogenesis which establishes the basic arboreal network of ducts emanating from the nipple  developmentally mammary gland epithelium is constantly produced and maintained by rare epithelial cells dubbed as mammary progenitors which are ultimately thought to be derived from tissueresident stem cells  embryonic mammary gland development can be divided into a series of specific stages initially the formation of the milk lines that run between the fore and hind limbs bilaterally on each side of the midline occurs around embryonic day 105 e105 the second stage occurs at e115 when placode formation begins along the mammary milk line this will eventually give rise to the nipple lastly the third stage occurs at e125 and involves the invagination of cells within the placode into the mesenchyme leading to a mammary anlage biology  the primitive stem cells are detected in embryo and their numbers increase steadily during development   postnatally the mammary ducts elongate into the mammary fat pad then starting around four weeks of age mammary ductal growth increases significantly with the ducts invading towards the lymph node terminal end buds the highly proliferative structures found at the tips of the invading ducts expand and increase greatly during this stage this developmental period is characterized by the emergence of the terminal end buds and lasts until an age of about 78 weeks by the pubertal stage the mammary ducts have invaded to the end of the mammary fat pad at this point the terminal end buds become less proliferative and decrease in size side branches form from the primary ducts and begin to fill the mammary fat pad ductal development decreases with the arrival of sexual maturity and undergoes estrous cycles proestrus estrus metestrus and diestrus as a result of estrous cycling the mammary gland undergoes dynamic changes where cells proliferate and then regress in an ordered fashion  during pregnancy the ductal systems undergo rapid proliferation and form alveolar structures within the branches to be used for milk production after delivery lactation occurs within the mammary gland lactation involves the secretion of milk by the luminal cells in the alveoli contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli will cause the milk to be ejected through the ducts and into the nipple for the nursing infant upon weaning of the infant lactation stops and the mammary gland turns in on itself a process called involution this process involves the controlled collapse of mammary epithelial cells where cells begin apoptosis in a controlled manner reverting the mammary gland back to a pubertal state during postmenopause due to much lower levels of estrogen and due to lower levels of gh and igf1 which decrease with age mammary gland tissue atrophies and the mammary glands become smaller lactiferous duct development occurs in females in response to circulating hormones first development is frequently seen during pre and postnatal stages and later during puberty estrogen promotes branching differentiation  whereas in males testosterone inhibits it a mature duct tree reaching the limit of the fat pad of the mammary gland comes into being by bifurcation of duct terminal end buds teb secondary branches sprouting from primary ducts   and proper duct lumen formation these processes are tightly modulated by components of mammary epithelial ecm interacting with systemic hormones and local secreting factors however for each mechanism the epithelial cells niche can be delicately unique with different membrane receptor profiles and basement membrane thickness from specific branching area to area so as to regulate cell growth or differentiation sublocally  important players include beta1 integrin epidermal growth factor receptor egfr laminin15 collageniv matrix metalloproteinasemmps heparan sulfate proteoglycans and others elevated circulating level of growth hormone and estrogen get to multipotent cap cells on teb tips through a thin leaky layer of basement membrane these hormones promote specific gene expression hence cap cells can differentiate into myoepithelial and luminal duct epithelial cells and the increased amount of activated mmps can degrade surrounding ecm helping duct buds to reach further in the fat pads   on the other hand basement membrane along the mature mammary ducts is thicker with strong adhesion to epithelial cells via binding to integrin and nonintegrin receptors when side branches develop it is a much more pushingforward working process including extending through myoepithelial cells degrading basement membrane and then invading into a periductal layer of fibrous stromal tissue  degraded basement membrane fragments laminin5 roles to lead the way of mammary epithelial cells migration  whereas laminin1 interacts with nonintegrin receptor dystroglycan negatively regulates this side branching process in case of cancer  these complex yinyang balancing crosstalks between mammary ecm and epithelial cells instruct healthy mammary gland development until adult there is preliminary evidence that soybean intake mildly stimulates the breast glands in pre and postmenopausal women  secretory alveoli develop mainly in pregnancy when rising levels of prolactin estrogen and progesterone cause further branching together with an increase in adipose tissue and a richer blood flow in gestation serum progesterone remains at a stably high concentration so signaling through its receptor is continuously activated as one of the transcribed genes wnts secreted from mammary epithelial cells act paracrinely to induce more neighboring cells branching   when the lactiferous duct tree is almost ready leaves alveoli are differentiated from luminal epithelial cells and added at the end of each branch in late pregnancy and for the first few days after giving birth colostrum is secreted milk secretion lactation begins a few days later due to reduction in circulating progesterone and the presence of another important hormone prolactin which mediates further alveologenesis milk protein production and regulates osmotic balance and tight junction function laminin and collagen in myoepithelial basement membrane interacting with beta1 integrin on epithelial surface again is essential in this process   their binding ensures correct placement of prolactin receptors on the basal lateral side of alveoli cells and directional secretion of milk into lactiferous ducts   suckling of the baby causes release of the hormone oxytocin which stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells in this combined control from ecm and systemic hormones milk secretion can be reciprocally amplified so as to provide enough nutrition for the baby during weaning decreased prolactin missing mechanical stimulation baby suckling and changes in osmotic balance caused by milk stasis and leaking of tight junctions cause cessation of milk production its the passive process of a child or animal ceasing to be dependant on the mother for nourishment in some species there is complete or partial involution of alveolar structures after weaning in humans there is only partial involution and the level of involution in humans appears to be highly individual the glands in the breast do secrete fluid also in nonlactating women  in some other species such as cows all alveoli and secretory duct structures collapse by programmed cell death apoptosis and autophagy for lack of growth promoting factors either from the ecm or circulating hormones   at the same time apoptosis of blood capillary endothelial cells speeds up the regression of lactation ductal beds shrinkage of the mammary duct tree and ecm remodeling by various proteinase is under the control of somatostatin and other growth inhibiting hormones and local factors  this major structural change leads loose fat tissue to fill the empty space afterward but a functional lactiferous duct tree can be formed again when a female is pregnant again tumorigenesis in mammary glands can be induced biochemically by abnormal expression level of circulating hormones or local ecm components  or from a mechanical change in the tension of mammary stroma  under either of the two circumstances mammary epithelial cells would grow out of control and eventually result in cancer almost all instances of breast cancer originate in the lobules or ducts of the mammary glands the constantly protruding breasts of the adult human female unusually large relative to body size are a unique evolutionary development whose purpose is not yet fully known see breast other mammals tend to have less conspicuous mammary glands that protrude only while actually filling with milk the number and positioning of complex and simple mammary glands varies widely in different mammals the nipples and glands can occur anywhere along the two milk lines two nearly parallel lines along the ventral aspect of the body in general most mammals develop mammary glands in pairs along these lines with a number approximating the number of young typically birthed at a time the number of nipples varies from 2 in most primates to 18 in pigs the virginia opossum has 13 one of the few mammals with an odd number   the following table lists the number and position of glands normally found in a range of mammals male mammals typically have rudimentary mammary glands and nipples with a few exceptions male mice do not have nipples  and male horses lack nipples and mammary glands  the male dayak fruit bat has lactating mammary glands  male lactation occurs infrequently in some species including humans mammary glands are true protein factories and several labs have constructed transgenic animals mainly goats and cows to produce proteins for pharmaceutical use  complex glycoproteins such as monoclonal antibodies or antithrombin cannot be produced by genetically engineered bacteria and the production in live mammals is much cheaper than the use of mammalian cell cultures the evolution of the mammary gland is difficult to explain this is because mammary glands are typically required by mammals to feed their young there are many theories on how mammary glands evolved for example it is believed that the mammary gland is a transformed sweat gland more closely related to apocrine sweat glands  since mammary glands do not fossilize well supporting such theories with fossil evidence is difficult many of the current theories are based on comparisons between lines of living mammals  monotremes marsupials and eutherians one theory proposes that mammary glands evolved from glands that were used to keep the eggs of early mammals moist   and free from infection   monotremes still lay eggs other theories suggest that early secretions were used directly by hatched young  or that the secretions were used by young to help them orient to their mothers  lactation is thought to have developed long before the evolution of the mammary gland and mammals see evolution

V erotic lactation is sexual arousal by breastfeeding on a females breast depending on the context the practice can also be referred to as adult suckling adult nursing and adult breastfeeding practitioners sometimes refer to themselves as being in an adult nursing relationship anr  two persons in an exclusive relationship can be called a nursing couple though this term is also sometimes used for a mother and her child milk fetishism and lactophilia are medical diagnostic terms for paraphilias and are used for disorders according to the precise criteria of icd10 and dsmiv    breasts and especially nipples are highly erogenous zones for both men and women nipple and breast stimulation of women are a nearuniversal aspect of human sexuality though nipples in males are not as sexualized  humans are the only primates whose females have permanently enlarged breasts after the onset of puberty the breasts of other primate species are enlarged only during pregnancy and nursing one hypothesis postulates that the breasts grew as a frontal counterpart to the buttocks when primates became upright thus attracting males a theory first developed in 1967  another hypothesis suggests that breasts provide an unfakeable and sexually stimulating indicator of maidenhood with which women compete through sexual selection for mates  other theories include that by chance breasts act as a cushion for infant heads are a signal of fertility or elevate the infants head in breastfeeding to prevent suffocation  paradoxically there is even a school that believes that they are an evolutionary flaw and can actually suffocate a nursing infant  the association of pleasure and nutrition holds true as well for the lips also erogenous zones where pleasure may have led to kiss feeding in which mothers chew food before passing it on to the child  unintended milk flow galactorrhea is often caused by nipple stimulation and it is possible to reach normal milk production exclusively by suckling on the breast nipple stimulation of any sort is noted in reducing the incidence of breast cancer  some women lose the ability to be aroused while breastfeeding and thus would not find lactation with a sexual partner to be erotic this can be a result of physical reasons soreness or psychological reasons conflicted about her breasts being used other than for an infant  because female breasts and nipples are generally regarded as an important part of sexual activity in most cultures it is not uncommon that couples may proceed from oral stimulation of the nipples to actual breastfeeding  in lesbian partnerships mutual breastfeeding has been regarded as a familiar expression of affection and tenderness  in its issue of march 13 2005 the london weekly the sunday times gave a report of a scientific survey composed of 1690 british men revealing that in 25 to 33 of all couples the male partner had suckled his wifes breasts regularly the men gave a genuine emotional need as their motive  the breasts have two roles in human society nutritive and sexual  breastfeeding in general is considered by some to be mildly exhibitionary especially in western societies see breastfeeding in public breastfeeding mothers have faced legal ramifications for nursing their children into toddlerhood or in public or for photographing themselves while nursing  researcher nikki sullivan in her book a critical introduction to queer theory calls erotic lactation a manifestation of queer she defines queer as an ideology that is as a sort of vague and indefinable set of practices and political positions that has the potential to challenge normative knowledges and identities drawing on a statement of david halperin she continues since queer is a positionality rather than an identity in the humanist sense it is not restricted to gays and lesbians but can be taken up by anyone who feels marginalised as a result of their sexual practices the heteronormative profile of breastfeeding assumes certain norms additionally any relevant third party is assumed to be the mothers significant other and this person is regulated to a supportive role to maximise the breastfeeding mothers success  the following are various methods people employ to practice erotic lactation they are listed according to prevalence in decreasing order erotic lactation between partners or an adult nursing relationship anr may develop from natural breastfeeding of a baby during the lactation period the partner starts to suckle on the female breast and continues after the baby is weaned off milk production is continually stimulated and the milk flow continues according to the book body parts critical explorations in corporeality adult nursing may occur when an individual usually a mother may choose to continue lactating after weaning a child so that she avoids the significant physical challenge that inducing lactation can entail  however milk production can be artificially and intentionally induced in the absence of any pregnancy in the woman this is called induced lactation while a woman who has lactated before and restarts is said to relactate this can be done by regularly sucking on the nipples several times a day massaging and squeezing the female breasts or with additional help from temporary use of milkinducing drugs such as the dopamine antagonist domperidone   in principlewith considerable patience and perseveranceit is possible to induce lactation by sucking on the nipples alone it is not necessary that the woman has ever been pregnant and she can be well in her postmenopausal period once established lactation adjusts to demand as long as there is regular breast stimulation lactation is possible  though birth is the beginning of the separation between mother and child breastfeeding slows this process making the mother and infant connect physically continually sometimes for years  as a source of nourishment the immediacy of this connection is intensified breastfeeding has a sexual element as a result of physiological factors in a study conducted in 1999 approximately 33 to 50 percent of mothers found breast feeding erotic and among them 25 percent felt guilty because of this  this study corroborated a study in 1949 that found that in a few cases where the arousal was strong enough to induce orgasm some nursing mothers abandoned breastfeeding altogether  in a 1988 questionnaire on orgasm and pregnancy published in a dutch magazine for women when asked did you experience while breastfeeding a sensation of sexual excitement 34 percent or 153 total answered in the affirmative an additional 71 percent answered in the affirmative when asked did you experience while breastfeeding pleasurable contractions in the uterine region  since the european middle ages a multitude of subliminally erotic visionary experiences of saints have been passed on in which breastfeeding plays a major role one prominent example is the lactatio of saint bernard of clairvaux  roman charity or caritas romana  is a story of a woman pero who secretly breastfeeds her father cimon after he is incarcerated and sentenced to death by starvation she is found out by a jailer but her act of selflessness impresses officials and wins her fathers release the story comes from the roman writer valerius maximus in the years ad 14ad 37 in about ad 1362 the story was retold by the famous writer giovanni boccaccio  after boccaccio hundreds or possibly thousands of paintings were created which tell the story a variant of this story can be found at the conclusion of john steinbecks 1939 novel the grapes of wrath primarily the story tells of a conflict an existing taboo implied incest and adult breastfeeding of a womans milk or saving a life by breaking the taboo in this aspect there is no erotic focus to the story valerius maximus tells another story about a woman breastfeeding her mother which is followed by the very short story of a woman breastfeeding her father the second fatherdaughter story in fact consists of one sentence only thirteen hundred years later boccaccio retells the first motherdaughter story and does not mention the fatherdaughter story and the first is apparently forgotten leading to nearly all caritas romana oil paintings and drawings showing only the fatherdaughter story  adult suckling was used to treat ailing adults and treat illnesses including eye disease and pulmonary tuberculosis  the writer thomas moffat recorded one physicians use of a wet nurse in a tome first published in 1655   in traditional islamic law someone who suckles the breast of a woman who is less than 2 years old  besides many strict rules like that the suckling should be of such quantity that it could be said that the bones of the child were strengthened and the flesh allowed to grow and if that cannot be ascertained then if a child suckles for one full day and night or if it suckles fifteen times to its fill it will be sufficient  is that womans child through a foster relationship the woman is then called milk mother however according to the jurist abussuud c14901574 this only applies to sucklings under the age of two and a half years  also according to ayatollah ali sistani a highly praised scholar for the shia muslims the child should not have completed two years of his age  the same latter source states at least 8 conditions that should apply before that child is considered a sondaughter of the feeding woman a modern saudi jurist in 1983 upheld that if a man suckles from his wife their marriage is nullified  the query remains a popular one into the 21st century and has come up in saudi advice columns  a sunni cleric sheik ezzat atiya \u0639\u0632\u062a \u0639\u0637\u064a\u0629 president of the hadith department of egypts alazhar university issued a fatwa in 2007 encouraging women to breastfeed their male business colleagues so that the man could become symbolically related to the woman thereby precluding any sexual relations and the need for both sexes to observe modesty breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting it was later denounced and declared defamatory to islam  in 2013 a domestic staff agency in china named xinxinyu was reported to be providing wet nurses for the sick and other adults as well as for newborns the agencys clients could choose to drink the breast milk directly from the breast or to drink it via a breast pump the reports caused controversy in china with one writer describing it as adding to chinas problem of treating women as consumer goods and the moral degradation of chinas rich the agency was forced to suspend its operations by chinese authorities for a number of reasons one of which was for missing three years of annual checks  in 1903 german philosopher carl buttenstedt published his marriage guidebook die glücksehe  die offenbarung im weibe eine naturstudie the marriage of happiness  the revelation in the woman a study from nature in which he described and recommended the lactational amenorrhea method lam as a form of contraception and natural family planning that also deepens the relationship between wife and husband he explicitly described erotic lactation as a source of great sexual pleasure for both partners claiming that this is intended by nature especially on the part of the woman this particular aspect of his broader general marriage philosophy gained a lot of attention and sparked wide debate while some welcomed buttenstedts advice as inspirational for new ways to improve sexual satisfaction between marriage partners others warned that this technique could pathologically increase sexual sensation of both partners  consequently the book was banned by the nazis in 1938  the bonyu bar mothers milk bar located tokyos entertainment and redlight district of kabukicho employs nursing women who provide customers with breast milk in a glass for 2000 yen about 15 euros or directly from the nipple for 5000 yen about 3750 euros in the latter case the women can run their fingers through the customers hair coo and say their name as they suckle

V the thalamus from greek \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 chamber  is a midline symmetrical structure of two halves within the vertebrate brain situated between the cerebral cortex and the midbrain some of its functions are the relaying of sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex   and the regulation of consciousness sleep and alertness the two parts of the thalamus surround the third ventricle it is the main product of the embryonic diencephalon   the thalamus is located in the forebrain superior to the midbrain near the center of the brain with nerve fibers projecting out to the cerebral cortex in all directions the medial surface of the thalamus constitutes the upper part of the lateral wall of the third ventricle and is connected to the corresponding surface of the opposite thalamus by a flattened gray band the interthalamic adhesion the two halves of the thalamus are prominent bulbshaped masses about 57cm in length located obliquely about 30 and symmetrically on each side of the third ventricle  both parts of the thalamus in the human are about the size and shape of a walnut  these are about three centimetres in length at the widest part 25 centimetres across and about 2 centimetres in height comparable to an unshelled walnut with the nutshell joining in the horizontal plane the thalamus derives its blood supply from a number of arteries the polar artery posterior communicating artery paramedian thalamicsubthalamic arteries inferolateral thalamogeniculate arteries and posterior medial and lateral choroidal arteries  these are all branches of the posterior cerebral artery  some people have the artery of percheron which is a rare anatomic variation in which a single arterial trunk arises from the posterior cerebral artery to supply both parts of the thalamus the thalamus is part of a nuclear complex structured of four parts the hypothalamus epithalamus prethalamus formerly called ventral thalamus and dorsal thalamus  derivatives of the diencephalon also include the dorsallylocated epithalamus essentially the habenula and annexes and the perithalamus prethalamus containing the zona incerta and the thalamic reticular nucleus due to their different ontogenetic origins the epithalamus and the perithalamus are formally distinguished from the thalamus proper the thalamus comprises a system of lamellae made up of myelinated fibers separating different thalamic subparts other areas are defined by distinct clusters of neurons such as the periventricular nucleus the intralaminar elements the nucleus limitans and others  these latter structures different in structure from the major part of the thalamus have been grouped together into the allothalamus as opposed to the isothalamus  this distinction simplifies the global description of the thalamus the thalamus is manifoldly connected to the hippocampus via the mammillothalamic tract this tract comprises the mammilary body and fornix  the thalamus is connected to the cerebral cortex via the thalamocortical radiations  the spinothalamic tract is a sensory pathway originating in the spinal cord it transmits information to the thalamus about pain temperature itch and crude touch there are two main parts the lateral spinothalamic tract which transmits pain and temperature and the anterior or ventral spinothalamic tract which transmits crude touch and pressure the thalamus has multiple functions it may be thought of as a kind of hub of information it is generally believed to act as a relay between different subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex in particular every sensory system with the exception of the olfactory system includes a thalamic nucleus that receives sensory signals and sends them to the associated primary cortical area for the visual system for example inputs from the retina are sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus which in turn projects to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe the thalamus is believed to both process sensory information as well as relay iteach of the primary sensory relay areas receives strong feedback connections from the cerebral cortex similarly the medial geniculate nucleus acts as a key auditory relay between the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and the primary auditory cortex and the ventral posterior nucleus is a key somatosensory relay which sends touch and proprioceptive information to the primary somatosensory cortex the thalamus also plays an important role in regulating states of sleep and wakefulness  thalamic nuclei have strong reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex forming thalamocorticothalamic circuits that are believed to be involved with consciousness the thalamus plays a major role in regulating arousal the level of awareness and activity damage to the thalamus can lead to permanent coma the role of the thalamus in the more anterior pallidal and nigral territories in the basal ganglia system disturbances is recognized but still poorly understood the contribution of the thalamus to vestibular or to tectal functions is almost ignored the thalamus has been thought of as a relay that simply forwards signals to the cerebral cortex newer research suggests that thalamic function is more selective  many different functions are linked to various regions of the thalamus this is the case for many of the sensory systems except for the olfactory system such as the auditory somatic visceral gustatory and visual systems where localized lesions provoke specific sensory deficits a major role of the thalamus is support of motor and language systems and much of the circuitry implicated for these systems is shared the thalamus is functionally connected to the hippocampus  as part of the extended hippocampal system at the thalamic anterior nuclei  with respect to spatial memory and spatial sensory datum they are crucial for human episodic memory and rodent event memory   there is support for the hypothesis that thalamic regions connection to particular parts of the mesiotemporal lobe provide differentiation of the functioning of recollective and familiarity memory  the neuronal information processes necessary for motor control were proposed as a network involving the thalamus as a subcortical motor centre  through investigations of the anatomy of the brains of primates  the nature of the interconnected tissues of the cerebellum to the multiple motor cortices suggested that the thalamus fulfills a key function in providing the specific channels from the basal ganglia and cerebellum to the cortical motor areas   in an investigation of the saccade and antisaccade  motor response in three monkeys the thalamic regions were found to be involved in the generation of antisaccade eyemovement  the thalamic complex is composed of the perithalamus or prethalamus previously also known as ventral thalamus the middiencephalic organiser which forms later the zona limitans intrathalamica zli  and the thalamus dorsal thalamus   the development of the thalamus can be subdivide into three steps  the thalamus is the largest structure deriving from the embryonic diencephalon the posterior part of the forebrain situated between the midbrain and the cerebrum after neurulation the anlage of the prethalamus and the thalamus is induced within the neural tube data from different vertebrate model organisms support a model in which the interaction between two transcription factors fez and otx are of decisive importance fez is expressed in the prethalamus and functional experiments show that fez is required for prethalamus formation   posteriorly otx1 and otx2 abut the expression domain of fez and are required for proper development of the thalamus   at the interface between the expression domains of fez and otx the middiencephalic organizer mdo also called the zli organiser is induced within the thalamic anlage the mdo is the central signalling organizer in the thalamus a lack of the organizer leads to the absence of the thalamus the mdo matures from ventral to dorsal during development members of the shh family and of the wnt family are the main principal signals emitted by the mdo besides its importance as signalling center the organizer matures into the morphological structure of the zona limitans intrathalamica zli after its induction the mdo starts to orchestrate the development of the thalamic anlage by release of signalling molecules such as shh  in mice the function of signaling at the mdo has not been addressed directly due to a complete absence of the diencephalon in shh mutants  studies in chicks have shown that shh is both necessary and sufficient for thalamic gene induction  in zebrafish it was shown that the expression of two shh genes shha and shhb formerly described as twhh mark the mdo territory and that shh signaling is sufficient for the molecular differentiation of both the prethalamus and the thalamus but is not required for their maintenance and shh signaling from the mdoalar plate is sufficient for the maturation of prethalamic and thalamic territory while ventral shh signals are dispensable  the exposure to shh leads to differentiation of thalamic neurons shh signaling from the mdo induces a posteriortoanterior wave of expression the proneural gene neurogenin1 in the major caudal part of the thalamus and ascl1 formerly mash1 in the remaining narrow stripe of rostral thalamic cells immediately adjacent to the mdo and in the prethalamus   this zonation of proneural gene expression leads to the differentiation of glutamatergic relay neurons from the neurogenin1 precursors and of gabaergic inhibitory neurons from the ascl1 precursors in fish selection of these alternative neurotransmitter fates is controlled by the dynamic expression of her6 the homolog of hes1 expression of this hairylike bhlh transcription factor which represses neurogenin but is required for ascl1 is progressively lost from the caudal thalamus but maintained in the prethalamus and in the stripe of rostral thalamic cells in addition studies on chick and mice have shown that blocking the shh pathway leads to absence of the rostral thalamus and substantial decrease of the caudal thalamus the rostral thalamus will give rise to the reticular nucleus mainly whereby the caudal thalamus will form the relay thalamus and will be further subdivided in the thalamic nuclei  in humans a common genetic variation in the promotor region of the serotonin transporter the sertlong and short allele 5httlpr has been shown to affect the development of several regions of the thalamus in adults people who inherit two short alleles sertss have more neurons and a larger volume in the pulvinar and possibly the limbic regions of the thalamus enlargement of the thalamus provides an anatomical basis for why people who inherit two sertss alleles are more vulnerable to major depression posttraumatic stress disorder and suicide  a cerebrovascular accident stroke can lead to the thalamic syndrome  which involves a onesided burning or aching sensation often accompanied by mood swings bilateral ischemia of the area supplied by the paramedian artery can cause serious problems including akinetic mutism and be accompanied by oculomotor problems a related concept is thalamocortical dysrhythmia the occlusion of the artery of percheron can lead to a bilateral thalamus infarction korsakoffs syndrome stems from damage to the mammillary body the mammillothalamic fasciculus or the thalamus fatal familial insomnia is a hereditary prion disease in which degeneration of the thalamus occurs causing the patient to gradually lose his ability to sleep and progressing to a state of total insomnia which invariably leads to death in contrast damage to the thalamus can result in coma images are circa 1858  the left optic nerve and the optic tracts coronal section of lateral and 3rd ventricles dissection showing the

V the brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals only a few invertebrates such as sponges jellyfish adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead the brain is located in the head usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision hearing balance taste and smell the brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrates body in a typical human the cerebral cortex the largest part is estimated to contain 1533 billion neurons  each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons these neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells physiologically the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body the brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones this centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain the operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved  recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer very different in mechanism from an electronic computer but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world stores it and processes it in a variety of ways analogous to the central processing unit cpu in a computer this article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species with the greatest attention to vertebrates it deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains the ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context the most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage covered in the human brain article because the most common diseases of the human brain either do not show up in other species or else manifest themselves in different ways   the shape and size of the brain varies greatly in different species and identifying common features is often difficult  nevertheless there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species  some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species  others distinguish advanced brains from more primitive ones or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates  the simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives and then sliced apart for examination of the interior visually the interior of the brain consists of areas of socalled grey matter with a dark color separated by areas of white matter with a lighter color further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations it is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another  the brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells neurons and glial cells glial cells also known as glia or neuroglia come in several types and perform a number of critical functions including structural support metabolic support insulation and guidance of development neurons however are usually considered the most important cells in the brain  the property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances  they send these signals by means of an axon which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects usually with numerous branches to other areas sometimes nearby sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body the length of an axon can be extraordinary for example if a pyramidal cell an excitatory neuron of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body its axon equally magnified would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter extending more than a kilometer  these axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1100 meters per second some neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of 10100 per second usually in irregular patterns other neurons are quiet most of the time but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials  axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses a single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells  when an action potential traveling along an axon arrives at a synapse it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released the neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell  synapses are the key functional elements of the brain  the essential function of the brain is celltocell communication and synapses are the points at which communication occurs the human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses  even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million  the functions of these synapses are very diverse some are excitatory exciting the target cell others are inhibitory others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways  a large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable that is they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them it is widely believed that activitydependent modification of synapses is the brains primary mechanism for learning and memory  most of the space in the brain is taken up by axons which are often bundled together in what are called nerve fiber tracts a myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of myelin which serves to greatly increase the speed of signal propagation there are also unmyelinated axons myelin is white making parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as lightcolored white matter in contrast to the darkercolored grey matter that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies  except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges which have no nervous system  and cnidarians which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve net  all living multicellular animals are bilaterians meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape that is left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other  all bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the cambrian period 485540 million years ago and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body  at a schematic level that basic wormshape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians including vertebrates  the fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus and a nerve cord with an enlargement a ganglion for each body segment with an especially large ganglion at the front called the brain the brain is small and simple in some species such as nematode worms in other species including vertebrates it is the most complex organ in the body  some types of worms such as leeches also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord known as a tail brain  there are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain including echinoderms tunicates and acoelomorphs a group of primitive flatworms it has not been definitively established whether the existence of these brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure  this category includes arthropods molluscs and numerous types of worms the diversity of invertebrate body plans is matched by an equal diversity in brain structures  two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains arthropods insects crustaceans arachnids and others and cephalopods octopuses squids and similar molluscs  the brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing  cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates  there are several invertebrate species whose brains have been studied intensively because they have properties that make them convenient for experimental work the first vertebrates appeared over 500million years ago mya during the cambrian period and may have resembled the modern hagfish in form  sharks appeared about 450mya amphibians about 400mya reptiles about 350mya and mammals about 200mya each species has an equally long evolutionary history but the brains of modern hagfishes lampreys sharks amphibians reptiles and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence all of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components but many are rudimentary in the hagfish whereas in mammals the foremost part the telencephalon is greatly elaborated and expanded  brains are most simply compared in terms of their size the relationship between brain size body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species as a rule brain size increases with body size but not in a simple linear proportion in general smaller animals tend to have larger brains measured as a fraction of body size for mammals the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about 075  this formula describes the central tendency but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior for example primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts predators tend to have larger brains than their prey relative to body size  all vertebrate brains share a common underlying form which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development in its earliest form the brain appears as three swellings at the front end of the neural tube these swellings eventually become the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain the prosencephalon mesencephalon and rhombencephalon respectively at the earliest stages of brain development the three areas are roughly equal in size in many classes of vertebrates such as fish and amphibians the three parts remain similar in size in the adult but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts and the midbrain becomes very small  the brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue  living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside with subtle variations in color vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers the cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another forming the bloodbrain barrier which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens  though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain  neuroanatomists usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions the telencephalon cerebral hemispheres diencephalon thalamus and hypothalamus mesencephalon midbrain cerebellum pons and medulla oblongata each of these areas has a complex internal structure some parts such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space other parts such as the thalamus and hypothalamus consist of clusters of many small nuclei thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure chemistry and connectivity  although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry especially in the forebrain area the brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way but in teleost fishes the great majority of existing fish species the forebrain has become everted like a sock turned inside out in birds there are also major changes in forebrain structure  these distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species  here is a list of some of the most important vertebrate brain components along with a brief description of their functions as currently understood the most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size on average a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size  size however is not the only difference there are also substantial differences in shape the hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure  the cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals in nonmammalian vertebrates the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple threelayered structure called the pallium in mammals the pallium evolves into a complex sixlayered structure called neocortex or isocortex  several areas at the edge of the neocortex including the hippocampus and amygdala are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates  the elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas the superior colliculus which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates shrinks to a small size in mammals and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex  the cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion the neocerebellum dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex which has no counterpart in other vertebrates  the brains of humans and other primates contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals but are generally larger in proportion to body size  the most widely accepted way of comparing brain sizes across species is the socalled encephalization quotient eq which takes into account the nonlinearity of the braintobody relationship  humans have an average eq in the 7to8 range while most other primates have an eq in the 2to3 range dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans  but nearly all other mammals have eq values that are substantially lower most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex especially the prefrontal cortex and the parts of the cortex involved in vision  the visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas with a complex web of interconnections it has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex  the prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning working memory motivation attention and executive control it takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species and an especially large fraction of the human brain   the brain does not simply grow but rather develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages  it changes in shape from a simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages to a complex array of areas and connections neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations once neurons have positioned themselves their axons sprout and navigate through the brain branching and extending as they go until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections in a number of parts of the nervous system neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages and then the unneeded ones are pruned away  for vertebrates the early stages of neural development are similar across all species  as the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate the precursor of the nervous system the neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube a hollow cord of cells with a fluidfilled ventricle at the center at the front end the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain at the next stage the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon which will contain the cerebral cortex basal ganglia and related structures and the diencephalon which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus at about the same time the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon which will contain the cerebellum and pons and the myelencephalon which will contain the medulla oblongata each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated the resulting cells then migrate sometimes for long distances to their final positions  once a neuron is in place it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it axons because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets grow in a particularly complex way the tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone studded with chemical receptors these receptors sense the local environment causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path the result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses considering the entire brain thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding  the synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes though in many parts of the brain axons initially overgrow and then are pruned by mechanisms that depend on neural activity  in the projection from the eye to the midbrain for example the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping connecting each point on the surface of the retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer in the first stages of development each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons the retina before birth contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer these waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time that is they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons this information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken and eventually vanish if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell the result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map leaving it finally in its precise adult form  similar things happen in other brain areas an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance but then gradually refined by activitydependent mechanisms partly driven by internal dynamics partly by external sensory inputs in some cases as with the retinamidbrain system activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain and apparently exist solely to guide development  in humans and many other mammals new neurons are created mainly before birth and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain  there are however a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life the two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb which is involved in the sense of smell and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories with these exceptions however the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life glial cells are different as with most types of cells in the body they are generated throughout the lifespan  there has long been debate about whether the qualities of mind personality and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringingthis is the nature and nurture controversy  although many details remain to be settled neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important genes determine the general form of the brain and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience experience however is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does in some respects all that matters is the presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development  in other respects the quantity and quality of experience are important for example there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices indicating a higher density of synaptic connections than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted  the functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells the electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses  neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates themneurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapses target cell and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules with few exceptions each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter or combination of neurotransmitters at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons this rule is known as dales principle  thus a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems this applies to drugs such as cannabinoids nicotine heroin cocaine alcohol fluoxetine chlorpromazine and many others  the two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons and gammaaminobutyric acid gaba which is almost always inhibitory neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain  because of their ubiquity drugs that act on glutamate or gaba tend to have broad and powerful effects some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of gaba  there are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain often areas dedicated to a particular function serotonin for examplethe primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aidscomes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei  norepinephrine which is involved in arousal comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus  other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and gaba  as a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active when large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull using electroencephalography eeg  or magnetoencephalography meg eeg recordings along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active even during sleep  each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity which may vary according to behavioral state in mammals the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive and chaoticlooking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task during an epileptic seizure the brains inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels producing eeg traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain relating these populationlevel patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology  all vertebrates have a bloodbrain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons including levels of ions and nutrients  brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals the need to limit body weight in order for example to fly has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species such as bats  most of the brains energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge membrane potential of neurons  most vertebrate species devote between 2 and 8 of basal metabolism to the brain in primates however the percentage is much higherin humans it rises to 2025  the energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods pet fmri  and nirs  the brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygendependent metabolism of glucose ie blood sugar  but ketones provide a major alternative source together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids caprylic  and heptanoic  acids lactate  acetate  and possibly amino acids  from an evolutionarybiological perspective the function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal a centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be coactivated in complex patterns it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at crosspurposes to each other  to generate purposeful and unified action the brain first brings information from sense organs together at a central location it then processes this raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment next it combines the processed sensory information with information about the current needs of an animal and with memory of past circumstances finally on the basis of the results it generates motor response patterns that are suited to maximize the welfare of the animal these signalprocessing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems  the invention of electronic computers in the 1940s along with the development of mathematical information theory led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems this concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience  the earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise as for example in john von neumanns 1958 book the computer and the brain  over the years though accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism  the essence of the information processing approach is to try to understand brain function in terms of information flow and implementation of algorithms  one of the most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled what the frogs eye tells the frogs brain the paper examined the visual responses of neurons in the retina and optic tectum of frogs and came to the conclusion that some neurons in the tectum of the frog are wired to combine elementary responses in a way that makes them function as bug perceivers  a few years later david hubel and torsten wiesel discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in the field of viewa discovery for which they won a nobel prize  followup studies in higherorder visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity color movement and aspects of shape with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses  other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates some related to memory some to abstract types of cognition such as space  theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks which can be simulated using computers  some useful models are abstract focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are implemented in the brain other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons  no model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function though the essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperativelycurrent methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time  furthermore even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations  so brain models that dont reflect this are arguably too abstractive to be representative of brain operation models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources however having said this the human brain project is trying to build a realistic detailed computational model of the entire human brain it remains to be seen what level of success they can achieve in the time frame of the project and the wisdom of it has been publicly contested with highprofile scientists on both sides of the argument one of the primary functions of a brain is to extract biologically relevant information from sensory inputs the human brain is provided with information about light sound the chemical composition of the atmosphere temperature head orientation limb position the chemical composition of the bloodstream and more in other animals additional senses may be present such as the infrared heatsense of snakes the magnetic field sense of some birds or the electric field sense of some types of fish moreover other animals may develop existing sensory systems in new ways such as the adaptation by bats of the auditory sense into a form of sonar one way or another all of these sensory modalities are initially detected by specialized sensors that project signals into the brain  each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells such as lightreceptive neurons in the retina of the eye vibrationsensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear or pressuresensitive neurons in the skin the axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain where they transmit their signals to a firstorder sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality this primary sensory nucleus sends information to higherorder sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality eventually via a waystation in the thalamus the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex where they are processed to extract biologically relevant features and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems  motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements that is in activating muscles except for the muscles that control the eye which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain  spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord and by inputs that descend from the brain the intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming the descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control  the brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord at the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons which control stereotyped movements such as walking breathing or swallowing at a higher level are areas in the midbrain such as the red nucleus which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs at a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe the primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord through the pyramidal tract this direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements other motorrelated brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex basal ganglia and cerebellum  in addition to all of the above the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the autonomic nervous system which works by secreting hormones and by modulating the smooth muscles of the gut  the autonomic nervous system affects heart rate digestion respiration rate salivation perspiration urination and sexual arousal and several other processes most of its functions are not under direct voluntary control perhaps the most obvious aspect of the behavior of any animal is the daily cycle between sleeping and waking arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale though by an extensive network of brain areas  a key component of the arousal system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves from the two eyes cross the scn contains the bodys central biological clock neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours circadian rhythms these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of clock genes the scn continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves through the retinohypothalamic tract rht that allows daily lightdark cycles to calibrate the clock  the scn projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus brainstem and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleepwake cycles an important component of the system is the reticular formation a group of neuronclusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus which in turn sends activitylevelcontrolling signals to every part of the cortex damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma  sleep involves great changes in brain activity  until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep  but this is now known to be far from true activity continues but patterns become very different there are two types of sleep rem sleep with dreaming and nrem nonrem usually without dreaming sleep which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured rem light nrem and deep nrem during deep nrem sleep also called slow wave sleep activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep and fall almost to zero during rem sleep levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern  for any animal survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation these include temperature water content salt concentration in the bloodstream blood glucose levels blood oxygen level and others  the ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its bodythe milieu intérieur as pioneering physiologist claude bernard called itis known as homeostasis greek for standing still  maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain the basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback any time a parameter diverges from its setpoint sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value  this principle is widely used in engineering for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat in vertebrates the part of the brain that plays the greatest role is the hypothalamus a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function  the hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei most of which are involved in basic biological functions some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality aggression or maternal behaviors but many of them relate to homeostasis several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels conveying information about temperature sodium level glucose level blood oxygen level and other parameters these hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus the pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity  according to evolutionary theory individuals are genetically programmed to behave in ways that ensure survival and reproductive success this overarching goal of genetic fitness translates into a set of specific survivalpromoting behaviors such as seeking food water shelter and a mate  the motivational system in the brain monitors the current state of satisfaction of these goals and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise the motivational system works largely by a rewardpunishment mechanism when a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences the reward mechanism in the brain is activated which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later whenever a similar situation arises conversely when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences the brains punishment mechanism is activated inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future  most organisms studied to date utilize a rewardpunishment mechanism for instance worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers  in vertebrates the rewardpunishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain  there is substantial evidence that the basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain when this inhibition is released a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decisionsignals that are emitted the reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role addictive drugs such as cocaine amphetamine and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced  almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experienceeven the most primitive types of worms because behavior is driven by brain activity changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain theorists dating back to santiago ramón y cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons  until 1970 however experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking in 1971 tim bliss and terje lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called longterm potentiation the paper showed clear evidence of activityinduced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days  since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change and uncovered other types of activitydriven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas including the cerebral cortex hippocampus basal ganglia and cerebellum  brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process  neuroscientists currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by the brain in distinct ways the field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system  psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system the brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry the branch of medicine that works to study prevent and treat mental disorders  cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain such as computer science artificial intelligence and similar fields and philosophy  the oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical and until the middle of the 20th century much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes neuroanatomists study the largescale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components especially synapses among other tools they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure chemistry and connectivity in recent years the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes also functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior  neurophysiologists study the chemical pharmacological and electrical properties of the brain their primary tools are drugs and recording devices thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system some in highly specific ways recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes either glued to the scalp as in eeg studies or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons  because the brain does not contain pain receptors it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress the same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures  functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive  another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas even though it is protected by the skull and meninges surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from the bloodstream by the bloodbrain barrier the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage in humans the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage however this information is often difficult to interpret in animal studies most commonly involving rats it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior  computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches first the use of computers to study the brain second the study of how brains perform computation on one hand it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity such simulations are known as biologically realistic neural networks on the other hand it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating or mathematically analyzing the operations of simplified units that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity the computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists  recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brain   and a focus on the roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in neuroplasticity  the most common subjects are mice because of the availability of technical tools it is now possible with relative ease to knock out or mutate a wide variety of genes and then examine the effects on brain function more sophisticated approaches are also being used for example using crelox recombination it is possible to activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of the brain at specific times  the oldest brain to have been discovered was in armenia in the areni1 cave complex the brain estimated to be over 5000 years old was found in the skull of a 12 to 14yearold girl although the brains were shriveled they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave  early philosophers were divided as to whether the seat of the soul lies in the brain or heart aristotle favored the heart and thought that the function of the brain was merely to cool the blood democritus the inventor of the atomic theory of matter argued for a threepart soul with intellect in the head emotion in the heart and lust near the liver  hippocrates the father of medicine came down unequivocally in favor of the brain in his treatise on epilepsy he wrote men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys delights laughter and sports and sorrows griefs despondency and lamentations  and by the same organ we become mad and delirious and fears and terrors assail us some by night and some by day and dreams and untimely wanderings and cares that are not suitable and ignorance of present circumstances desuetude and unskillfulness all these things we endure from the brain when it is not healthy the roman physician galen also argued for the importance of the brain and theorized in some depth about how it might work galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain nerves and muscles demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves he postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon usually translated as animal spirits  galens ideas were widely known during the middle ages but not much further progress came until the renaissance when detailed anatomical study resumed combined with the theoretical speculations of rené descartes and those who followed him descartes like galen thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms he believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a nonphysical res cogitans but that the majority of behaviors of humans and all behaviors of animals could be explained mechanistically  the first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function though came from the investigations of luigi galvani who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract since that time each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation until the early years of the 20th century the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells  particularly critical was the invention of the golgi stain which when correctly used stains only a small fraction of neurons but stains them in their entirety including cell body dendrites and axon without such a stain brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers in which it is impossible to determine any structure in the hands of camillo golgi and especially of the spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramón y cajal the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity  in the first half of the 20th century advances in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells culminating in work by alan hodgkin andrew huxley and others on the biophysics of the action potential and the work of bernard katz and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse  these studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of the brain as a dynamic entity reflecting the new understanding in 1942 charles sherrington visualized the workings of the brain waking from sleep the great topmost sheet of the mass that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither the brain is waking and with it the mind is returning it is as if the milky way entered upon some cosmic dance swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one a shifting harmony of subpatterns in the second half of the 20th century developments in chemistry electron microscopy genetics computer science functional brain imaging and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure and function in the united states the 1990s were officially designated as the decade of the brain to commemorate advances made in brain research and to promote funding for such research  in the 21st century these trends have continued and several new approaches have come into prominence including multielectrode recording which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the same time  genetic engineering which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally  genomics which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in dna properties  and neuroimaging

V the duvernoys gland is a gland found in some groups of colubrid snakes it is distinguished from the venom gland and is not found in viperids or elapids it was named for french zoologist georges louis duvernoy who first described the gland in 1832  the duvernoys gland is positioned posterior to the eye encased in a thin cover of connective tissue and consists mostly of serous cells a single short duct extends anteromedially from the lumen of the gland to the base of the posterior fangs the function of the duvernoys gland has been the source of much study and speculation and debate is still ongoing it is widely recognized that the duvernoys gland is the homologue of venom glands in vipers and elapids   however the two types of glands are also anatomically and functionally distinct leading experts such as dr kenneth kardong to maintain the distinction between the duvernoys gland and venom glands   other scientists such as dr bryan fry maintain that the duvernoy gland is a primitive version of a venom gland and should be referred to as such  because the secretions of this gland are associated with the swallowing behavior of snakes the duvernoys gland may play a role in swallowing andor digestion  kardong also notes that although some duvernoys gland secretions may be toxic and that they can produce pain swelling and other effects if injected subcutaneously this does not make those secretions venoms

V the bartholins glands also called bartholin glands or greater vestibular glands are two pea sized compound racemose glands  located slightly posterior and to the left and right of the opening of the vagina they secrete mucus to lubricate the vagina and are homologous to bulbourethral glands in males however while bartholins glands are located in the superficial perineal pouch in females bulbourethral glands are located in the deep perineal pouch in males their duct length is 15 to 20 cm and open into navicular fossa  the ducts are paired and they open on the surface of the vulva   bartholins glands secrete mucus to provide vaginal lubrication   bartholins glands secrete relatively minute amounts of fluid when a woman is sexually aroused  the minute droplets of fluid were once believed to be important for lubricating the vagina but research from masters and johnson demonstrated that vaginal lubrication comes from deeper within the vagina  the fluid may slightly moisten the labial opening of the vagina serving to make contact with this sensitive area more comfortable for the woman  it is possible for the bartholins glands to become blocked and inflamed resulting in pain  this is known as bartholinitis or a bartholins cyst  a bartholins cyst in turn can become infected and form an abscess adenocarcinoma of the gland is rare but benign tumors and hyperplasia are even more rare  bartholins glands were first described in the 17th century by the danish anatomist caspar bartholin the younger 16551738  some sources mistakenly ascribe their discovery to his grandfather theologian and anatomist caspar bartholin the elder 15851629

V the planum temporale is the cortical area just posterior to the auditory cortex heschls gyrus within the sylvian fissure  it is a triangular region which forms the heart of wernickes area one of the most important functional areas for language  original studies on this area found that the planum temporale was one of the most asymmetric regions in the brain with this area being up to ten times larger in the left cerebral hemisphere than the right    the planum temporale makes up the superior surface of the superior temporal gyrus to the parietal lobe  the posterior extent of the planum temporale has been variably defined which has led to disputes to estimates of size and degree of asymmetry  the planum temporale shows a significant asymmetry in 65 of all individuals the left planum temporale appears to be more developed while the right planum temporale is more developed in only 11 in some peoples brains the planum temporale is more than five times larger on the left than on the right making it the most asymmetrical structure in the brain evidence for this asymmetry has also been seen in great apes  this greater size of the left planum temporale compared with the right is already present in the fetus where it can be observed starting from the 31st week of gestation this observation strengthens the hypothesis of a genetic predisposition for brain asymmetry however the effect of fetal experience has not been ruled out   leftward asymmetry however does not directly relate to asymmetry of language processing in all individuals  in addition more and more research is suggesting that the apparent asymmetries in this region are the result of old techniques and criteria used to identify the planum temporale when new imaging is used that takes into account asymmetries in the curvatures of lateral fissures the hemispheric asymmetries of the planum temporale become negligible this newer imaging would indicate that the size of the region would not explain the higher faculties of language in the left hemisphere but would instead require an analysis of the neural circuitry  the planum temporale is a highly lateralized brain structure involved with language and with music although the planum temporale is found to have an asymmetry in the normal population having a leftward bias in righthanded individuals people who possess absolute pitch have an increased leftward asymmetry of the planum temporale this is due to a smaller than average volume of the right planum temporale and not a larger than average volume of the left  the planum temporale may also play an important role in auditory processing with recent research suggesting that the region is responsible for representing the location of sounds in space  the planum temporale seems to be symmetrical in individuals with dyslexia which may indicate that their low specialization in the left hemisphere is a cause of their disability this symmetry also holds for people who stutter although it is also possible to see a larger right planum temporale in stutters it is thought that this bias for right hemisphere could be interrupting or impeding information flow between wernickes and brocas which are on the left hemisphere mri studies have shown that the planum temporale in schizophrenics is more symmetrical  this reduced lateralization correlates with more severe positive symptoms such as hallucinations as measured by the panss  although the brain area was thought to be unique to humans almost like the anatomic version of the linguistic language organ of noam chomsky it was shown to be similarly leftward asymmetric in chimpanzees and other great apes but not other primates  as was a related rightward asymmetric brain region the planum parietale that is implicated with dyslexia in humans  monkeys show cellular asymmetry but not gross anatomic asymmetry of the planum temporale  brain research 2008 the question still remains open what are great apes or monkeys using this nonhuman primate language area for

V the selfish brain theory describes the characteristic of the human brain to cover its own comparably high energy requirements with the utmost of priorities when regulating energy fluxes in the organism the brain behaves selfishly in this respect the selfish brain theory amongst other things provides a possible explanation for the origin of obesity the severe and pathological form of overweight the luebeck obesity and diabetes specialist achim peters developed the fundamentals of this theory between 1998 and 2004 the interdisciplinary selfish brain brain glucose and metabolic syndrome research group headed by peters and supported by the german research foundation dfg at the university of luebeck has in the meantime been able to reinforce the basics of the theory through experimental research   the brain performs many functions for the human organism most are of a cognitive nature or concern the regulation of the motor system a previously lesser investigated aspect of brain activity was the regulation of energy metabolism the selfish brain theory shed new light on this function this theory states that the brain behaves selfishly by controlling energy fluxes in such a way that it allocates energy to itself before the needs of the other organs are satisfied the internal energy consumption of the brain is very high although its mass constitutes only 2 of the entire body weight  it consumes 20 of the carbohydrates ingested over a 24hour period  this corresponds to 100 g of glucose per day or half the daily requirement for a human being a 30yearold office worker with a body weight of 75kg and a height of 185 m consumes approx 200 g glucose per day before now the scientific community assumed that the energy needs of the brain the muscles and the organs were all met in parallel the hypothalamus an area of the upper brainstem was thought to play a central role in regulating two feedback loops within narrow limits on the basis of these theories a number of international research groups still position the origin of obesity in a disorder in one of the two above described feedback systems however there are scenarios in weight regulation that can not be explained in this way for example upon inanition of the body eg during fasting almost all the organs such as the heart liver spleen and kidneys dramatically lose weight approx 40 and the blood glucose concentration falls during this time however the brain mass hardly changes less than 2 on average   a further example illustrates the inherent conflict between these two explanatory approaches although large amounts of the appetite suppressing hormone leptin are released in obese individuals they are still afflicted with a ravenous hunger once their blood glucose falls the selfish brain theory links in seamlessly with the traditions of the lipo and glucostatic theories what is new is that the selfish brain theory assumes there is another feedback control system that is supraordinate to the blood glucose and fat feedback control systems a feedback system is meant here in which the cerebral hemispheres the integrating organ for the entire central nervous system     control the atp concentration adenosinetriposphate  a form of energy currency for the organism of the neurons see 3 in this way the cerebral hemispheres ensure the primacy of the brains energy supply and are therefore considered in the selfish brain theory as wings of a central authority that governs energy metabolism whenever required the cerebral hemispheres direct an energy flux from the body to the brain to maintain its energy status in contrast to the ideas of jean mayer the selfish brain theory assumes an active energy on demand process it is controlled by cerebral atp sensors that react sensitively to changes in atp in neurons over the entire brain the selfish brain theory combines the theories of kennedy and mayer considering blood glucose and fat feedback control systems as a complex this regulates the energy flux from the environment to the body ie the intake of nutrients it is regulated by a hypothalamic nucleus here as well there are sensors that record changes in both blood glucose   and fat depots and which activate biochemical processes that maintain a certain body weight   for achieving their goal of maintaining energy homeostasis in the brain the cerebral hemispheres depend on subordinate feedback loops since these loops send signals for energy procurement to their control organ if these signals are not processed correctly eg due to impairments in the amygdala or hippocampus the energy supply to the brain will not be endangered but anomalies such as obesity can still result the origin of this is not to be found in the blood glucose or fat feedback control systems but much rather in the regulating instances within the cerebral hemispheres the brain can cover its energy needs particularly those of the cerebral hemispheres either by allocation or nutrient intake the corresponding signal to the subordinate regulatory system originates in the cerebral hemispheres the most phylogenetically recent part of the brain is characterized by a high plasticity and a high capacity to learn with this process it is always able to adapt its regulatory processes by processing responses from the periphery memorizing the results of individual feedback loops and behaviors and anticipating any possible buildups energy procurement by the brain is complicated by three factors firstly the brain always requests energy whenever it is needed it can only store energy in a very restricted form peters therefore refers to this as an energy on demand system secondly the brain is almost exclusively dependent on glucose as an atpsubstrate lactate and betahydroxybutyric acid can also be considered as substrates but only under certain conditions eg with considerable stress levels or malnutrition thirdly the brain is separated from the rest of the bodys circulation by the bloodbrainbarrier the blood glucose has to be brought there via a special insulinindependent transporter allocation represents the way a healthy brain secures its energy supply when acutely needed it diverts blood glucose from the periphery and leads it across the bloodbrainbarrier an important role here is played by the stress system whose neural pathways lead directly to the organs heart muscle adipose tissue liver pancreas etc and which also acts indirectly on these organs via the bloodstream by the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol this system ensures that the glucose is transported to the brain and that uptake by the musculature and the adipose tissue is reduced in order to achieve that the release of insulin and its effect on organs is halted the acute supply of energy to the brain from the intake of nutrients presents problems for the organism in the event of an emergency food intake is only activated if allocation is insufficient and must be taken as a sign of disease in this case the required energy can not be requested from the body and it can only be taken directly from the environment this pathology is due to defects lying within the control centers of the brain such as the hippocampus amygdala and hypothalamus these may be due to mechanical tumors injuries genetic defects lacking brainderived neurotrophic factor bdnf receptors or leptin receptors faulty programming posttraumatic stress disorder conditioning of eating behavior advertising for sweets or false signals may arise due to the influence of antidepressants drugs alcohol pesticides saccharin or viruses such disorders can have a negative impact on a number of behavioral types diseases can then result the selfish brain research group has concentrated above all on obesity as a pathology the following applies irrespective of the nature of energy provision the brain never gives up on being selfish peters therefore differentiates the healthy from the diseased brain through its ability to compete for its energy requirements even under adverse conditions where there are excessive demands from the body he contraposes the selfish brain with high fitness that can tap the bodies energy reserves even in times of short food supply at the expense of the body mass and the selfish brain with low fitness that is unable to do this and which instead takes in additional food and bears the risk of developing obesity the selfish brain theory can be considered as a new way to understand obesity     disorders in the control centers of the brain such as the hippocampus amygdala and hypothalamus are thought to underlie this as outlined above whatever the type of disruption that exists it entails that the energy procurement for the brain is accomplished less by allocation and more by the intake of nutrients even though the muscles have no additional energy requirement if one imagines the energy supply of the human organism as a supplychain that passes from the outside world with its numerous options for nutrient intake via the body to the brain as the end user and control organ then obesity can be considered as being caused by a buildup in this supplychain this is characterized by an excessive accumulation of energy in the adipose tissue or blood an allocation failure is expressed as a weakening of the sympathetic nervous system sns the result is that energy intended for the brain mainly enters buffer storage areas ie the adipose tissue and the musculature only a small proportion reaches the brain in order to cover its huge energy needs the brain commands the individual to consume more food the accumulation process escalates and the buffer storage areas are continuously filled up this leads to the development of obesity in many cases at a time which is dependent on an affected individuals personal disposition obesity can also be overlain by a diabetes mellitus in such a situation the adipose tissue and musculature can no longer accept any energy and the energy then accumulates in the blood so that hyperglycemia results in 1998 achim peters drafted the basic version of the selfish brain theory and formulated its axioms in his explanation of the selfish brain theory he referred to approx 5000 published citations from classical endocrinology and diabetology and the modern neurosciences but argued both mathematically using differential equations and system theoretically that was a novel methodological approach for diabetology the regulation of adenosine tripophoshate content plays a central role a type of energy currency for the organism in the brain peters assumes a double feedback structure where the atp content in the neurons of the brain is stabilized by measurements from two sensors of differing sensitivity that produce the raw energy request signals the more sensitive sensor records atp deficits and induces an allocation signal for glucose that is compensated for by requests from the body the other less sensitive sensor is only activated with glucose excesses and conveys a signal to halt the brain glucose allocation the optimal atp quantity is determined by the balance between these receptor signals peters considers that the stress system also operates according to this double feedback structure which is also closely related to the supply of glucose to the brain if an individual is confronted with a stressinducing stimulus it responds with an increased centralnervous information processing and along with that an increased glucose requirement in the brain the hormone cortisol important for regulating stress reactions and the hormone adrenaline important for glucose procurement are released from the adrenal glands the amount of cortisol that is released is also determined by a balance between a sensitive and a less sensitive sensor just as is the case with the control of atp content this process is terminated if the stress system returns to a resting state this model underlies the axioms for the selfish brain theory as developed by peters the selfish brain theory is an integrated concept since from a methodological standpoint it can be seen as a union of two separate research directions on the one hand it integrates peripheral metabolism research which investigates how energy metabolism functions through intake of nutrients into the organs of the body on the other it incorporates the results of the brain metabolism expert luc pellerin from the university of lausanne who found that the neurons in the brain are supplied with energy via their neighboring astrocytes whenever required this requirement oriented principle for the nerve cells is termed energy on demand with this approach the selfish brain theory recognizes the description of two ends of a supply chain the brain doesnt just control the supply chain but it is also its end consumer and not the body through which the supply chain passes the priority of the brain implies that the regulation of energy supply in a human organism is accomplished by the demand rather than the supply principle energy is ordered when it is needed after the axioms were formulated in 1998 achim peters sought experts in other specialties to develop his selfish brain theory further already at an early stage he had matched up his ideas with the views of other leading international scientists amongst them was the swiss brain metabolism specialist luc pellerin the renowned obesity expert denis g baskin the internationally famous stress researcher mary dallman and the renowned neurobiologist larry w swanson at the university of luebeck achim peters compared his findings with the wellknown neuroendocrinologist prof dr horst lorenz fehm a year later in 1999 an intensive collaboration was started with the psychiatrist and psychotherapist prof dr ulrich schweiger who also worked at the university of luebeck in 2004 the interdisciplinary research group selfish brain brain glucose and metabolic syndrome supported by the german research foundation dfg was officially founded achim peters was appointed to a professorship that was especially created for the group he also succeeded in winning over additional reputable scientists for the project including prof dr rolf hilgenfeld an eminent sars expert and the developer of one of the first inhibitors of the virus at this time the research group consists of 18 scientific subproject investigators from a number of specialties including internal medicine psychiatry neurobiology molecular medicine and mathematics the advisory committee includes professors luc pellerin denis baskin and mary dallman under its ranks according to the selfish brain theory obesity can also be attributed to psychological causes poor coping strategies in stress situations represent one of these an association was found between the tendency to evade conflict and the habit of reducing psychological stress by immediately consuming sweets the direct supply of glucose circumvents the glucose procurement from the body that would otherwise occur with a normal allocation process following the release of the stress hormone adrenaline an existing allocation problem with obesity can be made even worse by such bad behavior the stress system can also be weakened further because it may forget how to react autonomously these relationships have led to the development of an innovative multidisciplinary psychiatric and internal medical program at the university of luebeck for obesity therapy prof dr ulrich schweiger of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy led by prof dr f hohagen has been a key player in this development in close cooperation with schweiger the internist achim peters derived a therapeutic concept from the selfish brain theory that was fixed on both feelings and coordinated behavior emanating from the brain the aim of this therapy is to modify the settings and behaviors coded in the emotional memory centers of the brain that have become habit train the brain is the catchphrase describing these therapeutic measures that may be enabled by the unusual plasticity and learningcapacity of the brain it might just simply involve the practicing of eating behaviors that can be tolerated from a health perspective and combining this with a reduction in detrimental habits however it could also involve the modification of behaviors associated with the handling of conflicts and other stress situations according to the view of the selfish brain research group if defective allocation is compensated for chronically by immediately consuming foodstuffs a risk arises that eating will become the only reaction to a situation that requires a considerably more complex social behavior the therapy of obesity therefore has both a physiological and a psychological component it is not just the ability to allocate that must be restored but actions and behaviors in everyday life in the first dfg funding period from 2004 to 2007 researchers from the clinical research group selfish brain brain glucose and metabolic syndrome expanded the scope of validity of the selfish brain theory in central aspects by carrying out experiments on healthy and diseased test subjects the researchers in luebeck found the following key results regarding the axioms of the theory         the special position of the brain during inanition due to fasting or tumor disease was already confirmed experimentally over 80 years ago the body mass reduces but the mass of the brain hardly reduces if at all see 3 recently this axiom of the selfish brain theory was supported by work at the university of luebeck involving stateoftheart magnetic resonance procedures eg during metabolic stress the atp content in the brain and musculature of test subjects was examined by a magnetic resonance technique while either an energy deficit or surplus was induced in the blood by insulin or glucose injection in both situations a sufficiently high atpconcentration was measured in the brain the measured highenergyrich substances changed throughout to the benefit of the brain and to the disadvantage of the body cells the glucosesupply of the brain had priority despite the physical stress that was being endured see 11 some of the results were presented at the international congress organized by the selfish brain research group at the 23 and 24 february 2006 in luebeck as well as at a press conference aimed at both specialists and the wider public in the second funding period that has been running since the end of 2007 the clarification of the following questions has now become the focus of interest

V pronephros the most basic of the three excretory organs that develop in vertebrates corresponding to the first stage of kidney development it is succeeded by the mesonephros which in fish and amphibians remains as the adult kidney in amniotes the mesonephros is the embryonic kidney and a more complex metanephros acts as the adult kidney once a more advanced kidney forms the previous version typically degenerates by apoptosis or becomes part of the male reproductive system the pronephros develops from the intermediate mesoderm as do the later kidneys it is a paired organ consisting of a single giant nephron that processes blood filtrate produced from glomeruli or glomera large embryonic glomeruli the filtrate is deposited into the coelom it then passes through thin ciliated tubules into the pronephric nephron where it is processed for solute recovery the organ is active in adult forms of some primitive fish like lampreys or hagfish it is present at the embryo of more advanced fish and at the larval stage of amphibians where it plays an essential role in osmoregulation in human beings it is rudimentary appears at the end of the third week day 20 and replaced by mesonephros after 35 weeks despite this transient appearance in mammals the pronephros is essential for the development of the adult kidneys the duct of the mesonephros forms the wolffian duct and ureter of the adult kidney the embryonic kidney and its derivatives also produces the inductive signals that trigger formation of the adult kidney   the pronephros is the first in a sequence of kidneys that form in vertebrate embryos the pronephric primordium develops from the intermediate mesoderm lying between the paraxial somitic mesoderm and the lateral plate in many organisms eg amphibians this primodium forms anteriorly then migrates posteriorly to fuse with the cloaca while in others it forms along the length of the intermediate mesoderm eg aritra ghosh in both amphibians and zebrafish the pronephros has a single nephron attached to a nephric duct which in turn is linked to the cloaca although these kidneys have a simple anatomical organization with only a single nephron the nephrons have a segmental and functional complexity that is very similar to that in more complex kidneys such as mesonephroi and metanephroi one unique feature of pronephroi is the arrangement by which the glomerular filtrate is generated and collected by the nephron in pronephroi the glomerulus or glomus if it extends over multiple body segments projects into the coelom rather than into the proximal tip of the nephron the glomerular filtrate flows directly into the coelom or a dorsal compartment of the coelom known as the nephrocoel in jawless fishes the pronephric glomus projects into the pericardial cavity fluids are swept from the filtration cavity into the nephron through cilated funnels known as nephrostomes these thin epithelial tubes are densely packed with cilia and have a distinct morpology to the other tubular epithelia of the kidney older anatomical texts describe the pronephros as condensing from nephrotomes but modern visualization techniques have shown that this represents a histological artifact once the more complex mesonephros forms the pronephros undergoes apoptosis in amphibians in fishes the nephron degenerates but the organ remains and becomes a component of the immune system in mammals a functional pronephros in the context of an organ performing waste excretion or osmoregulation does not develop however a kidney primordium that runs along the intermediate mesoderm does form and links up to the cloaca this duct is known as the pronephric duct mesonephric duct or wolffian duct while this transient primordium never forms functional nephrons the duct derived from it is essential to the development of the more complex later kidneys

V the principles that govern the evolution of brain structure are not well understood brain to body size does not scale isometrically in a linear fashion but rather allometrically the brains and bodies of mammals do not scale linearly small bodied mammals have relatively large brains compared to their bodies and large mammals such as whales have small brains similar to growth if brain weight is plotted against body weight for primates the regression line of the sample points can indicate the brain power of a primate species lemurs for example fall below this line which means that for a primate of equivalent size we would expect a larger brain size humans lie well above the line indicating that humans are more encephalized than lemurs in fact humans are more encephalized than all other primates encephalization quotients eqs may indicate how much brain power a species has in comparison to other mammals primates lie at the top of this range with humans having the highest eq score eq has a high degree of correlation with the ecological conditions of an animal such as its feeding behaviours and food it consumes  leaf eating monkeys have lower eq than frugivorous or omnivorous monkeys since they have to work harder to forage than monkeys which eat abundant easy to find leaves    the evolutionary history of the human brain shows primarily a gradually bigger brain relative to body size during the evolutionary path from early primates to hominids and finally to homo sapiens human brain size has been trending upwards since 2 million years ago with a 3 factor increase early australopithecine brains were little larger than chimpanzee brains the increase has been seen as larger human brain volume as we progressed along the human timeline of evolution see homininae starting from about 600cm  in homo habilis up to 1500cm  in homo sapiens neanderthalensis which is the hominid with the biggest brain size the increase in brain size topped with neanderthals since then the average brain size has been shrinking over the past 28000 years the male brain has decreased from 1500cm  to 1350cm  while the female brain has shrunk by the same relative proportion  however it is argued that another essential element of brain evolution in humans is rearrangement hoffman et al 2004  larger brains require more wiring but more wiring can become inefficient hofman 2001 the brain has therefore become reorganized for efficiency furthermore the average body size of nethanderthals was larger which lead to bigger brain size see braintobody mass ratio from fossil records scientists can infer that the first brain structure appeared in worms over 500 million years ago the functions of the hindbrain found in the fossil records included breathing heart beat regulation balance basic motor movements and foraging skills a trend in brain evolution according to a study done with mice chickens monkeys and apes concluded that more evolved species tend to preserve the structures responsible for basic behaviors what this means is that evolution is the process of acquiring more and more sophisticated structures not simply the addition of different structures over a long period of time  a long term study comparing the human brain to the primitive brain found that the modern human brain contains the primitive hindbrain region  what most neuroscientists call the protoreptilian brain  the purpose of this part of the brain is to sustain fundamental homeostatic functions the pons and medulla are major structures found there a new region of the brain developed about 250 million years after the appearance of the hindbrain this region is known as the paleomammalian brain the major parts of which are the hippocampi and amygdalas often referred to as the limbic system the limbic system deals with more complex functions including emotional sexual and fighting behaviors  the brainstem and limbic system are largely based on nuclei which are essentially balledup clusters of tightlypacked neurons and the axon fibers that connect them to each other as well as to neurons in other locations the other two major brain areas the cerebrum and cerebellum are based on a cortical architecture at the outer periphery of the cortex the neurons are arranged into layers the number of which vary according to species and function a few millimeters thick there are axons that travel between the layers but the majority of axon mass is below the neurons themselves since cortical neurons and most of their axon fiber tracts dont have to compete for space cortical structures can scale more easily than nuclear ones a key feature of cortex is that because it scales with surface area more of it can be fit inside a skull by introducing convolutions in much the same way that a dinner napkin can be stuffed into a glass by wadding it up the degree of convolution is generally greater in more evolved species which benefit from the increased surface area the cerebellum or little brain is behind the brainstem and below the occipital lobe of the cerebrum in humans its purposes include the coordination of fine sensorimotor tasks and it may be involved in some cognitive functions such as language human cerebellar cortex is finely convoluted much more so than cerebral cortex its interior axon fiber tracts are called the arbor vitae or tree of life the area of the brain with the greatest amount of recent evolutionary change is called the cerebrum or neocortex in reptiles and fish this area is called the pallium and is smaller and simpler relative to body mass than what is found in mammals according to research the cerebrum first developed about 200 million years ago its responsible for higher cognitive functions  for example language thinking and related forms of information processing  its also responsible for processing sensory input together with the thalamus a part of the limbic system that acts as an information router most of its function is subconscious that is not available for inspection or intervention by the conscious mind neocortex is an elaboration or outgrowth of structures in the limbic system with which it is tightly integrated with the use of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging mri and tissue sampling different cortical samples from members of each hominoid species were analyzed in each species specific areas were either relatively enlarged or shrunken which can detail neural organizations different sizes in the corticol areas can show specific adaptations functional specializations and evolutionary events that were changes in how the hominoid brain is organized in early prediction it was thought that the frontal lobe a large part of the brain that is generally devoted to behavior and social interaction was the main player in the differences of behavior in hominoid and humans this theory was dispelled by the test that showed that with damage to the frontal lobe both humans and homonoids show atypical social and emotional behavior meaning that the frontal lobe was not very likely to be selected for reorganization instead it is now believed that other parts of the brain that are strictly associated with certain behaviors was where evolution targeted the reorganization that took place is thought to have been more organizational than volumetric whereas the brain volumes were relatively the same but specific landmark position of surface anatomical features for example the lunate sulcus suggest that the brains had been through a neurological reorganization  there is also evidence that the early hominin lineage also underwent a quiescent period which supports the idea of neural reorganization dental fossil records for early humans and hominins show that immature hominins including australopithecines and members of homo reveal that these species have a quiescent period bown et al 1987 a quiescent period is a period in which there are no dental eruptions of adult teeth at this time the child becomes more accustomed to social structure and development of culture during this time the child is given an extra advantage over other hominoids devoting several years into developing speech and learning to cooperate within a community  this period is also discussed in relation to encephalization it was discovered that chimpanzees do not have this neutral dental period and suggest that a quiescent period occurred in very early hominin evolution using the models for neurological reorganization it can be suggested the cause for this period dubbed middle childhood is most likely for enhanced foraging abilities in varying seasonal environments to understand the development of human dentition taking a look at behavior and biology  bruce lahn the senior author at the howard hughes medical center at the university of chicago and colleagues have suggested that there are specific genes that control the size of the human brain these genes continue to play a role in brain evolution implying that the brain is continuing to evolve the study began with the researchers assessing 214 genes that are involved in brain development these genes were obtained from humans macaques rats and mice lahn and the other researchers noted points in the dna sequences that caused protein alterations these dna changes were then scaled to the evolutionary time that it took for those changes to occur the data showed the genes in the human brain evolved much faster than those of the other species once this genomic evidence was acquired lahn and his team decided to find the specific gene or genes that allowed for or even controlled this rapid evolution two genes were found to control the size of the human brain as it develops these genes are microcephalin and abnormal spindlelike microcephaly aspm the researchers at the university of chicago were able to determine that under the pressures of selection both of these genes showed significant dna sequence changes lahns earlier studies displayed that microcephalin experienced rapid evolution along the primate lineage which eventually led to the emergence of homo sapiens after the emergence of humans microcephalin seems to have shown a slower evolution rate on the contrary aspm showed its most rapid evolution in the later years of human evolution once the divergence between chimpanzees and humans had already occurred  each of the gene sequences went through specific changes that lead to the evolution of humans from ancestral relatives in order to determine these alterations lahn and his colleagues used dna sequences from multiple primates then compared and contrasted the sequences with those of humans following this step the researchers statistically analyzed the key differences between the primate and human dna to come to the conclusion that the differences were due to natural selection the changes in dna sequences of these genes accumulated to bring about a competitive advantage and higher fitness that humans possess in relation to other primates this comparative advantage is coupled with a larger brain size which ultimately allows the human mind to have a higher cognitive awareness

V tobacco is a segment about the tobacco industry which aired as part of the second episode of the second season of the hbo series last week tonight with john oliver on february 15 2015 during the eighteenminute segment comedian john oliver discusses tobacco industry trends and practices he also introduces jeff the diseased lung a mascot he created for the american global cigarette and tobacco company philip morris international the makers of marlboro cigarettes the anthropomorphic diseased lung who smokes and coughs has been compared to joe camel and the marlboro man oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with jeffs image to togo and displaying billboards in uruguay and by encouraging use of the hashtag jeffwecan which trended on twitter following the broadcast philip morris issued a response to the segment which received some criticism the tobacco segment received widespread media coverage with some outlets praising olivers ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot jeff later appeared at a protest organized by the campaign for tobaccofree kids in new york city in may 2015   tobacco is an eighteenminute segment about the tobacco industry delivered by john oliver during the february 15 2015 episode of last week tonight with john oliver in the segment oliver describes industry trends and practices such as the decline of smoking in the united states and marketing tactics by tobacco companies to introduce cigarettes to young people in emerging markets   he incorporates clips featuring the marlboro man a figure used in advertising campaigns for marlboro cigarettes and notes that four of the actors who portrayed the character died from lung cancer and smokingrelated illnesses   furthermore oliver outlines the legal actions taken by tobacco companies against governments of australia namibia the solomon islands togo and uruguay  some of which have displayed grotesque images of blackened teeth and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on cigarette packaging to illustrate the harmful effects of smoking  he asserts that companies are able to avoid stricter regulations by threatening to sue entire countries many of which do not have resources to combat these lawsuits in court    by the morning of february 16 the segment had been viewed more than two million times  during the segment oliver offers the mascot jeff the diseased lung fully named jeff the diseased lung in a cowboy hat to philip morris international to use free of charge    jeff a fictional anthropomorphic cartoon character who smokes and coughs  has been called olivers version of joe camel and compared to the marlboro man   jeff has been described as a cartoonlike diseased lung cowboy created by crossing the diseased lung pictured on cigarette packs in australia with the marlboro man  similarly rolling stones daniel kreps said jeff helps to bridge the gap between the marlboro man  and a lung that looks like youre breathing through baked ziti  alicia lu of bustle wrote sure he may be an anthropomorphic lung thats decaying from being exposed to years of cigarette smoke which might not be big tobaccos first choice for branding but hes a cowboy look at his regal cowboy hat his spiffy red cowboy boots and the way that cigarette nonchalantly dangles from his lips  doesnt jeff remind you of a figure from days of yore if you squint i swear youll see the marlboro man  oliver and his team promoted the character by sending shirts with his image to togo and displaying billboards in uruguay   during the segment oliver encouraged viewers to use the hashtag jeffwecan which trended on twitter    he also called on viewers to upload images of the mascot to google accounts so jeff would be displayed following google images searches for marlboro   a live version of jeff appears at the end of the tobacco segment sarene leeds of the wall street journal called jeffs appearance a fullon disneylandish nightmare and wrote there is nothing more disturbing  or awesome  that you will see today than the sight of john oliver dancing around a guy dressed up as a smoking infected lung surrounded by more than a dozen children  the hbo shop sells tshirts depicting the mascot  jeff appeared at kick butts day a protest organized by the campaign for tobaccofree kids and youth advocates which was held outside philip morris annual shareholders meeting in new york city on may 6 2015  the protests featured a flash mob with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics we dont want your cigarettes jeff we can the performance ended with the mascot rolling around on the floor in a coughing fit and loss of breath shana narula the campaigns coordinator said the whole concept is to use jeff and the hashtag jeffwecan and stopmarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world and the fact is its the only consumer product that when used as intended it kills its user this is very very unique  no other consumer product does this most people think that tobacco is not really an issue in this country anymore and thats completely not true thats what we want to shed light on today in a fashion where people will take notice  philip morris issued a statement which read in part on february 15 2015 the last week tonight with john oliver show dedicated a significant portion of its program to our company  last week tonight with john oliver is a parody show known for getting a laugh through exaggeration and presenting partial views in the name of humor the segment includes many mischaracterizations of our company including our approach to marketing and regulation which have been embellished in the spirit of comedic license  while we recognize the tobacco industry is an easy target for comedians we take seriously the responsibility that comes with selling a product that is an adult choice and is harmful to health  we support and comply with thousands of regulations worldwide  including advertising restrictions penalties for selling tobacco products to minors and substantial health warnings on packaging were investing billions into developing and scientifically assessing a portfolio of products that have the potential to be less harmful and that are satisfying so smokers will switch to them and like any other company with a responsibility to its business partners shareholders and employees we ask only that laws protecting investments including trademarks be equally applied to us  the statement also provided to readers a balanced view and facts about the issues raised by oliver including the companys marketing practices and approach to regulation philip morris included links to its be marlboro campaign which is aimed at competing for existing adult smoker market share reasons for why the company is challenging australia and uruguays censorship of their trademarks and facts about smoking prevalence in australia after the introduction of plain packaging  chris morran of consumerist said philip morris did a really poor job of trying to defend its actions he wrote  this should be where the very serious folks at philip morris go point by point and explain where oliver exaggerated and embellished but they dont its a classic nonresponse in which the accused tried to undercut the accusers argument by claiming he cant possibly be providing the truth  he notes that philip morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company expects to be taken seriously when it readily admits that the products it sells are harmful to health  furthermore morran takes aim at the companys claim that it supports and complies with thousands of regulations worldwide writing  the tobacco industry doesnt support these regulations it only supports the ones it cant fight in a courtroom once it loses a battle  or realizes a battle cant be won  then suddenly big tobacco just like every other heavily regulated industry claims to support and abide by the rules  finally he said of the statements final sentence thats honestly the best philip morris and big tobacco can come up with  weve spent a lot of money and have a lot of investors so please dont mess with our packaging because it might cause us to earn smaller profits  its an argument that might be tenable if cigarettes did anything other than poison the people who buy them  or live in the same house with them  the tobacco segment received widespread media coverage with some outlets praising olivers ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and alter perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot jeff   her campus kelly tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by olivers fans during the segment and wrote while john oliver simply considers himself a comedian it is apparent that he is doing much more than comedy he informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldnt hear or think deeply about which in and of itself is brilliant but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues he shows us that there really is something we can do and helps us to see how we can enact change  mediapost communications marketing daily published an article called what marketers can learn from john oliver in which james g brooks jr complimented olivers ability to encourage audience participation he wrote jeff trended worldwide this kind of reaction is ideal for any marketing campaign  alex frail of the massachusetts daily collegian said one of his funnier bits jeff the diseased lung took aim at the tobacco industry landed on cigarette packs throughout australia and on billboards throughout uruguay and delivered tshirts to togo the power to spark a movement like jeff the diseased lung isnt shared by olivers contemporaries  jeffrey wasserman vice president and director of rand health opined john olivers jeff character is of course a mockery of an iconic figure the marlboro man whose legacy turned out to be cruelly ironic as oliver noted in his show four former marlboro men died of smokingrelated causes lets hope that jeff going viral causes current and prospective smokersmainly teens and preteensto recognize cigarette smoking for what it is the most deadly habit  in july 2015 slant magazines julia pressman describes the tobacco segment in her article the british dude who is winning americas war on bullshit in which she features five ways oliver has owned 2015 thus far  the website inverse included the february 15 segment the second most effective from the shows second season saying it may be the most lasting of the entire year furthermore the websites matthew strauss wrote jeff shows up when you google imagesearch marlboro hes on bus stops in uruguay and hes on tshirts in togo jeff is an icon oliver hasnt taken down big tobacco but he sure didnt make them look too good  in august the los angeles times named oliver and costume designer mikaela wohl winners in the costume designers quietest cry for help category for the papers 2015 envy awards a parody of the annual emmy awards randee dawn complimented both for their hard work and humor but said wohls work on amazing costumes like jeff and russian space sex gecko distracted her from using her creative energies for dressing oliver

V a nipple clamp is a clamp that can be applied to the nipples of any type of body it is a sex toy which can be attached to the nipples to create pain by restricting blood flow from erect nipples by applying pressure to them some people derive erotic pleasure from seeing nipple clamps applied they are used in some bdsm activities such as tit torture the use of nipple clamps is often portrayed in the media as deviant or kinky sexual behavior the main types of nipple clamp are the clover clamp tweezer clamp and clothespin style though any device that applies direct pressure can be used for selfuse successful application requires the user to find a personal balance between the amount of pain and pleasure by fine tuning the degree of pressure exerted by the clamp the clamps are typically used in pairs and connected by a chain weights may be hung from the clamps to increase the pressure on the nipples and to discourage the clamped person from moving suddenly for example jumping when spanked or caned since this would make the weights swing and increase the pain another variation involves another chain being attached to the chain connecting the nipple clamps the end of which is connected either to a clamp to be attached to the clitoris for female or a cock ring for male this variation is known as the y clamps for the shape of the chain linking all 3 connection points when attached to the body   a clothespin style clamp works like a common household clothespin  two short lengths of metal joined by a spring to keep one end closed this type often comes with screws to adjust the pressure screwing in to release it a tweezer clamp consists of two short lengths of metal no more than 510cm 24in in length the two lengths are fixed together at one end and open at the other end just like a regular tweezer the open ends are curved slightly to improve their ability to grip the nipple typically they have a small 1cm rubber sheath over this end to protect the nipple from damage and reduce slippage a small ring wraps around the two pieces of metal and is used to adjust the tension the user places the two sides of the metal head either side of the nipple then by sliding the ring along the clamp shaft towards the nipple causes the two halves to close tighter together tension can thus be adjusted depending on the location of the ring  the closer the ring is along the shaft toward the nipple the tighter the clamp the clover clamp also referred to as a butterfly clamp is of japanese design  and provides increasing tension if pulled the clamp itself is flat about 5cm by 10cm 2 by 4in in size the clamp is applied to the nipple and the spring tension holds the clamp in place the clamp usually provides a very high pain level and is usually only used by more advanced users to increase tension on the nipples small weights such as fishing line sinkers can be attached to the ends of the clamp as increased pulling tension is applied to the clamp it will cause the jaws of the clamp to close tighter depending on the amount of pull pressure another method is to use the clamps to keep a person in one place if cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move eventually the clamps would be pulled off the nipples but not before considerable pain is felt if left on for too long can cause nipple irritation notes

V an artificial organ is a manmade device that is implanted or integrated into a human to replace a natural organ for the purpose of restoring a specific function or a group of related functions so the patient may return to a normal life as soon as possible the replaced function doesnt necessarily have to be related to life support but often is implied by this definition is the fact that the device must not be continuously tethered to a stationary power supply or other stationary resources such as filters or chemical processing units periodic rapid recharging of batteries refilling of chemicals andor cleaningreplacing of filters would exclude a device from being called an artificial organ thus a dialysis machine while a very successful and critically important life support device that completely replaces the duties of a kidney is not an artificial organ at this time an efficient selfcontained artificial kidney has not become available   reasons to construct and install an artificial organ an extremely expensive process initially which may entail many years of ongoing maintenance services not needed by a natural organ might include the use of any artificial organ by humans is almost always preceded by extensive experiments with animals initial testing in humans is frequently limited to those either already facing death or who have exhausted every other treatment possibility rarely testing may be done on healthy volunteers who are scheduled for execution pertaining to violent crimes although not typically thought of as organs one might also consider replacement bone and joints thereof such as hip replacements in this context neurostimulators including deep brain stimulators send electrical impulses to the brain in order to relieve movement disorders including parkinsons disease as well as epilepsy depression and other conditions such as increased bladder secretions rather than replacing existing neural networks to restore function these devices often serve by disrupting the output of existing malfunctioning nerve centers to eliminate symptoms artificial cardia and pylorus can be used to fight esophageal cancer achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease this pertains to gastric repairs specifically of the valves at either end of the stomach  to treat erectile dysfunction both corpora cavernosa can be irreversibly surgically replaced with manually inflatable penile implants this is a drastic therapeutic surgery meant only for men who suffer from complete impotence that has resisted all other treatment approaches an implanted pump in the groin or scrotum can be manipulated by hand to fill these artificial cylinders normally sized to be direct replacements for the natural corpora cavernosa from an implanted reservoir in order to achieve an erection  while natural hearing to the level of musical quality is not typically achieved most recipients are pleased with some finding it useful enough to return to their surgeon with a request to do the other  the most successful functionreplacing artificial eye so far is actually an external miniature digital camera with a remote unidirectional electronic interface implanted on the retina optic nerve or other related locations inside the brain the present state of the art yields only very partial functionality such as recognizing levels of brightness swatches of color andor basic geometric shapes proving the concepts potential while the living eye is indeed a camera it is also much more than that various researchers have demonstrated that the retina performs strategic image preprocessing for the brain the problem of creating a 100 functional artificial electronic eye is even more complex than what is already obvious steadily increasing complexity of the artificial connection to the retina optic nerve or related brain areas advances combined with ongoing advances in computer science is expected to dramatically improve the performance of this technology for the person whose damaged or diseased living eye retains some function other options superior to the electronic eye may be available  while considered a success the use of artificial hearts is limited to patients awaiting transplants whose death is imminent the current state of the heart devices are unable to reliably sustain life beyond about 18 months artificial pacemakers are electronic devices which can either intermittently augment defibrillator mode continuously augment or completely bypass the natural living cardiac pacemaker as needed are so successful that they have become commonplace ventricular assist devices are mechanical circulatory devices that partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart without the removal of the heart itself artificial arms and legs or prosthetics are intended to restore a degree of normal function to amputees mechanical devices that allow amputees to walk again or continue to use two hands have probably been in use since ancient times the most notable one being the simple peg leg surgical procedure for amputation however was not largely successful until around 600 bc armorers of the middle ages created the first sophisticated prostheses using strong heavy inflexible iron to make limbs that the amputee could scarcely control even with the articulated joints invented by ambroise paré in the 1500s the amputee could not flex at will artificial hands of the time were quite beautiful and intricate imitations of real hands but were not exceptionally functional upper limbs developed by peter baliff of berlin in 1812 for belowelbow amputees and van peetersen in 1844 for aboveelbow amputees were functional but still far less than ideal the nineteenth century saw a lot of changes most initiated by amputees themselves j e hanger an engineering student lost his leg in the civil war he subsequently designed an artificial leg for himself and in 1861 founded a company to manufacture prosthetic legs the j e hanger company is still in existence today another amputee named a a winkley developed a slipsocket belowknee device for himself and with the help of lowell jepson founded the winkley company in 1888 they marketed the legs during the national civil war veterans reunion thereby establishing their company another amputee named d w dorrance invented a terminal device to be used in the place of a hand in 1909 dorrance who had lost his right arm in an accident was unhappy with the prosthetic arms then available until his invention they had consisted of a leather socket and a heavy steel frame and either had a heavy cosmetic hand in a glove a rudimentary mechanical hand or a passive hook incapable of prehension dorrance invented a split hook that was anchored to the opposite shoulder and could be opened with a strap across the back and closed by rubber bands his terminal device the hook is still considered to be a major advancement for amputees because it restored their prehension abilities to some extent modified hooks are still used today though they might be hidden by realisticlooking skin hepalife is developing a bioartificial liver device intended for the treatment of liver failure using stem cells the artificial liver currently under development is designed to serve as a supportive device either allowing the liver to regenerate upon acute liver failure or to bridge the patients liver functions until a transplant is available  it is only made possible by the fact that it uses real liver cells hepatocytes and even then it is not a permanent substitute for a liver on the other hand researchers colin mcgucklin professor of regenerative medicine at newcastle university and nico forraz senior research associate and clinical sciences business manager at newcastle university say that pieces of artificial liver could be used to repair livers injured in the next five years these artificial livers could also be used outside the body in a manner analogous to the dialysis process used to keep alive patients whose kidneys have failed  the researchers from japan found that a mixture of human liver precursor cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs and two other cell types can spontaneously form threedimensional structures dubbed liver buds in the mice these liver buds formed functional connections with natural blood vessels and perform some liverspecific functions such as breaking down drugs in the bloodstream  with some almost fully functional artificial lungs promise to be a great success in near future  an ann arbor company mc3 is currently working on this type of medical device for the treatment of diabetes numerous promising techniques are currently being developed including some that incorporate donated living tissue housed in special materials to prevent the patients immune system from killing the foreign live components the two main methods for replacing bladder function involve either redirecting urine flow or replacing the bladder in situ  standard methods for replacing the bladder involve fashioning a bladderlike pouch from intestinal tissue  an alternative emerging method involves growing a bladder from cells taken from the patient and allowed to grow on a bladdershaped scaffold  reproductive age patients who develop cancer often receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy which damages oocytes and leads to early menopause an artificial human ovary has been developed at brown university  with selfassembled microtissues created using novel 3d petri dish technology the artificial ovary will be used for the purpose of in vitro maturation of immature oocytes and the development of a system to study the effect of environmental toxins on folliculogenesis an implantable machine that performs the function of a thymus does not exist however researchers have been able to grow a thymus from reprogrammed fibroblasts they expressed hope that the approach could one day replace or supplement neonatal thymus transplantation  surgeons in sweden performed the first implantation of a synthetic trachea in july 2011 for a 36yearold patient who was suffering from cancer stem cells taken from the patients hip were treated with growth factors and incubated on a plastic replica of his natural trachea  it is also possible to construct and install an artificial organ to give its possessor abilities which are not naturally occurring research is proceeding particularly in areas of vision memory and information processing however this idea is still in its infancy some current research focuses on restoring inoperative shortterm memory in accident victims and lost access to longterm memory in dementia patients success here would lead to widespread interest in applications for persons whose memory is considered healthy to dramatically enhance their memory far beyond what can be achieved with mnemonic techniques given that our understanding of how living memory actually works is incomplete it is unlikely this scenario will become reality in the near future one area of success was achieved in 2002 when a british scientist kevin warwick had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the internet with this in place he carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the internet to control a robotic hand a form of extended sensory input and the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans  another idea with significant consequences is that of implanting a language translator for diplomatic and military applications while machine translation does exist it is presently neither good nor small enough to fulfill its promise this might also include the existing and controversial when applied to humans practice of implanting subcutaneous chips integrated circuits for identification and location purposes an example of this is the rfid tags made by verichip corporation npr reported scientists are developing palmsized mock human organs designed to test drugs and help understand the basic function of healthy or diseased organs researchers are hopeful this technology may speed up drug development and make it less expensive

V parietal cells also known as oxyntic or delomorphous cells are the epithelial cells that secrete hydrochloric acid hcl and intrinsic factor these cells are located in the gastric glands found in the lining of the fundus and in the body of the stomach they contain an extensive secretory network called canaliculi from which the hcl is secreted by active transport into the stomach the enzyme hydrogen potassium atpase h k  atpase is unique to the parietal cells and transports the h  against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1 which is the steepest ion gradient formed in the human body parietal cells are primarily regulated via histamine acetylcholine and gastrin signaling from both central and local modulators see regulation   hydrochloric acid is formed in the following manner as a result of the cellular export of hydrogen ions the gastric lumen is maintained as a highlyacidic environment the acidity aids in digestion of food by promoting the unfolding or denaturing of ingested proteins as proteins unfold the peptide bonds linking component amino acids are exposed gastric hcl simultaneously activates pepsinogen an endopeptidase that advances the digestive process by breaking the nowexposed peptide bonds a process known as proteolysis parietal cells secrete acid in response to three types of stimuli  activation of histamine through h2 receptor causes increases intracellular camp level while ach through m3 receptor and gastrin through cck2 receptor increases intracellular calcium level these receptors are present on basolateral side of membrane increased camp level results in increased protein kinase a protein kinase a phosphorylates proteins involved in the transport of h k  atpase from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane this causes resorption of k  ions and secretion of h  ions the ph of the secreted fluid can fall by 08 gastrin primarily induces acidsecretion indirectly increasing histamine synthesis in ecl cellswhich in turn signal parietal cells via histamine releaseh2 stimulation  gastrin itself has no effect on the maximum histaminestimulated gastric acid secretion  the effect of histamine acetylcholine and gastrin is synergistic that is effect of two simultaneously is more than additive of effect of the two individually it helps in nonlinear increase of secretion with stimuli physiologically  parietal cells also produce intrinsic factor intrinsic factor is required for the absorption of vitamin b12 in the diet a longterm deficiency in vitamin b12 can lead to megaloblastic anemia characterized by large fragile erythrocytes pernicious anaemia results from autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells precluding the synthesis of intrinsic factor and by extension absorption of vitamin b12 pernicious anemia also leads to megaloblastic anemia atrophic gastritis particularly in the elderly will cause an inability to absorb b12 and can lead to deficiencies such as decreased dna synthesis and nucleotide metabolism in the bone marrow a canaliculus is an adaptation found on gastric parietal cells it is a deep infolding or little channel which serves to increase the surface area eg for secretion the parietal cell membrane is dynamic the numbers of canaliculi rise and fall according to secretory need this is accomplished by the fusion of canalicular precursors or tubulovesicles with the membrane to increase surface area and the reciprocal endocytosis of the canaliculi reforming the tubulovesicles to decrease it

V the gutbrain axis refers to the biochemical signaling taking place between the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system often involving intestinal microbiota  which have been shown to play an important role in healthy brain function   the gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system through different pathways neural immune and endocrine and influences the brain more specifically its function and its behaviour several studies have shown that the gut microbiota is involved in the regulation of anxiety pain cognition and mood these studies used germ free animals compared to normal animals which were later exposed to pathogenic bacterial infections probiotic bacteria and antibiotic drugs the gutbrain axis is an emerging concept that could be helpful for developing new therapeutic strategies for complex central nervous system disorders by modifying the gut microbiota    research suggests that the gutbrain axis a bidirectional neurohumoral communication system in the human body functions as a pathway for the gut microbiota to modulate brain function of its host the postnatal microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract results in a longlasting impact on the neural processing of sensory information regarding the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis stress response early postnatal bacterial colonization in germ free gf mice contribute the development of central nervous system a recent study showed that mice whose diets were supplemented with the bifidobacterium breve show elevated concentrations of fatty acids in the brain including arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid which are known to play important roles in neurodevelopmental processes including neurogenesis  the cfos activation in the paraventricular nucleus was rapidly induced by the inoculation of bifidobacterium infantis tryptophan metabolism was modulated by b infantis suggesting that the normal gut microbiota can influence the precursor pool for serotonin which is correlated to neurophysiological behavior anxietylike behavior and central neurochemical changes were relieved in gf mice compared with specific pathogen free spf mice in addition organisms from the bacterial genus clostridium were found at an elevated level in the stools of children with autism compared to the stools of the children without  it has been shown that colonization by gut microbiota impacts mammalian brain development by initiating signaling mechanisms that affect neuronal circuits involved in motor control and anxiety behavior using measures of motor activity and anxietylike behavior scientists demonstrate that gf mice display increased motor activity and reduced anxiety compared with spf mice with a normal gut microbiota this behavioral phenotype is associated with altered expression of genes known to be involved in second messenger pathways and synaptic longterm potentiation in brain regions implicated in motor control and anxietylike behavior   during birth the microbial colonization contributes to the development of epithelial barrier function gut homeostasis angiogenesis innate adaptive immune function and common neurodevelopmental disorders autism schizophrenia compared to the spf mice the gf mice illustrated increased motor activity reduced anxietylike behavior altered expression of synaptic plasticityrelated genes elevated noradrenaline dopamine and 5hydroxytryptamine turnover in the striatum the striate nucleus is part of the cerebrum of the brain and is involved in a number of different cognitive processes when spf mice are exposed to antibiotics gastrointestinal infections and stress sharp changes in diet the gut homeostasis and the central nervous system becomes imbalanced therefore antibiotic drugs suggest a role for the gut microbiota in the regulation of anxiety mood cognition and pain visceral pain can happen in the gut because of gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs  the perception of visceral pain involves sensory nerves on a peripheral sensitization and cortical and subcortical pathways on a central level in addition there is substantial overlap in the brain areas underlying visceral pain and those that are involved in the processing of psychological stress imaging studies in humans with ibs    and in animal models    have shown increased activation of the same brain area clinically it has been shown that visceral pain perception can be affected by intestinal microbiota for example lactobacilli and bifidobacteria can reduce visceral pain induced by stress and ibs    in humans and mice and many different probiotics have been shown to have beneficial effects in humans with abdominal pain   some probiotics can apparently help reduce anxiety stress and mood of patients with ibs and chronic fatigue but the mechanisms of action of such effects currently remain unclear and may involve a combination of neural immune and endocrine effects lactobacillus reuteri probiotic is known to modulate the immune system decrease anxiety and reduce the stressinduced increase of corticosterone other probiotics can lower inflammatory cytokines decrease oxidative stress and improve nutritional status  the liver plays a dominant role in blood glucose homeostasis by maintaining a balance between the uptake and storage of glucose through the metabolic pathways of glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis in recent studies it is illustrated that intestinal lipids regulate glucose homeostasis involving a gutbrainliver axis the direct administration of lipids into the upper intestine increases the long chain fatty acylcoenzyme a lcfacoa levels in the upper intestines and suppresses glucose production even under sub diaphragmatic vagotomy or gut vagal deafferentation this interrupts the neural connection between the brain and the gut and blocks the upper intestinal lipids ability to inhibit glucose production the gutbrainliver axis and gut microbiota composition can regulate the glucose homeostasis in the liver and provide potential therapeutic methods to treat obesity and diabetes

V the coccyx \u02c8k\u0252ks\u026aks koksiks plural coccyges or coccyxes commonly referred to as the tailbone is the final segment of the vertebral column in humans and apes and certain other mammals such as horses in animals with bony tails it is known as tailhead or dock in bird anatomy as tailfan it comprises three to five separate or fused coccygeal vertebrae below the sacrum attached to the sacrum by a fibrocartilaginous joint the sacrococcygeal symphysis which permits limited movement between the sacrum and the coccyx   the coccyx is formed of either three four or five rudimentary vertebrae it articulates superiorly with the sacrum in each of the first three segments may be traced a rudimentary body and articular and transverse processes the last piece sometimes the third is a mere nodule of bone the transverse processes are most prominent and noticeable on the first coccygeal segment all the segments lack pedicles laminae and spinous processes the first is the largest it resembles the lowest sacral vertebra and often exists as a separate piece the remaining ones diminish in size from above downward most anatomy books incorrectly state that the coccyx is normally fused in adults in fact it has been shown that the coccyx may consist of up to five separate bony segments the most common configuration being two or three segments   the anterior surface is slightly concave and marked with three transverse grooves that indicate the junctions of the different segments it gives attachment to the anterior sacrococcygeal ligament and the levatores ani and supports part of the rectum the posterior surface is convex marked by transverse grooves similar to those on the anterior surface and presents on either side a linear row of tuberclesthe rudimentary articular processes of the coccygeal vertebrae of these the superior pair are the largest and are called the coccygeal cornua they project upward and articulate with the cornua of the sacrum and on either side complete the foramen for the transmission of the posterior division of the fifth sacral nerve the lateral borders are thin and exhibit a series of small eminences which represent the transverse processes of the coccygeal vertebrae of these the first is the largest it is flattened from before backward and often ascends to join the lower part of the thin lateral edge of the sacrum thus completing the foramen for the transmission of the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve the others diminish in size from above downward and are often wanting the borders of the coccyx are narrow and give attachment on either side to the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments to the coccygeus in front of the ligaments and to the gluteus maximus behind them the apex is rounded and has attached to it the tendon of the sphincter ani externus it may be bifid the extensor coccygis is a slender muscular fasciculus which is not always present it extends over the lower part of the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx it arises by tendinous fibers from the last segment of the sacrum or first piece of the coccyx and passes downward to be inserted into the lower part of the coccyx it is a rudiment of the extensor muscle of the caudal vertebrae of the lower animals the joints are variable and may be 1 synovial joints 2 thin discs of fibrocartilage 3 intermediate between these two 4 ossified   in humans and other tailless primates eg great apes since nacholapithecus a miocene hominoid   the coccyx is the remnant of a vestigial tail but still not entirely useless  it is an important attachment for various muscles tendons and ligamentswhich makes it necessary for physicians and patients to pay special attention to these attachments when considering surgical removal of the coccyx  additionally it is also a part of the weightbearing tripod structure which acts as a support for a sitting person when a person sits leaning forward the ischial tuberosities and inferior rami of the ischium take most of the weight but as the sitting person leans backward more weight is transferred to the coccyx  the anterior side of the coccyx serves for the attachment of a group of muscles important for many functions of the pelvic floor ie defecation continence etc the levator ani muscle which include coccygeus iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus through the anococcygeal raphe the coccyx supports the position of the anus attached to the posterior side is gluteus maximus which extend the thigh during ambulation  many important ligaments attach to the coccyx the anterior and posterior sacrococcygeal ligaments are the continuations of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments that stretches along the entire spine  additionally the lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments complete the foramina for the last sacral nerve  and lastly some fibers of the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments arising from the spine of the ischium and the ischial tuberosity respectively also attach to the coccyx  an extension of the pia mater the filum terminale extends from the apex of the conus and inserts on the coccyx injuring the coccyx can give rise to a painful condition called coccydynia and one or more of the bones or the connections thereof may be broken fractured tailbone    a number of tumors are known to involve the coccyx of these the most common is sacrococcygeal teratoma both coccydynia and coccygeal tumors may require surgical removal of the coccyx coccygectomy one complication of coccygectomy is a coccygeal hernia  the term coccyx is derived from the ancient greek word \u03ba\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03c5\u03be  kokkux meaning cuckoo  k\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03c5\u03be is attested in the writings of the greek physician herophilus to denote the end of the vertebral column  this greek name for the cuckoo was applied as the last three or four bones of the coccyx resemble the beak of this bird     when viewed from the side   this established etymological explanation can also be found in the writings of the 16th century anatomist andreas vesalius whom wrote os cuculi a similitudine rostri cuculi avis   the cuckoo bone shows a likeness to the beak of the cuckoo bird vesalius used the latin expression os cuculi with os bone  and cuculus the latin name for the cuckoo  the 16th17th century french anatomist jean riolan the younger gives a rather hilarious etymological explanation as he writes quia crepitus qui per sedimentum exeunt ad is os allisi cuculi vocis similitudinem effingunt   because the sound of the farts that leave the anus and dash against this bone shows a likeness to the call of the cuckoo the latter is not considered as potential candidate   besides os cuculi os caudae   with caudae of the tail  is attested this latin expression might be the source of the english french language german and dutch terms tailbone los de la queue  schwanzbein    and staartbeen  in the current official anatomic latin nomenclature terminologia anatomica  coccyx and os coccygis is used vertebral column vertebral column left levator ani from within median sagittal section of male pelvis median sagittal section

V the urinary bladder is the organ that collects urine excreted by the kidneys before disposal by urination a hollow  muscular and distensible or elastic organ the bladder sits on the pelvic floor urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra there is no exact measurement for the volume of the human bladder but different sources mention 500 ml 17 oz to 1000 ml 34 oz    the detrusor muscle is a layer of the urinary bladder wall made of smooth muscle fibers arranged in spiral longitudinal and circular bundles when the bladder is stretched this signals the parasympathetic nervous system to contract the detrusor muscle this encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra a metaanalysis on the effect of voiding position on urodynamics in males found that sitting down allows for improved contraction of the detrusor muscle  the fundus of the bladder is the base of the bladder formed by the posterior wall it is lymphatically drained by the external iliac lymph nodes the peritoneum lies superior to the fundus the bladder receives motor innervation from both sympathetic fibers most of which arise from the hypogastric plexuses and nerves and parasympathetic fibers which come from the pelvic splanchnic nerves and the inferior hypogastric plexus  sensation from the bladder is transmitted to the central nervous system cns via general visceral afferent fibers gva gva fibers on the superior surface follow the course of the sympathetic efferent nerves back to the cns while gva fibers on the inferior portion of the bladder follow the course of the parasympathetic efferents  for the urine to exit the bladder both the autonomically controlled internal sphincter and the voluntarily controlled external sphincter must be opened problems with these muscles can lead to incontinence  the urinary bladder is lined with transitional epithelium it does not produce mucus  the internal lining of the bladder wall is termed the urothelium and lamina propria and this layer is thought to regulate some aspects of the overall bladder physiology in response to stimuli such as stretch during filling  vertical section of bladder wall layers of the urinary bladder wall and cross section of the detrusor muscle the human urinary bladder is derived in embryo from the urogenital sinus and it is initially continuous with the allantois in males the base of the bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic symphysis it is superior to the prostate and separated from the rectum by the rectovesical excavation in females the bladder sits inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina thus its maximum capacity is lower than in males it is separated from the uterus by the vesicouterine excavation in infants and young children the urinary bladder is in the abdomen even when empty  urine excreted by the kidneys collects in the bladder before disposal by urination the urinary bladder usually holds 300350 ml of urine as urine accumulates the rugae flatten and the wall of the bladder thins as it stretches allowing the bladder to store larger amounts of urine without a significant rise in internal pressure  frequent urination can be due to excessive urine production small bladder capacity irritability or incomplete emptying males with an enlarged prostate urinate more frequently one definition of overactive bladder is when a person urinates more than eight times per day  though there can be other causes of urination frequency  though both urinary frequency and volumes have been shown to have a circadian rhythm meaning day and night cycles  it is not entirely clear how these are disturbed in the overactive bladder disorders of or related to the bladder include bladders occur throughout much of the animal kingdom but are very diverse in form  and in some cases are not homologous with the urinary bladder in humans  the pig bladder is very similar to the human bladder median sagittal section of female pelvis the peritoneum of the male pelvis median sagitta section of male pelvis vertical section of bladder penis and urethra the interior of bladder fundus of the bladder with the vesiculæ seminales female pelvis and its contents seen from above and in front the bladder can be seen highlighted in yellow in the illustration

V mammary intercourse is a sex act performed as either foreplay or as nonpenetrative sex that involves the stimulation of the male penis by the female breasts and vice versa    mammary intercourse involves the male placing his erect penis in the females cleavage then start rubbing or thrusting between her breasts while the breasts are squeezed around the penile shaft creating a tight area for stimulation  in addition the woman may move her breasts up and down against the penis for an additional stimulation the act may be carried out face to face or head to tail with the woman recommended to be on top if she has smaller breasts  when performed as a nonpenetrative sex act the act is continued until the man achieves orgasm mammary intercourse is said by alex comfort to produce mutual orgasm in women with sensitive breasts what margot anand terms local orgasms of the breast   and it was one of the nine substitute exercises for penetrative sexual activities as detailed in the paradis charnels of 1903  this act can be combined with fellatio since mammary intercourse is a nonpenetrative sex act the risk of passing a sexually transmitted infection sti that requires direct contact between the mucous membranes and preejaculate or semen is greatly reduced hiv is among the infections that require such direct contact and is therefore very unlikely to be transmitted via mammary intercourse  a study of the condom usage habits of new zealands sex workers said that they offered various safe sex alternatives to vaginal sex to clients who refused to wear a condom one sex worker said that mammary intercourse was one alternative used mammary intercourse performed by a woman with large breasts felt to the client like penetrative vaginal sex  mammary intercourse has sometimes been considered a perversion  freud however considered such extensions of sexual interest to fall within the range of the normal unless marked out by exclusivity ie the repudiation of all other forms of sexual contact  mammary intercourse is known as tittyfucking titfuck titjob or a boob job in the united states as well as tit wank or french fuck in the united kingdom   the latter term dating back to the 1930s while a more jocular equivalent is a trip down mammary lane  the japanese sex industry uses the term paizuri \u30d1\u30a4\u30ba\u30ea \u30d1\u30a4 is from \u304a\u3063\u3071\u3044 oppai a slang word for breast while \u30ba\u30ea is from \u64e6\u308a zuri rub

V the human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion the tongue salivary glands pancreas liver and gallbladder in this system the process of digestion has many stages the first of which starts in the mouth oral cavity digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components which can be absorbed and assimilated into the body the secretion of saliva helps to produce a bolus which can be swallowed to pass down the oesophagus and into the stomach saliva also contains a catalytic enzyme called amylase which starts to act on food in the mouth another digestive enzyme called lingual lipase is secreted by some of the lingual papillae on the tongue and also from serous glands in the main salivary glands digestion is helped by the mastication of food by the teeth and also by the muscular actions of peristalsis and segmentation contractions gastric juice in the stomach is essential for the continuation of digestion as is the production of mucus in the stomach peristalsis is the rhythmic contraction of muscles that begins in the oesophagus and continues along the wall of the stomach and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract this initially results in the production of chyme which when fully broken down in the small intestine is absorbed as chyle into the lymphatic system most of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine water and some minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon of the large intestine the waste products of digestion are defecated from the anus via the rectum   there are several organs and other components involved in the digestion of food the organs known as the accessory digestive glands are the liver gall bladder and pancreas other components include the mouth teeth and epiglottis the largest structure of the digestive system is the gastrointestinal tract gi tract this starts at the mouth and ends at the anus covering a distance of about nine 9 metres  the largest part of the gi tract is the colon or large intestine water is absorbed here and remaining waste matter is stored prior to defecation  most of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine a major digestive organ is the stomach within its mucosa are millions of embedded gastric glands their secretions are vital to the functioning of the organ there are many specialised cells of the gi tract these include the various cells of the gastric glands taste cells pancreatic duct cells enterocytes and microfold cells the mouth is the first part of the gastrointestinal tract and is equipped with several structures that begin the first processes of digestion  these include salivary glands teeth and the tongue the mouth consists of two regions the vestibule and the oral cavity proper the vestibule is the area between the teeth lips and cheeks  and the rest is the oral cavity proper most of the oral cavity is lined with oral mucosa a mucous membrane that produces a lubricating mucus of which only a small amount is needed mucous membranes vary in structure in the different regions of the body but they all produce a lubricating mucus which is either secreted by surface cells or more usually by underlying glands the mucous membrane in the mouth continues as the thin mucosa which lines the bases of the teeth the main component of mucus is a glycoprotein called mucin and the type secreted varies according to the region involved mucin is viscous clear and clinging underlying the mucous membrane in the mouth is a thin layer of smooth muscle tissue and the loose connection to the membrane gives it its great elasticity  it covers the cheeks inner surfaces of the lips and floor of the mouth  the roof of the mouth is termed the palate and it separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity the palate is hard at the front of the mouth since the overlying mucosa is covering a plate of bone it is softer and more pliable at the back being made of muscle and connective tissue and it can move to swallow food and liquids the soft palate ends at the uvula  the surface of the hard palate allows for the pressure needed in eating food to leave the nasal passage clear  the lips are the mouths front boundary and the fauces the passageway between the tonsils also called the throat mark its posterior boundary at either side of the soft palate are the palatoglossus muscles which also reach into regions of the tongue these muscles raise the back of the tongue and also close both sides of the fauces to enable food to be swallowed  mucus helps in the mastication of food in its ability to soften and collect the food in the formation of the bolus there are three pairs of main salivary glands and between 800 and 1000 minor salivary glands all of which mainly serve the digestive process and also play an important role in the maintenance of dental health and general mouth lubrication without which speech would be impossible  the main glands are all exocrine glands secreting via ducts all of these glands terminate in the mouth the largest of these are the parotid glands  their secretion is mainly serous the next pair are underneath the jaw the submandibular glands these produce both serous fluid and mucus the serous fluid is produced by serous glands in these salivary glands which also produce lingual lipase they produce about 70 of the oral cavity saliva the third pair are the sublingual glands located underneath the tongue and their secretion is mainly mucous with a small percentage of saliva within the oral mucosa a mucous membrane lining the mouth and also on the tongue and palates and mouth floor are the minor salivary glands their secretions are mainly mucous and are innervated by the facial nerve the seventh cranial nerve  the glands also secrete amylase a first stage in the breakdown of food acting on the carbohydrate in the food to transform the starch content into maltose there are other glands on the surface of the tongue that encircle taste buds on the back part of the tongue and these also produce lingual lipase lipase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of lipids fats these glands are termed von ebners glands which have also been shown to have another function in the secretion of histatins which offer an early defense outside of the immune system against microbes in food when it makes contact with these glands on the tongue tissue   sensory information can stimulate the secretion of saliva providing the necessary fluid for the tongue to work with and also to ease swallowing of the food saliva functions initially in the digestive system to moisten and soften food into the formation of a bolus the bolus is further helped by the lubrication provided by the saliva in its passage from the mouth into the oesophagus also of importance is the presence in saliva of the digestive enzymes amylase and lipase amylase starts to work on the starch in carbohydrates breaking it down into the simple sugars of maltose and dextrose that can be further broken down in the small intestine saliva in the mouth can account for 30 of this initial starch digestion lipase starts to work on breaking down fats lipase is further produced in the pancreas where it is released to continue this digestion of fats the presence of salivary lipase is of prime importance in young babies whose pancreatic lipase has yet to be developed  as well as its role in supplying digestive enzymes saliva has a cleansing action for the teeth and mouth  it also has an immunological role in supplying antibodies to the system such as immunoglobulin a  this is seen to be key in preventing infections of the salivary glands importantly that of parotitis saliva also contains a glycoprotein called haptocorrin which is a binding protein to vitamin b12  it binds with the vitamin in order to carry it safely through the acidic content of the stomach when it reaches the duodenum pancreatic enzymes break down the glycoprotein and free the vitamin which then binds with intrinsic factor food enters the mouth where the first stage in the digestive process takes place with the action of the tongue and the secretion of saliva the tongue is a fleshy and muscular sensory organ and the very first sensory information is received via the taste buds on its surface if the taste is agreeable the tongue will go into action manipulating the food in the mouth which stimulates the secretion of saliva from the salivary glands the liquid quality of the saliva will help in the softening of the food and its enzyme content will start to break down the food whilst it is still in the mouth the first part of the food to be broken down is the starch of carbohydrates the tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth by a ligamentous band called the frenum  and this gives it great mobility for the manipulation of food and speech the range of manipulation is optimally controlled by the action of several muscles and limited in its external range by the stretch of the frenum the tongues two sets of muscles are four intrinsic muscles that originate in the tongue and are involved with its shaping and four extrinsic muscles originating in bone that are involved with its movement taste is a form of chemoreception that takes place in the specialised receptors of taste cells contained in structures called taste buds in the mouth taste buds are mainly on the upper surface dorsum of the tongue taste perception is vital to help prevent harmful or rotten foods from being consumed this is a function of the gustatory system where the taste buds are at the forefront there are taste buds elsewhere in the mouth not just on the surface of the tongue the taste buds are innervated by a branch of the facial nerve the chorda tympani and the glossopharyngeal nerve taste messages are sent via these cranial nerves to the brain the brain can distinguish between the chemical qualities of the food the five basic tastes are referred to as those of saltiness sourness bitterness and sweetness and the most recent addition of a certain savouriness termed umami the detection of saltiness and sourness enables the control of salt and acid balance the detection of bitterness warns of poisons  many of a plants defences are of poisonous compounds that are bitter sweetness guides to those foods that will supply energy the initial breakdown of the energygiving carbohydrates by salivary amylase creates the taste of sweetness since simple sugars are the first result the taste of umami is thought to signal proteinrich food sour tastes are acidic which is often found in bad food the brain has to decide very quickly whether to eat the food or not it was the findings in 1991 describing the first olfactory receptors that helped to prompt the research into taste the olfactory receptors are located on cell surfaces in the nose which bind to chemicals enabling the detection of smells it is assumed that signals from taste receptors work together with the signals from those in the nose to form an idea of complex food flavours  teeth are complex structures made of materials specific to them they are made of a bonelike material called dentin which is covered by the hardest tissue in the bodyenamel  teeth have different shapes to deal with different aspects of mastication employed in tearing and chewing pieces of food into smaller and smaller pieces this results in a much larger surface area for the action of digestive enzymes the teeth are named after their particular roles in the process of masticationincisors are used for cutting or biting off pieces of food canines are used for tearing premolars and molars are used for chewing and grinding mastication of the food with the help of saliva and mucus results in the formation of a soft bolus which can then be swallowed to make its way down the upper gastrointestinal tract to the stomach  the digestive enzymes in saliva also help in keeping the teeth clean by breaking down any lodged food particles the epiglottis is a flap that is made of elastic cartilage and attached to the entrance of the larynx it is covered with a mucous membrane and there are taste buds on its lingual surface which faces into the mouth  its laryngeal surface faces into the larynx the epiglottis functions to guard the entrance of the glottis the opening between the vocal folds it is normally pointed upward during breathing with its underside functioning as part of the pharynx but during swallowing the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position with its upper side functioning as part of the pharynx in this manner it prevents food from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the oesophagus which is posterior during swallowing the backward motion of the tongue forces the epiglottis over the glottis opening to prevent any food that is being swallowed from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs the larynx is also pulled upwards to assist this process stimulation of the larynx by ingested matter produces a strong cough reflex in order to protect the lungs the pharynx is a part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system and also a part of the digestive system it is the part of the throat immediately behind the nasal cavity at the back of the mouth and above the oesophagus and larynxthe pharynx is made up of three parts the lower two partsthe oropharynx and the laryngopharynx are involved in the digestive system the laryngopharynx connects to the oesophagus and it serves as a passageway for both air and food air enters the larynx anteriorly but anything swallowed has priority and the passage of air is temporarily blocked the pharynx is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus of the vagus nerve  muscles in the pharynx push the food into the oesophagusthe pharynx joins the oesophagus at the oesophageal inlet which is located behind the cricoid cartilage the oesophagus commonly known as the gullet is an organ which consists of a muscular tube through which food passes from the pharynx to the stomach the oesophagus is continuous with the laryngeal part of the pharynx it passes through the posterior mediastinum in the thorax and enters the stomach through a hole in the thoracic diaphragmthe oesophageal hiatus at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra t10 its length averages 25cm varying with height it is divided into cervical thoracic and abdominal parts the pharynx joins the oesophagus at the oesophageal inlet which is behind the cricoid cartilage at rest the oesophagus is closed at both ends by the upper and lower oesophageal sphincters the opening of the upper sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex so that food is allowed through the sphincter also serves to prevent back flow from the oesophagus into the pharynx the oesophagus has a mucous membrane and the epithelium which has a protective function is continuously replaced due to the volume of food that passes inside the oesophagus during swallowing food passes from the mouth through the pharynx into the oesophagus the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position so as to prevent food from going into the trachea instead directing it to the oesophagus once in the oesophagus the bolus travels down to the stomach via rhythmic contraction and relaxation of muscles known as peristalsis the lower oesophageal sphincter is a muscular sphincter surrounding the lower part of the oesophagus the junction between the oesophagus and the stomach the gastroesophageal junction is controlled by the lower oesophageal sphincter which remains constricted at all times other than during swallowing and vomiting to prevent the contents of the stomach from entering the oesophagus as the oesophagus does not have the same protection from acid as the stomach any failure of this sphincter can lead to heartburn the oesophagus has a mucous membrane of epithelium which has a protective function as well as providing a smooth surface for the passage of food due to the high volume of food that is passed over time this membrane is continuously renewed the diaphragm is an important part of the bodys digestive system the diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity where most of the digestive organs are located the suspensory muscle attaches the ascending duodenum to the diaphragm this muscle is thought to be of help in the digestive system in that its attachment offers a wider angle to the duodenojejunal flexure for the easier passage of digesting material the diaphragm also attaches to the bare area of the liver which it anchors the oesophagus enters the abdomen through a hole in the diaphragm at the level of t10 gastric acid informally gastric juice produced in the stomach plays a vital role in the digestive process it mainly contains hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride a peptide hormone gastrin produced by g cells in the gastric glands stimulates the production of gastric juice which activates the digestive enzymes pepsinogen is a precursor enzyme zymogen produced by the gastric chief cells and gastric acid activates this to the enzyme pepsin which begins the digestion of proteins as these two chemicals would damage the stomach wall mucus is secreted by innumerable gastric glands in the stomach to provide a slimy protective layer against the damaging effects of the chemicals at the same time that protein is being digested mechanical churning occurs through the action of peristalsis waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall this allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes gastric lipase secreted by the chief cells in the fundic glands in the gastric mucosa of the stomach is an acidic lipase in contrast with the alkaline pancreatic lipase this breaks down fats to some degree though is not as efficient as the pancreatic lipase the pylorus the lowest section of the stomach which attaches to the duodenum via the pyloric canal contains countless glands which secrete digestive enzymes including gastrin after an hour or two a thick semiliquid called chyme is produced when the pyloric sphincter or valve opens chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes further with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and then passes through the small intestine where digestion continues when the chyme is fully digested it is absorbed into the blood 95 of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon of the large intestine where the environment is slightly acidic some vitamins such as biotin and vitamin k produced by bacteria in the gut flora of the colon are also absorbed the parietal cells in the fundus of the stomach produce a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor which is essential for the absorption of vitamin b12 vitamin b12 cobalamin is carried to and through the stomach bound to a glycoprotein secreted by the salivary glands  transcobalamin i also called haptocorrin which protects the acidsensitive vitamin from the acidic stomach contents once in the more neutral duodenum pancreatic enzymes break down the protective glycoprotein the freed vitamin b12 then binds to intrinsic factor which is then absorbed by the enterocytes in the ileum the stomach is a distensible organ and can normally expand to hold about one litre of food  the stomach of a newborn baby will only be able to expand to retain about 30 ml the spleen breaks down both red and white blood cells that are spent this is why it is sometimes known as the graveyard of red blood cells  a product of this digestion is the pigment bilirubin which is sent to the liver and secreted in the bile another product is iron which is used in the formation of new blood cells in the bone marrow  western medicine treats the spleen solely as belonging to the lymphatic system though it is acknowledged that the full range of its important functions is not yet understood  in contrast to this view traditional chinese medicine sees the spleen to be of central importance in the digestive system the role of the spleen is seen to affect the health and vitality of the body in its turning of digested material from the stomach into usable nutrients and energy symptoms that include poor appetite indigestion bloating and jaundice are seen to be indications of an imbalance in the spleen the spleen is further seen to play a part in the metabolism of water in ridding the body of excess fluid  in the west the spleen is seen to be paired with the stomach but in chinese medicine reference is made to the spleen system which involves the pancreas fluids in the body are seen in traditional chinese medicine to be under the control of the spleen fluids include digestive enzymes saliva mucus fluid in the joints tears sweat and urine they are categorised as thin and thick and together they are seen as nourishing all tissues and organs in acupuncture two widely used acupuncture points  the stomach close to the knee and the spleen halfway down from the knee have long been seen to be connected and involved in digestive issues the liver is the second largest organ after the skin and is an accessory digestive gland which plays a role in the bodys metabolism the liver has many functions some of which are important to digestion the liver can detoxify various metabolites synthesise proteins and produce biochemicals needed for digestion it regulates the storage of glycogen which it can form from glucose glycogenesis the liver can also synthesise glucose from certain amino acids its digestive functions are largely involved with the breaking down of carbohydrates it also maintains protein metabolism in its synthesis and degradation in lipid metabolism it synthesises cholesterol fats are also produced in the process of lipogenesis the liver synthesises the bulk of lipoproteinsthe liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and below the diaphragm to which it is attached at one part this is to the right of the stomach and it overlies the gall bladder the liver produces bile an important alkaline compound which aids digestion bile produced by the liver is made up of water 97 bile salts mucus and pigments 1 fats and inorganic salts  bilirubin is its major pigment bile acts partly as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension between either two liquids or a solid and a liquid and helps to emulsify the fats in the chyme food fat is dispersed by the action of bile into smaller units called micelles the breaking down into micelles creates a much larger surface area for the pancreatic enzyme lipase to work on lipase digests the triglycerides which are broken down into two fatty acids and a monoglyceride these are then absorbed by villi on the intestinal wall if fats are not absorbed in this way in the small intestine problems can arise later in the large intestine which is not equipped to absorb fats bile also helps in the absorption of vitamin k from the diet bile is collected and delivered through the common hepatic duct this duct joins with the cystic duct to connect in a common bile duct with the gallbladder bile is stored in the gallbladder for release when food is discharged into the duodenum and also after a few hours  the gallbladder is a hollow part of the biliary system that sits just beneath the liver with the gallbladder body resting in a small depression  it is a small organ where the bile produced by the liver is stored before being released into the small intestine bile flows from the liver through the bile ducts and into the gall bladder for storage the bile is released in response to cholecystokinin ckk a peptide hormone released from the duodenum the production of ckk by endocrine cells of the duodenum is stimulated by the presence of fat in the duodenum  it is divided into three sections a fundus body and neck the neck tapers and connects to the biliary tree via the cystic duct which then joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct at this junction is a mucosal fold called hartmanns pouch where gallstones commonly get stuck the muscular layer of the body is of smooth muscle tissue that helps the gallbladder contract so that it can discharge its bile into the bile duct the gallbladder needs to store bile in a natural semiliquid form at all times hydrogen ions secreted from the inner lining of the gallbladder keep the bile acidic enough to prevent hardening to dilute the bile water and electrolytes from the digestion system are added also salts attach themselves to cholesterol molecules in the bile to keep them from crystallising if there is too much cholesterol or bilirubin in the bile or if the gallbladder doesnt empty properly the systems can fail this is how gallstones form when a small piece of calcium gets coated with either cholesterol or bilirubin and the bile crystallises and forms a gallstone the main purpose of the gallbladder is to store and release bile or gall bile is released into the small intestine in order to help in the digestion of fats by breaking down larger molecules into smaller ones after the fat is absorbed the bile is also absorbed and transported back to the liver for reuse the pancreas is a major organ functioning as an accessory digestive gland in the digestive system it is both an endocrine gland and an exocrine gland  the endocrine part secretes insulin when the blood sugar becomes high insulin moves glucose from the blood into the muscles and other tissues for use as energy the endocrine part releases glucagon when the blood sugar is low glucagon allows stored sugar to be broken down into glucose by the liver in order to rebalance the sugar levels the pancreas produces and releases important digestive enzymes in the pancreatic juice that it delivers to the duodenum the pancreas lies below and at the back of the stomach it connects to the duodenum via the pancreatic duct which it joins near to the bile ducts connection where both the bile and pancreatic juice can act on the chyme that is released from the stomach into the duodenum aqueous pancreatic secretions from pancreatic duct cells contain bicarbonate ions which are alkaline and help with the bile to neutralise the acidic chyme that is churned out by the stomach the pancreas is also the main source of enzymes for the digestion of fats and proteins some of these are released in response to the production of ckk in the duodenum the enzymes that digest polysaccharides by contrast are primarily produced by the walls of the intestines the cells are filled with secretory granules containing the precursor digestive enzymes the major proteases the pancreatic enzymes which work on proteins are trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen elastase is also produced smaller amounts of lipase and amylase are secreted the pancreas also secretes phospholipase a2 lysophospholipase and cholesterol esterase the precursor zymogens are inactive variants of the enzymes which avoids the onset of pancreatitis caused by autodegradation once released in the intestine the enzyme enteropeptidase present in the intestinal mucosa activates trypsinogen by cleaving it to form trypsin further cleavage results in chymotripsin the lower gastrointestinal tract gi includes the small intestine and all of the large intestine  the intestine is also called the bowel or the gut the lower gi starts at the pyloric sphincter of the stomach and finishes at the anus the small intestine is subdivided into the duodenum the jejunum and the ileum the caecum marks the division between the small and large intestine the large intestine includes the rectum and anal canal   food starts to arrive in the small intestine one hour after it is eaten and after two hours the stomach has emptied until this time the food is termed a bolus it then becomes the partially digested semiliquid termed chyme in the small intestine the ph becomes crucial it needs to be finely balanced in order to activate digestive enzymes the chyme is very acidic with a low ph having been released from the stomach and needs to be made much more alkaline this is achieved in the duodenum by the addition of bile from the gall bladder combined with the bicarbonate secretions from the pancreatic duct and also from secretions of bicarbonaterich mucus from duodenal glands known as brunners glands the chyme arrives in the intestines having been released from the stomach through the opening of the pyloric sphincter the resulting alkaline fluid mix neutralises the gastric acid which would damage the lining of the intestine the mucus component lubricates the walls of the intestine when the digested food particles are reduced enough in size and composition they can be absorbed by the intestinal wall and carried to the bloodstream the first receptacle for this chyme is the duodenal bulb from here it passes into the first of the three sections of the small intestine the duodenum the next section is the jejunum and the third is the ileum the duodenum is the first and shortest section of the small intestine it is a hollow jointed cshaped tube connecting the stomach to the jejunum it starts at the duodenal bulb and ends at the suspensory muscle of duodenum the attachment of the suspensory muscle to the diaphragm is thought to help the passage of food by making a wider angle at its attachment most food digestion takes place in the small intestine in the duodenum pancreatic lipase is secreted together with a coenzyme colipase to further digest the fat content of the chyme from this breakdown smaller particles of emulsified fats called chylomicrons are produced there are also digestive cells called enterocytes lining the intestines the majority being in the small intestine they are unusual cells in that they have villi on their surface which in turn have innumerable microvilli on their surface all these villi make for a greater surface area not only for the absorption of chyme but also for its further digestion by large numbers of digestive enzymes present on the microvilli the cholymicrons are small enough to pass through the enterocyte villi and into their lymph capillaries called lacteals a milky fluid called chyle consisting mainly of the emulsified fats of the cholymicrons results from the absorbed mix with the lymph in the lacteals chyle is then transported through the lymphatic system to the rest of the body the suspensory muscle marks the end of the duodenum and the division between the upper gastrointestinal tract and the lower gi tract the digestive tract continues as the jejunum which continues as the ileum the jejunum the midsection of the small intestine contains circular folds flaps of doubled mucosal membrane which partially encircle and sometimes completely encircle the lumen of the intestine these folds together with villi serve to increase the surface area of the jejunum enabling an increased absorption of digested sugars amino acids and fatty acids into the bloodstream the circular folds also slow the passage of food giving more time for nutrients to be absorbed the last part of the small intestine is the ileum this also contains villi and vitamin b12 bile acids and any residue nutrients are absorbed here when the chyme is exhausted of its nutrients the remaining waste material changes into the semisolids called faeces which pass to the large intestine where bacteria in the gut flora further break down residual proteins and starches   the caecum is a pouch marking the division between the small intestine and the large intestine  the caecum receives chyme from the last part of the small intestine the terminal ileum and connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine at this junction there is a sphincter or valve the ileocecal valve which slows the passage of chyme from the ileum allowing further digestion it is also the site of the appendix attachment in the large intestine the passage of the digesting food in the colon is a lot slower taking from 12 to 50 hours until it is removed by defecation the colon mainly serves as a site for the fermentation of digestible matter by the gut flora the time taken varies considerably between individuals the remaining semisolid waste is termed faeces and is removed by the coordinated contractions of the intestinal walls termed peristalsis which propels the excreta forward to reach the rectum and exit via defecation from the anus the wall has an outer layer of longitudinal muscles the taeniae coli and an inner layer of circular muscles the circular muscle keeps the material moving forward and also prevents any back flow of waste also of help in the action of peristalsis is the basal electrical rhythm that determines the frequency of contractions  the taeniae coli can be seen and are responsible for the bulges haustra present in the colon most parts of the gi tract are covered with serous membranes and have a mesentery other more muscular parts are lined with adventitia the digestive system is supplied by the celiac artery the celiac artery is the first major branch from the abdominal aorta and is the only major artery that nourishes the digestive organs there are three main divisions  the left gastric artery the common hepatic artery and the splenic artery the celiac artery supplies the liver stomach spleen and the upper 13 of the duodenum to the sphincter of oddi and the pancreas with oxygenated blood most of the blood is returned to the liver via the portal venous system for further processing and detoxification before returning to the systemic circulation via the hepatic portal vein the next branch from the abdominal aorta is the superior mesenteric artery which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived from the midgut which includes the distal 23 of the duodenum jejunum ileum caecum appendix ascending colon and the proximal 23 of the transverse colon the final branch which is important for the digestive system is the inferior mesenteric artery which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived from the hindgut which includes the distal 13 of the transverse colon descending colon sigmoid colon rectum and the anus above the pectinate line the enteric nervous system consists of some one hundred million neurons  that are embedded in the peritoneum the lining of the gastrointestinal tract extending from the oesophagus to the anus  these neurons are collected into two plexuses  the myenteric or auerbachs plexus that lies between the longitudinal and the smooth muscle layers and the submucosal or meissners plexus that lies between the circular smooth muscle layer and the mucosa    parasympathetic innervation to the ascending colon is supplied by the vagus nerve sympathetic innervation is supplied by the splanchnic nerves that join the celiac ganglia most of the digestive tract is innervated by the two large celiac ganglia with the upper part of each ganglion joined by the greater splanchnic nerve and the lower parts joined by the lesser splanchnic nerve it is from these ganglia that many of the gastric plexuses arise each part of the digestive system is subject to a wide range of disorders a number of problems including malnutrition and anemia can arise from malabsorption the abnormal absorption of nutrients in the gi tract malabsorption can have many causes ranging from infection to enzyme deficiencies such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency it can also arise as a result of other gastrointestinal diseases such as coeliac disease coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine this can cause vitamin deficiencies due to the improper absorption of nutrients in the small intestine in the oesophagus schatzki rings can restrict the passageway causing difficulties in swallowing they can also completely block the oesophagus  a common disorder of the bowel is diverticulitis diverticula are small pouches that can form inside the bowel wall which can become inflamed to give diverticulitis this disease can have complications if an inflamed diverticulum bursts and infection sets in any infection can spread further to the lining of the abdomen peritoneum and cause potentially fatal peritonitis  crohns disease is a common chronic inflammatory bowel disease ibd which can affect any part of the gi tract  but it mostly starts in the terminal ileum ulcerative colitis an ulcerative form of colitis is the other major inflammatory bowel disease which is restricted to the colon and rectum both of these ibds can give an increased risk of the development of colorectal cancer ulcerative coliltis is the most common of the ibds  irritable bowel syndrome ibs is the most common of the functional gastrointestinal disorders these are idiopathic disorders that the rome process has helped to define  giardiasis is a disease of the small intestine caused by a protist parasite giardia lamblia this does not spread but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine  it can often be asymptomatic but as often can be indicated by a variety of symptoms giardiasis is the most common pathogenic parasitic infection in humans  there are diagnostic tools mostly involving the ingestion of barium sulphate to investigate disorders of the gi tract  these are known as upper gastrointestinal series that enable imaging of the pharynx larynx oesophagous stomach and small intestine and lower gastrointestinal series for imaging of the colon neurogastroenterology

V a pencil test is an informal test of breast development and the need to wear a bra conceived by ann landers    a pencil is placed in the inframammary fold between the breast and chest if the pencil does not fall the woman has failed the pencil test and needs to wear a bra the supposition is that breasts that are not pendulous are selfsupporting and do not need the added support of a bra  although no evidence has been offered as to its validity popular culture often considers the test to be a method to determine whether a young girl should begin wearing a bra the theory is that if the girl places a pencil under her breast and if it stays in place then wearing a bra is recommended if it falls to the ground a bra is not yet needed   other more relevant factors when choosing whether to wear a bra include physical support of very large breasts pain when exercising and general comfort which run alongside social pressures such as the desire to present breasts as perky or preventing nipples from being seen through clothing diane brill conceived of her own version of the pencil test which is a test for cleavage in her book boobs boys and high heels or how to get dressed in just under six hours she suggests that women should wear a corset or pushup bra and put a pencil in their cleavage if the pencil doesnt fall the womans cleavage is perfect  some women use the pencil test to determine if their breasts are sagging however some degree of sagging or in medical terms ptosis is normal and natural sagging is partly determined by inherited traits like skin elasticity and breast density which affects the ratio of lightweight fat to heavier mammary glands  some sagging is due to the aging of the glandular tissues that produce breast firmness  the general public and the medical community define sagging differently plastic surgeons categorize the severity of ptosis by evaluating the position of the nipple relative to the inframammary fold the point at which the underside of the breasts attach to the chest wall they dont consider a womans breasts to be sagging unless the nipple is positioned below the inframammary fold in the most advanced stage the nipples are below the fold and point towards the ground  wearing a bra does not prevent breasts from sagging many women mistakenly believe that because breasts cannot anatomically support themselves that wearing a brassiere will prevent their breasts from sagging later in life  researchers bra manufacturers and health professionals cannot find any evidence to support the idea that wearing a bra for any amount of time slows breast ptosis  bra manufacturers are careful to claim that bras only affect the shape of breasts while they are being worn   in 1975 the student senate of the university of texas at austin passed a dress code that among other things made it mandatory for women to wear a bra if they could not pass the pencil test the decision was filibustered by a female senate member and she was physically removed from the room before the vote passed 119  in the film breast men the pencil test was demonstrated by a female performer as a method of determining the desirability of having breast augmentation or breast implants if when placed under the breast against the skin of the torso a pencil does not fall to the ground ie the pencil is held in place by weight of the breast against the skin of the torso augmentation is desirable

V the 10 percent of the brain myth is the widely perpetuated urban legend that most or all humans only make use of 10 percent or some other small percentage of their brains it has been misattributed to many people including albert einstein  by extrapolation it is suggested that a person may harness this unused potential and increase intelligence changes in grey and white matter following new experiences and learning have been shown but it has not yet been proven what the changes are  the popular notion that large parts of the brain remain unused and could subsequently be activated rests in popular folklore and not science though mysteries regarding brain function remaineg memory consciousnessthe physiology of brain mapping suggests that all areas of the brain have a function     one possible origin is the reserve energy theories by harvard psychologists william james and boris sidis in the 1890s who tested the theory in the accelerated raising of child prodigy william sidis thereafter james told audiences that people only meet a fraction of their full mental potential which is a plausible claim  in 1936 american writer lowell thomas summarized this idea in a foreword to dale carnegies how to win friends and influence people by adding a falsely precise percentage professor william james of harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability  this book was not the first to use the 10 percent figure which was already circulating within the selfhelp movement before then for example the book mind myths exploring popular assumptions about the mind and brain includes a chapter on the ten percent myth which shows a selfhelp advertisement from the 1929 world almanac containing the line there is no limit to what the human brain can accomplish scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about ten percent of our brain power  in the 1970s psychologist and educator georgi lozanov proposed the teaching method of suggestopedia believing that we might be using only five to ten percent of our mental capacity   the origin of the myth has also been attributed to wilder penfield the usborn neurosurgeon who was the first director of montreal neurological institute of mcgill university  according to a related origin story the ten percent myth most likely arose from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of neurological research in the late 19th century or early 20th century for example the functions of many brain regions especially in the cerebral cortex are complex enough that the effects of damage are subtle leading early neurologists to wonder what these regions did  the brain was also discovered to consist mostly of glial cells which seemed to have very minor functions dr james w kalat author of the textbook biological psychology points out that neuroscientists in the 1930s knew about the large number of local neurons in the brain the misunderstanding of the function of local neurons may have led to the ten percent myth  the myth might have been propagated simply by a truncation of the idea that some use a small percentage of their brains at any given time  in the same article in scientific american john henley a neurologist at the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota states evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of the brain  although parts of the brain have broadly understood functions many mysteries remain about how brain cells ie neurons and glia work together to produce complex behaviors and disorders perhaps the broadest most mysterious question is how diverse regions of the brain collaborate to form conscious experiences so far there is no evidence that there is one site for consciousness which leads experts to believe that it is truly a collective neural effort therefore as with jamess idea that humans have untapped cognitive potential it may be that a large number of questions about the brain have not been fully answered  neurologist barry gordon describes the myth as false adding we use virtually every part of the brain and that most of the brain is active almost all the time  neuroscientist barry beyerstein sets out seven kinds of evidence refuting the ten percent myth  several books films and short stories have been written closely related to this myth they include the novel the dark fields its film adaptation limitless claiming 20 percent rather than the typical 10 percent and the 2014 film lucy all of which operate under the notion that the rest of the brain could be accessed through use of a drug  lucy in particular depicts a character who gains increasingly godlike abilities once she surpasses 10 percent though the film suggests that 10 percent represents brain capacity at a particular time rather than permanent usage dc comics character deathstroke also is said to be able to utilize 90 of his brain to explain his tactical genius and fighting skill  the myth is busted on an october 27 2010 episode of mythbusters the hosts used magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brain of someone attempting a complicated mental task and found that over 10 but less than 20 of the brain was used  the 10 percent brain myth occurs frequently in advertisements  and in entertainment media it is often cited as if it were fact  some new age proponents propagate the ten percent of the brain belief by asserting that the unused ninety percent of the human brain is capable of exhibiting psychic powers and can be trained to perform psychokinesis and extrasensory perception   there is no scientifically verified body of evidence supporting the existence of such powers

V the visible part of the human nose is the protruding part of the face that bears the nostrils the shape of the nose is determined by the ethmoid bone and the nasal septum which consists mostly of cartilage and which separates the nostrils on average the nose of a male is larger than that of a female  the nasal root is the top of the nose forming an indentation at the suture where the nasal bones meet the frontal bone the anterior nasal spine is the thin projection of bone at the midline on the lower nasal margin holding the cartilaginous center of the nose  adult humans have nasal hairs in the anterior nasal passage   in the upper portion of the nose the paired nasal bones attach to the frontal bone above and to the side superolaterally the paired nasal bones connect to the lacrimal bones and below and to the side inferolaterally they attach to the ascending processes of the maxilla upper jaw above and to the back posterosuperiorly the bony nasal septum is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone the vomer bone lies below and to the back posteroinferiorly and partially forms the choanal opening into the nasopharynx the upper portion of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages the floor of the nose comprises the premaxilla bone and the palatine bone the roof of the mouth the nasal septum is composed of the quadrangular cartilage the vomer bone the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone aspects of the premaxilla and the palatine bones each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of turbinates nasal conchae which are small thin shellform bones i the superior concha ii the middle concha and iii the inferior concha which are the bony framework of the turbinates lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus inferior to the nasal conchae turbinates is the meatus space with names that correspond to the turbinates eg superior turbinate superior meatus et alii the internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal perforated cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve cranial nerve i finally below and behind posteroinferior the cribriform plate sloping down at an angle is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus the cartilaginous septum septum nasi extends from the nasal bones in the midline above to the bony septum in the midline posteriorly then down along the bony floor the septum is quadrangular the upper half is flanked by two 2 triangulartotrapezoidal cartilages the upper lateralcartilages which are fused to the dorsal septum in the midline and laterally attached with loose ligaments to the bony margin of the pyriform pearshaped aperture while the inferior ends of the upper lateralcartilages are free unattached the internal area angle formed by the septum and upper lateralcartilage constitutes the internal valve of the nose the sesamoid cartilages are adjacent to the upper lateralcartilages in the fibroareolar connective tissue beneath the upper lateralcartilages lay the lower lateralcartilages the paired lower lateralcartilages swing outwards from medial attachments to the caudal septum in the midline the medial crura to an intermediate crus shank area finally the lower lateralcartilages flare outwards above and to the side superolaterally as the lateral crura these cartilages are mobile unlike the upper lateral cartilages furthermore some persons present anatomical evidence of nasal scrolling  ie an outward curving of the lower borders of the upper lateralcartilages and an inward curving of the cephalic borders of the alar cartilages to plan map and execute the surgical correction of a nasal defect or deformity the structure of the external nose is divided into nine 9 aesthetic nasal subunits and six 6 aesthetic nasal segments which provide the plastic surgeon with the measures for determining the size extent and topographic locale of the nasal defect or deformity in turn the nine 9 aesthetic nasal subunits are configured as six 6 aesthetic nasal segments each segment comprehends a nasal area greater than that comprehended by a nasal subunit using the coordinates of the subunits and segments to determine the topographic location of the defect on the nose the plastic surgeon plans maps and executes a rhinoplasty procedure the unitary division of the nasal topography permits minimal but precise cutting and maximal correctivetissue coverage to produce a functional nose of proportionate size contour and appearance for the patient hence if more than 50 per cent of an aesthetic subunit is lost damaged defective destroyed the surgeon replaces the entire aesthetic segment usually with a regional tissue graft harvested from either the face or the head or with a tissue graft harvested from elsewhere on the patients body  like the face the human nose is well vascularized with arteries and veins and thus supplied with abundant blood the principal arterial bloodvessel supply to the nose is twofold i branches from the internal carotid artery the branch of the anterior ethmoid artery the branch of the posterior ethmoid artery which derive from the ophthalmic artery ii branches from the external carotid artery the sphenopalatine artery the greater palatine artery the superior labial artery and the angular artery the external nose is supplied with blood by the facial artery which becomes the angular artery that courses over the superomedial aspect of the nose the sellar region sella turcica turkish chair and the dorsal region of the nose are supplied with blood by branches of the internal maxillary artery infraorbital and the ophthalmic arteries that derive from the internal common carotid artery system internally the lateral nasal wall is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery from behind and below and by the anterior ethmoid artery and the posterior ethmoid artery from above and behind the nasal septum also is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery and by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries with the additional circulatory contributions of the superior labial artery and of the greater palatine artery these three 3 vascular supplies to the internal nose converge in the kiesselbach plexus the little area which is a region in the anteroinferiorthird of the nasal septum in front and below furthermore the nasal vein vascularisation of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal vascularisation the nasal veins are biologically significant because they have no vesselvalves and because of their direct circulatory communication to the sinus caverns which makes possible the potential intracranial spreading of a bacterial infection of the nose hence because of such an abundant nasal blood supply tobacco smoking does therapeutically compromise postoperative healing the pertinent nasal lymphatic system arises from the superficial mucosa and drains posteriorly to the retropharyngeal nodes in back and anteriorly in front either to the upper deep cervical nodes in the neck or to the submandibular glands in the lower jaw or into both the nodes and the glands of the neck and the jaw the sensations registered by the human nose derive from the first two 2 branches of cranial nerve v the trigeminal nerve nervus trigeminis the nerve listings indicate the respective innervation sensory distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches within the nose the face and the upper jaw maxilla the supply of parasympathetic nerves to the face and the upper jaw maxilla derives from the greater superficial petrosal gsp branch of cranial nerve vii the facial nerve the gsp nerve joins the deep petrosal nerve of the sympathetic nervous system derived from the carotid plexus to form the vidian nerve in the vidian canal that traverses the pterygopalatine ganglion an autonomic ganglion of the maxillary nerve wherein only the parasympathetic nerves form synapses which serve the lacrimal gland and the glands of the nose and of the palate via the upper jaw maxillary division of cranial nerve v the trigeminal nerve the form of the nasal subunits  the dorsum the sidewalls the lobule the soft triangles the alae and the columella  are configured differently according to the race and the ethnic group of the patient thus the nasal physiognomies denominated as african platyrrhine flat wide nose asiatic subplatyrrhine low wide nose caucasian leptorrhine narrow nose and hispanic paraleptorrhine narrowsided nose the respective external valve of each nose is variably dependent upon the size shape and strength of the lower lateral cartilage  in the midline of the nose the septum is a composite osseocartilaginous structure that divides the nose into two 2 similar halves the lateral nasal wall and the paranasal sinuses the superior concha the middle concha and the inferior concha form the corresponding passages the superior meatus the middle meatus and the inferior meatus on the lateral nasal wall the superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid bone cells and the sphenoid sinus the middle meatus provides drainage for the anterior ethmoid sinuses and for the maxillary and frontal sinuses and the inferior meatus provides drainage for the nasolacrimal duct the internal nasal valve comprises the area bounded by the upper lateralcartilage the septum the nasal floor and the anterior head of the inferior turbinate in the narrow leptorrhine nose this is the narrowest portion of the nasal airway generally this area requires an angle greater than 15 degrees for unobstructed breathing for the correction of such narrowness the width of the nasal valve can be increased with spreader grafts and flaring sutures at four 4 weeks of gestational development the neural crest cells the precursors of the nose begin their caudad migration from the posterior towards the midface two symmetrical nasal placodes the future olfactory epithelium develop inferiorly which the nasal pits then divide into the medial and the lateral nasal processes the future upper lip and nose the medial processes then form the septum the philtrum and the premaxilla of the nose the lateral processes form the sides of the nose and the mouth forms from the stomodeum the anterior ectodermal portion of the alimentary tract which is inferior to the nasal complex a nasobuccal membrane separates the mouth from the nose respectively the inferior oral cavity the mouth and the superior nasal cavity the nose as the olfactory pits deepen said development forms the choanae the two openings that connect the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx upper part of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages initially primitiveform choanae develop which then further develop into the secondary permanent choanae at ten 10 weeks of gestation the cells differentiate into muscle cartilage and bone if this important early facial embryogenesis fails it might result in anomalies such as choanal atresia absent or closed passage medial nasal clefts fissures or lateral nasal clefts nasal aplasia faulty or incomplete development and polyrrhinia double nose  this normal human embryologic development is exceptionally important because the newborn infant breathes through his or her nose during the first 6 weeks of life thus when a child is afflicted with bilateral choanal atresia the blockage of the posterior nasal passage either by abnormal bony tissue or by abnormal soft tissue emergency remedial action is required to ensure that the child can breathe

V the visual system is the part of the central nervous system which gives organisms the ability to process visual detail as well as enabling the formation of several nonimage photo response functions it detects and interprets information from visible light to build a representation of the surrounding environment the visual system carries out a number of complex tasks including the reception of light and the formation of monocular representations the buildup of a nuclear binocular perception from a pair of two dimensional projections the identification and categorization of visual objects assessing distances to and between objects and guiding body movements in relation to the objects seen the psychological process of visual information is known as visual perception a lack of which is called blindness nonimage forming visual functions independent of visual perception include the pupillary light reflex plr and circadian photoentrainment   this article mostly describes the visual system of mammals humans in particular although other higher animals have similar visual systems see bird vision vision in fish mollusc eye reptile vision in the case of mammals including humans the visual system consists of these are divided into anterior and posterior pathways the anterior visual pathway refers to structures involved in vision before the lateral geniculate nucleus the posterior visual pathway refers to structures after this point light entering the eye is refracted as it passes through the cornea it then passes through the pupil controlled by the iris and is further refracted by the lens the cornea and lens act together as a compound lens to project an inverted image onto the retina the retina consists of a large number of photoreceptor cells which contain particular protein molecules called opsins in humans two types of opsins are involved in conscious vision rod opsins and cone opsins a third type melanopsin in some of the retinal ganglion cells rgc part of the body clock mechanism is probably not involved in conscious vision as these rgc do not project to the lateral geniculate nucleus but to the pretectal olivary nucleus  an opsin absorbs a photon a particle of light and transmits a signal to the cell through a signal transduction pathway resulting in hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor rods and cones differ in function rods are found primarily in the periphery of the retina and are used to see at low levels of light cones are found primarily in the center or fovea of the retina  there are three types of cones that differ in the wavelengths of light they absorb they are usually called short or blue middle or green and long or red cones are used primarily to distinguish color and other features of the visual world at normal levels of light  in the retina the photoreceptors synapse directly onto bipolar cells which in turn synapse onto ganglion cells of the outermost layer which will then conduct action potentials to the brain a significant amount of visual processing arises from the patterns of communication between neurons in the retina about 130 million photoreceptors absorb light yet roughly 12 million axons of ganglion cells transmit information from the retina to the brain the processing in the retina includes the formation of centersurround receptive fields of bipolar and ganglion cells in the retina as well as convergence and divergence from photoreceptor to bipolar cell in addition other neurons in the retina particularly horizontal and amacrine cells transmit information laterally from a neuron in one layer to an adjacent neuron in the same layer resulting in more complex receptive fields that can be either indifferent to color and sensitive to motion or sensitive to color and indifferent to motion  mechanism of generating visual signals the retina adapts to change in light through the use of the rods in the dark the chromophobe retinal has a bent shape called cisretinal when light is present the retinal changes to a straight form called transretinal and breaks away from the opsin this is called bleaching because the purified rhodopsin changes from violet to colorless in the light at baseline in the dark the rhodopsin absorbs no light and releases glutamate which inhibits the bipolar cell this inhibits the release of neurotransmitters from the bipolar cells to the ganglion cell when there is light present glutamate secretion ceases thus no longer inhibiting the bipolar cell from releasing neurotransmitters to the ganglion cell and therefore an image can be detected   the final result of all this processing is five different populations of ganglion cells that send visual imageforming and nonimageforming information to the brain a 2006 university of pennsylvania study calculated the approximate bandwidth of human retinas to be about 8960 kilobits per second whereas guinea pig retinas transfer at about 875 kilobits  in 2007 zaidi and coresearchers on both sides of the atlantic studying patients without rods and cones discovered that the novel photoreceptive ganglion cell in humans also has a role in conscious and unconscious visual perception  the peak spectral sensitivity was 481nm this shows that there are two pathways for sight in the retina  one based on classic photoreceptors rods and cones and the other newly discovered based on photoreceptive ganglion cells which act as rudimentary visual brightness detectors the functioning of a camera is often compared with the workings of the eye mostly since both focus light from external objects in the field of view onto a lightsensitive medium in the case of the camera this medium is film or an electronic sensor in the case of the eye it is an array of visual receptors with this simple geometrical similarity based on the laws of optics the eye functions as a transducer as does a ccd camera in the visual system retinal technically called retinene1 or retinaldehyde is a lightsensitive molecule found in the rods and cones of the retina retinal is the fundamental structure involved in the transduction of light into visual signals ie nerve impulses in the ocular system of the central nervous system in the presence of light the retinal molecule changes configuration and as a result a nerve impulse is generated  the information about the image via the eye is transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve different populations of ganglion cells in the retina send information to the brain through the optic nerve about 90 of the axons in the optic nerve go to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus these axons originate from the m p and k ganglion cells in the retina see above this parallel processing is important for reconstructing the visual world each type of information will go through a different route to perception another population sends information to the superior colliculus in the midbrain which assists in controlling eye movements saccades  as well as other motor responses a final population of photosensitive ganglion cells containing melanopsin sends information via the retinohypothalamic tract rht to the pretectum pupillary reflex to several structures involved in the control of circadian rhythms and sleep such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn the biological clock and to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus vlpo a region involved in sleep regulation  a recently discovered role for photoreceptive ganglion cells is that they mediate conscious and unconscious vision  acting as rudimentary visual brightness detectors as shown in rodless coneless eyes  the optic nerves from both eyes meet and cross at the optic chiasm   at the base of the hypothalamus of the brain at this point the information coming from both eyes is combined and then splits according to the visual field the corresponding halves of the field of view right and left are sent to the left and right halves of the brain respectively to be processed that is the right side of primary visual cortex deals with the left half of the field of view from both eyes and similarly for the left brain  a small region in the center of the field of view is processed redundantly by both halves of the brain information from the right visual field now on the left side of the brain travels in the left optic tract information from the left visual field travels in the right optic tract each optic tract terminates in the lateral geniculate nucleus lgn in the thalamus the lateral geniculate nucleus lgn is a sensory relay nucleus in the thalamus of the brain the lgn consists of six layers in humans and other primates starting from catarhinians including cercopithecidae and apes layers 1 4 and 6 correspond to information from the contralateral crossed fibers of the nasal retina temporal visual field layers 2 3 and 5 correspond to information from the ipsilateral uncrossed fibers of the temporal retina nasal visual field layer one 1 contains m cells which correspond to the m magnocellular cells of the optic nerve of the opposite eye and are concerned with depth or motion layers four and six 4  6 of the lgn also connect to the opposite eye but to the p cells color and edges of the optic nerve by contrast layers two three and five 2 3  5 of the lgn connect to the m cells and p parvocellular cells of the optic nerve for the same side of the brain as its respective lgn spread out the six layers of the lgn are the area of a credit card and about three times its thickness the lgn is rolled up into two ellipsoids about the size and shape of two small birds eggs in between the six layers are smaller cells that receive information from the k cells color in the retina the neurons of the lgn then relay the visual image to the primary visual cortex v1 which is located at the back of the brain posterior end in the occipital lobe in and close to the calcarine sulcus the lgn is not just a simple relay station but it is also a center for processing it receives reciprocal input from the cortical and subcortical layers and reciprocal innervation from the visual cortex  the optic radiations one on each side of the brain carry information from the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus to layer 4 of the visual cortex the p layer neurons of the lgn relay to v1 layer 4c \u03b2 the m layer neurons relay to v1 layer 4c \u03b1 the k layer neurons in the lgn relay to large neurons called blobs in layers 2 and 3 of v1  there is a direct correspondence from an angular position in the field of view of the eye all the way through the optic tract to a nerve position in v1 at this juncture in v1 the image path ceases to be straightforward there is more crossconnection within the visual cortex the visual cortex is the largest system in the human brain and is responsible for processing the visual image it lies at the rear of the brain highlighted in the image above the cerebellum the region that receives information directly from the lgn is called the primary visual cortex also called v1 and striate cortex visual information then flows through a cortical hierarchy these areas include v2 v3 v4 and area v5mt the exact connectivity depends on the species of the animal these secondary visual areas collectively termed the extrastriate visual cortex process a wide variety of visual primitives neurons in v1 and v2 respond selectively to bars of specific orientations or combinations of bars these are believed to support edge and corner detection similarly basic information about color and motion is processed here  heider et al 2002 have found that neurons involving v1 v2 and v3 can detect stereoscopic illusory contours they found that stereoscopic stimuli subtending up to 8 can activate these neurons  as visual information passes forward through the visual hierarchy the complexity of the neural representations increases whereas a v1 neuron may respond selectively to a line segment of a particular orientation in a particular retinotopic location neurons in the lateral occipital complex respond selectively to complete object eg a figure drawing and neurons in visual association cortex may respond selectively to human faces or to a particular object along with this increasing complexity of neural representation may come a level of specialization of processing into two distinct pathways the dorsal stream and the ventral stream the two streams hypothesis  first proposed by ungerleider and mishkin in 1982 the dorsal stream commonly referred to as the where stream is involved in spatial attention covert and overt and communicates with regions that control eye movements and hand movements more recently this area has been called the how stream to emphasize its role in guiding behaviors to spatial locations the ventral stream commonly referred as the what stream is involved in the recognition identification and categorization of visual stimuli however there is still much debate about the degree of specialization within these two pathways since they are in fact heavily interconnected  horace barlow proposed the efficient coding hypothesis in 1961 as a theoretical model of sensory coding in the brain  the default mode network is a network of brain regions that are active when an individual is awake and at rest the visual systems default mode can be monitored during resting state fmri fox et al 2005 have found that the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic anticorrelated functional networks  in which the visual system switches from resting state to attention in the parietal lobe the lateral and ventral intraparietal cortex are involved in visual attention and saccadic eye movements these regions are in the intraparietal sulcus marked in red in the image to the right newborn infants have limited color perception  one study found that 74 of newborns can distinguish red 36 green 25 yellow and 14 blue after one month performance improved somewhat  infants eyes dont have the ability to accommodate the pediatricians are able to perform nonverbal testing to assess visual acuity of a newborn detect nearsightedness and astigmatism and evaluate the eye teaming and alignment visual acuity improves from about 20400 at birth to approximately 2025 at 6 months of age all this is happening because the nerve cells in their retina and brain that control vision are not fully developed depth perception focus tracking and other aspects of vision continue to develop throughout early and middle childhood from recent studies in the united states and australia there is some evidence that the amount of time school aged children spend outdoors in natural light may have some impact on whether they develop myopia the condition tends to get somewhat worse through childhood and adolescence but stabilizes in adulthood more prominent myopia nearsightedness and astigmatism are thought to be inherited children with this condition may have to wear glasses eyesight is often one of the first senses affected by aging a number of changes occur with aging along with proprioception and vestibular function the visual system plays an important role in the ability of an individual to control balance and maintain an upright posture when these three conditions are isolated and balance is tested it has been found that vision is the most significant contributor to balance playing a bigger role than either of the two other intrinsic mechanisms  the clarity with which an individual can see his environment as well as the size of the visual field the susceptibility of the individual to light and glare and poor depth perception play important roles in providing a feedback loop to the brain on the bodys movement through the environment anything that affects any of these variables can have a negative effect on balance and maintaining posture  this effect has been seen in research involving elderly subjects when compared to young controls  in glaucoma patients compared to age matched controls  cataract patients pre and post surgery  and even something as simple as wearing safety goggles  monocular vision one eyed vision has also been shown to negatively impact balance which was seen in the previously referenced cataract and glaucoma studies   as well as in healthy children and adults  according to pollock et al 2010 stroke is the main cause of specific visual impairment most frequently visual field loss homonymous hemianopia a visual field defect nevertheless evidence for the efficacy of costeffective interventions aimed at these visual field defects is still inconsistent  this is clouding of the lens although it may be accompanied by yellowing clouding and yellowing can occur separately the lens becomes inflexible known as decrease in accommodation tending to remain fixed at longdistance focus this is a kind of blindness that begins at the edge of the field of vision and progresses inward it may result in tunnel vision glaucoma typically involves the outer layers of the optic nerve sometimes as a result of buildup of fluid and excessive pressure in the eye  different species are able to see different parts of the light spectrum for example bees can see into the ultraviolet  while pit vipers can accurately target prey with their pit organs which are sensitive to infrared radiation  the eye of a swordfish can generate heat to better cope with detecting their prey at depths of 2000 feet  certain onecelled microorganisms the warnowiid dinoflagellates have eyelike ocelloids with analogous structures for the lens and retina of the multicellular eye  the armored shell of the chiton acanthopleura granulata is also covered with hundreds of aragonite crystalline eyes denoted ocelli which are capable of forming images  in the second half of the 19th century many motifs of the nervous system were identified such as the neuron doctrine and brain localization which related to the neuron being the basic unit of the nervous system and functional localisation in the brain respectively these would become tenets of the fledgling neuroscience and would support further understanding of the visual system the notion that the cerebral cortex is divided into functionally distinct cortices now known to be responsible for capacities such as touch somatosensory cortex movement motor cortex and vision visual cortex was first proposed by franz joseph gall in 1810  evidence for functionally distinct areas of the brain and specifically of the cerebral cortex mounted throughout the 19th century with discoveries by paul broca of the language center 1861 and gustav fritsch and edouard hitzig of the motor cortex 1871   based on selective damage to parts of the brain and the functional effects this would produce lesion studies david ferrier proposed that visual function was localized to the parietal lobe of the brain in 1876  in 1881 hermann munk more accurately located vision in the occipital lobe where the primary visual cortex is now known to be

V a sex organ or primary sexual characteristic as narrowly defined is any anatomical part of the body involved in sexual reproduction and constituting the reproductive system in a complex organism especially the external sex organs the external sex organs are also commonly referred to as the genitalia or genitals   mosses ferns and some similar plants have gametangia for reproductive organs which are part of the gametophyte  the flowers of flowering plants produce pollen and egg cells but the sex organs themselves are inside the gametophytes within the pollen and the ovule  coniferous plants likewise produce their sexually reproductive structures within the gametophytes contained within the cones and pollen the cones and pollen are not themselves sexual organs   the latin term genitalia sometimes anglicized as genitals is used to describe the externally visible sex organs known as primary genitalia or external genitalia in male mammals the penis and scrotum and in female mammals the clitoris and vulva the other hidden sex organs are referred to as the secondary genitalia or internal genitalia the most important of these are the gonads a pair of sex organs specifically the testes in the male or the ovaries in the female gonads are the true sex organs generating reproductive gametes containing inheritable dna they also produce most of the primary hormones that affect sexual development and regulate other sexual organs and sexually differentiated behaviors in general zoology given the great variety in organs physiologies and behaviors involved in copulation male genitalia are more strictly defined as all male structures that are inserted in the female or that hold her near her gonopore during sperm transfer female genitalia are defined as those parts of the female reproductive tract that make direct contact with male genitalia or male products sperm spermatophores during or immediately after copulation   the visible portion of the mammalian genitals for males consists of the scrotum and penis for females it consists of the labia clitoris and vagina in placental mammals females have two genital orifices the vagina and urethra while males have only one the urethra  male and female genitals have many nerve endings resulting in pleasurable and highly sensitive touch   in most human societies particularly in conservative ones genitals are considered a public indecency and sometimes even illegal if left uncovered in public  in mammals sex organs include in typical prenatal development sexual organs originate from a common anlage anatomy during early gestation and differentiate into male or female variations the sry gene usually located on the y chromosome and encoding the testis determining factor determines the direction of this differentiation the absence of it allows the gonads to continue to develop into ovaries thereafter the development of the internal reproductive organs and the external genitalia is determined by hormones produced by certain fetal gonads ovaries or testes and the cells response to them the initial appearance of the fetal genitalia a few weeks after conception looks basically feminine a pair of urogenital folds with a small protuberance in the middle and the urethra behind the protuberance if the fetus has testes and if the testes produce testosterone and if the cells of the genitals respond to the testosterone the outer urogenital folds swell and fuse in the midline to produce the scrotum the protuberance grows larger and straighter to form the penis the inner urogenital swellings grow wrap around the penis and fuse in the midline to form the penile urethra each sexual organ in one sex has a homologous counterpart in the other one see a list of homologues of the human reproductive system in a larger perspective the whole process of sexual differentiation also includes development of secondary sexual characteristics such as patterns of pubic and facial hair and female breasts that emerge at puberty furthermore differences in brain structure arise affecting but not absolutely determining behavior intersex is the development of genitalia somewhere between typical male and female genitalia once the child is born the parents are faced with decisions that are often difficult to make such as whether or not to modify the genitalia assign the child as male or female or leave the genitalia as is some parents allow their doctors to choose if they do decide to modify the genitalia they have approximately a 50 chance of getting genitalia that will match the childs gender identity if they pick the wrong one their child may begin to show symptoms of transsexualism which can lead them to a life of discomfort until they are able to remedy the issue  because of the strong sexual selection affecting the structure and function of genitalia they form an organ system that evolves faster that any other  a great variety of genital form and function may therefore be found among animals the life cycle of land plants involves alternation of generations between a sporophyte and a haploid gametophyte the gametophyte produces sperm andor egg cells by mitosis the sporophyte produces spores by meiosis which in turn develop into gametophytes any sex organs that are produced by the plant will develop on the gametophyte the seed plants which include conifers and flowering plants have small gametophytes that develop inside the pollen grains male and the ovule female sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the union of the male and female germ cells sperm and egg cells respectively pollen is produced in stamens and is carried to the pistil which has the ovary at its base where fertilization can take place within each pollen grain is a male gametophyte which consists of only three cells in most flowering plants the female gametophyte within the ovule consists of only seven cells thus there are no sex organs as such

V understanding how the brain works is arguably one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time the white house brain initiative brain research through advancing innovative neurotechnologies is a collaborative publicprivate research initiative announced by the obama administration on april 2 2013 with the goal of supporting the development and application of innovative technologies that can create a dynamic understanding of brain function      this activity is a grand challenge focused on revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain and was developed by the white house office of science and technology policy ostp as part of a broader white house neuroscience initiative  inspired by the human genome project brain aims to help researchers uncover the mysteries of brain disorders such as alzheimers and parkinsons diseases depression and traumatic brain injury tbi   the brain initiative reflects a number of influences stemming back over a decade some of these include planning meetings at the national institutes of health that led to the nihs blueprint for neuroscience research  workshops at the national science foundation nsf on cognition neuroscience and convergent science including a 2006 report on grand challenges of mind and brain  reports from the national research council and the institute of medicines forum on neuroscience and nervous system disorders including from molecules to mind challenges for the 21st century a report of a june 25 2008 workshop on grand challenges in neuroscience  years of research and reports from scientists and professional societies and congressional interest one important activity was the brain activity map project in september 2011 molecular biologist miyoung chun of the kavli foundation organized a conference in london at which scientists first put forth the idea of such a project   at subsequent meetings scientists from us government laboratories including members of the office of science and technology policy and from the howard hughes medical institute and the allen institute for brain science along with representatives from google microsoft and qualcomm discussed possibilities for a future governmentled project  other influences included the interdisciplinary decade of the mind project led by james l olds who is currently the assistant director for biological sciences at nsf   and the revolutionizing prosthetics project at darpa led by dr geoffrey ling and shown on 60 minutes in april 2009  development of the plan for the brain initiative within the executive office of the president eop was led by ostp and included the following eop staff philip rubin then principal assistant director for science and leader of the white house neuroscience initiative thomas kalil deputy director for technology and innovation cristin dorgelo then assistant director for grand challenges and currently chief of staff at ostp and carlos peña assistant director for emerging technologies and currently the division director for the division of neurological and physical medicine devices in the office of device evaluation center for devices and radiological health cdrh at the us food and drug administration fda   on april 2 2013 at a white house event president barack obama announced the brain initiative with proposed initial expenditures for fiscal year 2014 of approximately 110 million from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the national institutes of health nih and the national science foundation nsf    the president also directed the presidential commission for the study of bioethical issues to explore the ethical legal and societal implications raised by the initiative and by neuroscience in general additional commitments were also made by the allen institute for brain science the howard hughes medical institute and the kavli foundation the nih also announced the creation of a working group of the advisory committee to the director led by neuroscientists cornelia bargmann and william newsome and with ex officio participation from darpa and nsf to help shape nihs role in the brain initiative nsf planned to receive advice from its directorate advisory committees from the national science board and from a series of meetings bringing together scientists in neuroscience and related areas    news reports said the research would map the dynamics of neuron activity in mice and other animals  and eventually the tens of billions of neurons in the human brain  in a 2012 scientific commentary outlining experimental plans for a more limited project alivisatos et al outlined a variety of specific experimental techniques that might be used to achieve what they termed a functional connectome as well as new technologies that will have to be developed in the course of the project  they indicated that initial studies might be done in caenorhabditis elegans followed by drosophila because of their comparatively simple neural circuits midterm studies could be done in zebrafish mice and the etruscan shrew with studies ultimately to be done in primates and humans they proposed the development of nanoparticles that could be used as voltage sensors that would detect individual action potentials as well as nanoprobes that could serve as electrophysiological multielectrode arrays in particular they called for the use of wireless noninvasive methods of neuronal activity detection either utilizing microelectronic verylargescale integration or based on synthetic biology rather than microelectronics in one such proposed method enzymatically produced dna would serve as a ticker tape record of neuronal activity   based on calcium ioninduced errors in coding by dna polymerase  data would be analyzed and modeled by large scale computation  a related technique proposed the use of highthroughput dna sequencing for rapidly mapping neural connectivity  the advisory committee is  scientists offered differing views of the plan neuroscientist john donoghue said that the project would fill a gap in neuroscience research between on the one hand activity measurements at the level of brain regions using methods such as fmri and on the other hand measurements at the level of single cells  psychologist ed vul expressed concern however that the initiative would divert funding from individual investigator studies  neuroscientist donald stein expressed concern that it would be a mistake to begin by spending money on technological methods before knowing exactly what would be measured  physicist michael roukes argued instead that methods in nanotechnology are becoming sufficiently mature to make the time right for a brain activity map  the projects face great logistical challenges neuroscientists estimated that the project would generate 300 exabytes of data every year presenting a significant technical barrier  most of the available highresolution brain activity monitors are of limited use as they must be invasively implanted surgically by opening the skull  parallels have been drawn to past largescale governmentled research efforts including the map of the human genome the voyage to the moon and the development of the atomic bomb

V in anatomy the gastroduodenal artery is a small blood vessel in the abdomen it supplies blood directly to the pylorus distal part of the stomach and proximal part of the duodenum and indirectly to the pancreatic head via the anterior and posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries the gastroduodenal artery most commonly arises from the common hepatic artery of the celiac trunk but there are numerous variations of the origin  it first gives rise to the supraduodenal artery followed by the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery it terminates in a bifurcation when it splits into the right gastroepiploic artery and the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery superior pancreaticoduodenal artery these branches form functional anastomoses with the anterior and posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries from the superior mesenteric artery note that the exact branching of vessels from the gastroduoenal artery is variable typically the posterior and anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries branch independently in that order but can rarely come of a common trunk   the gastroduodenal artery can be the source of a significant gastrointestinal bleed which may arise as a complication of peptic ulcer disease because of its close relationship to the posteromedial wall of the second part of the duodenum deeply penetrating ulcers or tumours of the duodenum may cause torrential bleeding from the gastroduodenal artery of haemorrhage not least because of the profuse arterial network in the region ensures a high flow rate in the vessel  gastroduodenal artery

V lactation describes the secretion of milk from the mammary glands and the period of time that a mother lactates to feed her young the process can occur with almost all postpregnancy female mammals although it predates mammals  in humans the process of feeding milk is also called breastfeeding or nursing in most species milk comes out of the mothers nipples however the platypus a nonplacental mammal releases milk through ducts in its abdomen in only one species of mammal the dayak fruit bat is milk production a normal male function galactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production this stage requires prolactin oxytocin is critical for the milk letdown reflex in response to suckling newborn infants often produce some witchs milk galactorrhea is milk production unrelated to nursing it can occur in males and females of many mammal species as result of hormonal imbalances or unusual physiological stimuli   the chief function of lactation is to provide nutrition and immune protection to the young after birth in almost all mammals lactation induces a period of infertility which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring  from the twentyfourth week of pregnancy the second and third trimesters a womans body produces hormones that stimulate the growth of the milk duct system in the breasts by the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy the breasts are ready to produce milk it is also possible to induce lactation without pregnancy during the latter part of pregnancy the womans breasts enter into the secretory differentiation stage this is when the breasts make colostrum see below a thick sometimes yellowish fluid at this stage high levels of progesterone inhibit most milk production it is not a medical concern if a pregnant woman leaks any colostrum before her babys birth nor is it an indication of future milk production at birth prolactin levels remain high while the delivery of the placenta results in a sudden drop in progesterone estrogen and hpl levels this abrupt withdrawal of progesterone in the presence of high prolactin levels stimulates the copious milk production of secretory activation when the breast is stimulated prolactin levels in the blood rise peak in about 45 minutes and return to the prebreastfeeding state about three hours later the release of prolactin triggers the cells in the alveoli to make milk prolactin also transfers to the breast milk some research indicates that prolactin in milk is greater at times of higher milk production and lower when breasts are fuller and that the highest levels tend to occur between 2 am and 6 am  other hormonesnotably insulin thyroxine and cortisolare also involved but their roles are not yet well understood although biochemical markers indicate that secretory activation begins about 3040 hours after birth mothers do not typically begin feeling increased breast fullness the sensation of milk coming in the breast until 5073 hours 23 days after birth colostrum is the first milk a breastfed baby receives it contains higher amounts of white blood cells and antibodies than mature milk and is especially high in immunoglobulin a iga which coats the lining of the babys immature intestines and helps to prevent pathogens from invading the babys system secretory iga also helps prevent food allergies  over the first two weeks after the birth colostrum production slowly gives way to mature breast milk  the hormonal endocrine control system drives milk production during pregnancy and the first few days after the birth when the milk supply is more firmly established autocrine or local control system begins during this stage the more that milk is removed from the breasts the more the breast will produce milk   research also suggests that draining the breasts more fully also increases the rate of milk production  thus the milk supply is strongly influenced by how often the baby feeds and how well it is able to transfer milk from the breast low supply can often be traced to this is the mechanism by which milk is transported from the breast alveoli to the nipple suckling by the baby stimulates the paraventricular nuclei and supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus which signals to the posterior pituitary gland to produce oxytocin oxytocin stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli which already hold milk the increased pressure causes milk to flow through the duct system and be released through the nipple this response can be conditioned eg to the cry of the baby milk ejection is initiated in the mothers breast by the act of suckling by the baby the milk ejection reflex also called letdown reflex is not always consistent especially at first once a woman is conditioned to nursing letdown can be triggered by a variety of stimuli including the sound of any baby even thinking about breastfeeding can stimulate this reflex causing unwanted leakage or both breasts may give out milk when an infant is feeding from one breast however this and other problems often settle after two weeks of feeding stress or anxiety can cause difficulties with breastfeeding the release of the hormone oxytocin leads to the milk ejection or letdown reflex oxytocin stimulates the muscles surrounding the breast to squeeze out the milk breastfeeding mothers describe the sensation differently some feel a slight tingling others feel immense amounts of pressure or slight paindiscomfort and still others do not feel anything different a poor milk ejection reflex can be due to sore or cracked nipples separation from the infant a history of breast surgery or tissue damage from prior breast trauma if a mother has trouble breastfeeding different methods of assisting the milk ejection reflex may help these include feeding in a familiar and comfortable location massage of the breast or back or warming the breast with a cloth or shower a surge of oxytocin also causes the uterus to contract during breastfeeding mothers may feel these contractions as afterpains these may range from periodlike cramps to strong labourlike contractions and can be more severe with second and subsequent babies    in humans induced lactation and relactation have been observed frequently in some cultures and demonstrated with varying success in adoptive mothers it appears plausible that the possibility of lactation in women or females of other species who are not biological mothers does confer an evolutionary advantage especially in groups with high maternal mortality and tight social bonds   the phenomenon has been also observed in most primates in some lemurs and in dwarf mongooses   lactation can be induced in humans by a combination of physical and psychological stimulation by drugs or by a combination of those methods  some couples may stimulate lactation outside of pregnancy for sexual purposes rare accounts of male lactation as distinct from galactorrhea exist in historical medical and anthropological literature although the phenomenon has not been confirmed by more recent literature  charles darwin recognized that mammary glands seemed to have developed specifically from cutaneous glands and hypothesized that they evolved from glands in brood pouches of fish where they would provide nourishment for eggs  the latter aspect of his hypothesis has not been confirmed however more recently the same mechanism has been postulated for early synapsids  the discus fish symphysodon aequifasciata is known for biparentally feeding their offspring by epidermal mucus secretion  a closer examination reveals that as in mammals the secretion of the discus fishs nourishing fluid may be controlled by prolactin  o t oftedal has argued that later therapsids such as cynodonts secreted complex nutrientrich milk this brought them evolutionary advantage by allowing a decline in egg size  however sinocodon a small early mammal or mammaliomorphan appears to have had teeth from the very earliest age and a poorly ossified jaw as juvenile and probably did not suckle  this may indicate the therapsids used their milk for moistening their eggs only during early evolution of lactation the secretion was through pilosebaceous glands and mammary hairs transported the nourishing fluids to the eggs or young later the development of the mammary patch rendered mammary hairs obsolete  another well known example of nourishing young with secretions of glands is the crop milk of pigeons like in mammals and disc fish this also appears closely regulated by prolactin  other birds such as flamingos and penguins utilize similar feeding techniques  lactation is also the hallmark of adenotrophic viviparity  a breeding mechanism developed by some insects most notably tsetse flies the single egg of the tsetse develops into a larva inside the uterus where it is fed by a milky substance secreted by a milk gland inside the uterus  the cockroach species diploptera punctata is also known to feed their offspring by milky secretions

V interactive specialization is a theory of brain development proposed by the british cognitive neuroscientist mark johnson who is head of the centre for brain and cognitive development  at birkbeck university of london london in his book developmental cognitive neuroscience   johnson contrasts two views of development according to the first the maturational hypothesis the relationship between structure and function ie which parts of the brain perform a particular task is static and specific cognitive skills come online as the cortical circuitry intrinsic to a particular task matures johnson likens this to a mosaic view of development according to the second the interactive specialization is     hypothesis development is not a unidirectional maturational process but rather a set of complex dynamic and backpropagated interactions between genetics brain body and environment development is not a simple question of a brain being built according to a prespecified genetic blueprint  rather the components of the brain are interacting with each other constantly  even prenatally when patterns of spontaneous firing of cells in the eyes before they have opened transmit signals that appear to help develop the layered structure of the lateral geniculate nucleus   the hypothesis has attracted increasing attention in recent years as a number of neuroimaging studies on younger children have provided data that appears to fit specific predictions made by johnsons model     in 1996 johnson coauthored with jeffrey elman annette karmiloffsmith elizabeth bates domenico parisi and kim plunkett the book rethinking innateness    which argues against a strong nativist innate view on development other key influences include gilbert gottliebs theory of probabilistic epigenesis   a framework that emphasizes the reciprocity and ubiquity of geneenvironment interaction in the realization of all phenotypes and work on developmental disorders by annette karmiloffsmith

V hepatic insufficiency implies the inability of the liver to carry out its metabolic excretory and detoxifying functions owing to a decrease in the number of functional hepatocytes or because their normal activity is altered hepatic insufficiency can be acute or chronic acute liver failure alf is produced without a previous liver disease whereas the chronic liver failure is the consequence of a liver disease evolution over a long period of time independently of its etiology and degree the incidence of acute liver failure is estimated to be of 16 cases per million of person  alf can be subclassified into hyperacute acute and subacute based on when hepatic encephalopathy occurs following the onset of jaundice ogrady et al 1993  and this classification can sometimes help to identify the etiology potential complications and patient prognosis table 1 in hyperacute and acute liver failure the clinical picture develops rapidly with progressive encephalopathy and multiorgan dysfunction such as hyperdynamic circulation coagulopathy acute renal and respiratory insufficiency severe metabolic alterations and cerebral edema that can lead to brain death   in these cases the mortality without liver transplantation ltx ranges between 4080   ltx is the only effective treatment for these patients although it requires a precise indication and timing to achieve good results nevertheless due to the scarcity of organs to carry out liver transplantations it is estimated that one third of patients with alf die while waiting to be transplanted  on the other hand a patient with a chronic hepatic disease can suffer an acute decompensation of liver function following a precipitating event such as variceal bleeding sepsis and excessive alcohol intake among others that can lead to a condition referred to as acuteonchronic liver failure aclf both types of hepatic insufficiency alf and aclf can potentially be reversible and liver functionality can return to a level similar to that prior to the insult or precipitating event ltx is the only treatment that has shown an improvement in the prognosis and survival with most severe cases of alf nevertheless cost and donor scarcity have prompted researchers to look for new supportive treatments that can act as bridge to the transplant procedure by stabilizing the patients clinical state or by creating the right conditions that could allow the recovery of native liver functions both detoxification and synthesis can improve after an episode of alf or aclf  basically three different types of supportive therapies have been developed bioartificial artificial and hybrid liver support systems table 2 extracorporeal liver assist device molecular adsorbent recirculating system bioartificial liver support system fractionated plasma separation and adsorption system tecahybrid artificial liver support system radial flow bioreactor singlepass albumin dialysis modular extracorporeal liver support bioartificial liver selective plasma filtration therapy bioartificial liver support systems are experimental extracorporeal devices that use living cell lines to provide detoxification and synthesis support to the failing liver bioartificial liver bal hepatassist 2000 uses porcine hepatocytes  whereas elad system employs hepatocytes derived from human hepatoblastoma c3a cell lines    both techniques can produce in fulminat hepatic failure fhf an improvement of hepatic encephalopathy grade and biochemical parameters nevertheless they are therapies with high complexity that require a complex logistic approach for implementation a very high cost and possible inducement of important side effects such as immunological issues porcine endogenous retrovirus transmission infectious complications and tumor transmigration have been documented other biological hepatic systems are bioartificial liver support blss  and radial flow bioreactor rfb  detoxification capacity of these systems is poor and therefore they must be used combined with other systems to mitigate this deficiency today its use is limited to centers with high experience in their application  artificial liver support systems are aimed to temporally replace native liver detoxification functions and they use albumin as scavenger molecule to clear the toxins involved in the physiopathology of the failing liver most of the toxins that accumulate in the plasma of patients with liver insufficiency are protein bound and therefore conventional renal dialysis techniques such as hemofiltration hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration are not able to adequately eliminate them between the different albumin dialysis modalities single pass albumin dialysis spad has shown some positive results at a very high cost  it has been proposed that lowering the concentration of albumin in the dialysate does not seem to affect the detoxification capability of the procedure  nevertheless the most widely used systems today are based on hemodialysis and adsorption these systems use conventional dialysis methods with an albumin containing dialysate that is latter regenerate by means of adsorption columns filled with activated charcoal and ion exchange resins at present there are two artificial extracorporeal liver support systems the molecular adsorbents recirculating system mars  from gambro and fractionated plasma separation and adsorption fpsa commercialised as prometheus prom from fresenius medical care  of the two therapies mars is the most frequently studied and clinically used system to date   mars was developed by a group of researchers at the university of rostock germany in 1993  and later commercialized for its clinical use in 1999  the system is able to replace the detoxification function of the liver while minimizing the inconvenience and drawbacks of previously used devices    in vivo preliminary investigations indicated the ability of the system to effectively remove bilirubin biliary salts free fatty acids and tryptophan while important physiological proteins such as albumin alpha1glicoproteine alpha 1 antitrypsin alpha2macroglobulin transferrin globulin tyrosine and hormonal systems are unaffected  also mars therapy in conjunction with crrthdf can help clear cytokines acting as inflammatory and immunological mediators in hepatocellular damage and therefore can create the right environment to favour hepatocellular regeneration and recovery of native liver function mars is an extracorporeal hemodialysis system composed of three different circuits blood albumin and lowflux dialysis the blood circuit uses a double lumen catheter and a conventional hemodialysis device to pump the patients blood into the mars flux a biocompatible polysulfone highflux dialyser with a membrane surface area of 21 m  100nm of thickness and a cutoff of 50 kda the marsflux is essential to retaining the albumin in the dialysate blood is dialysed against a human serum albumin hsa dialysate solution that allows blood detoxification of both watersoluble and proteinbound toxins by means of the presence of albumin in the dialysate albumin dialysis the albumin dialysate is then regenerated in a close loop in the mars circuit by passing through the fibres of the lowflux diaflux filter to clear watersoluble toxins and provide electrolyteacidbase balance by a standard dialysis fluid next the albumin dialysate passes through two different adsorption columns proteinbound substances are removed by the diamars ac250 containing activated charcoal and anionic substances are removed by the diamars ie250 filled with cholestyramine an anionexchange resin the albumin solution is then ready to initiate another detoxifying cycle of the patients blood that can be sustained until both adsorption columns are saturated eliminating the need to continuously infuse albumin into the system during treatment fig 1 a systematic review of the literature from 1999 to june 2011 was performed in the following databases the livernet is a database dedicated to the liver diseases treated with the support of extracorporeal therapies to date the most currently used system is the molecular adsorbent recirculating system mars which is based on the selective removal of albumin bound molecules and toxins from the blood in patients with acute and acuteonchronic liver failure the purpose is to register prospectively all patients treated worldwide with the mars system in order to the livernet is an ecrf database wwwlivernetnet using a sas plateform that allows major advantages for the centres including the automatic calculations of most liver rand icu scoring systems instant queries online instant export of all patients included in the database of each centre to an excel file for direct statistical analysis and finally instant online statistical analysis of selective data decided by the scientific committee therefore the livernet is an important tool to progress in the knowledge of liver support therapies hepatic encephalopathy he represents one of the more serious extrahepatic complications associated with liver dysfunction   neuropsychiatric manifestations of he affect consciousness and behaviour evidence suggests that he develops as some neurotoxins and neuro active substances produced after hepatocellular breakdown accumulates in the brain as a consequence of a portosystemic shunt and the limited detoxification capability of the liver substances involved are ammonia manganese aromatic aminoacids mercaptans phenols medium chain fatty acids bilirubin endogenous benzodiazepines etcthe relationship between ammonia neurotoxicity and he was first described in animal studies by pavlov et al subsequently several studies in either animals or humans have confirmed that a ratio in ammonia concentration higher than 2 mm between the brain and blood stream causes he and even a comatose state when the value is greater than 5 mm some investigators have also reported a decrease in serum ammonia following a mars treatment table 3 aver sd hourspatient \u03bcgdl \u03bcgdl manganese and copper serum levels are increased in patients with either acute or acute on chronic liver failure nevertheless only in those patients with chronic hepatic dysfunction a bilateral magnetic resonance alteration on globos pallidus is observed  probably because this type of patients selectively shows higher cerebral membrane permeability imbalance between aromatic and branched chain aminoacids fischer index traditionally involved in he genesis    can be normalized following a mars treatment the effects are noticeable even after 3 hours of treatment and this reduction in the fisher index is accompanied with an improvement in the he  novelli g et al  published their three years experience on mars analyzing the impact of the treatment in the cerebral level for 63 patients reporting an improvement in glasgow coma score gcs for all observed in all patients in the last 22 patients cerebral perfusion pressure was monitored by doppler mean flow velocity in middle cerebral artery establishing a clear relationship between a clinical improvement especially neurological and an improvement in arterial cerebral perfusion this study confirms other results showing similar increments in cerebral perfusion in patients treated with mars  more recently several studies have shown a significant improvement of he in patients treated with mars in the studies by heemann et al  and sen et al  an improvement in he was considered when encephalopathy grade was reduced by one or more grades vs basal values for hassenein et al in their randomized controlled trial improvement was considered when a decrease of two grades was observed  in the latter 70 patients with acute on chronic liver failure and encephalopathy grade iii and iv were included likewise kramer et al  estimated an he improvement when an improvement in peak n70 latency in electroencephalograms was observed sen et al44 observed a significant reduction in childpugh score p001 at 7 days following a mars treatment without any significant change in the controls nevertheless when they looked at the model for endstage liver disease score meld a significant reduction in both groups mars and controls was recorded p001 y p005 respectively likewise in several case series an improvement in he grade with mars therapy is also reported          hemodynamic instability is often associated with acute liver insufficiency as a consequence of endogenous accumulation of vasoactive agents in the blood this is characterized by a systemic vasodilatation a decrease of systemic vascular resistance arterial hypotension and an increase of cardiac output that gives rise to a hyperdynamic circulationduring mars therapy systemic vascular resistance index and mean arterial pressure have been shown to increase and show improvement     schmidt et al  reported the treatment of 8 patients diagnosed with acute hepatic failure that were treated with mars for 6 hours and were compared with a control group of 5 patients to whom ice pads were applied to match the heat loss produced in the treatment group during the extracorporeal therapy they analyzed hemodynamic parameters in both groups hourly in the mars group a statistically significant increase of 46 on systemic vascular resistance was observed 1215  437 to 1778  710 dinas x s x cm  x m  compared with a 6 increase in the controls mean arterial pressure also increased 69  5 to 83  11 mmhg p 00001 in the mars group whereas no difference was observed in the controls cardiac output and heart rate also decreased in the mars group as a consequence of an improvement in the hyperdynamic circulation therefore it was shown that a statistically significant improvement was obtained with mars when compared with the smt catalina et al  have also evaluated systemic and hepatic hemodynamic changes produced by mars therapy in 4 patients with acute decompensation of chronic liver disease they observed after mars therapy an attenuation of hyperdynamic circulation and a reduction in the portal pressure gradient was measured results are summarized in table 4 there are other studies also worth mentioning with similar results heemann et al  and parés et al  among others dethloff t et al  concluded that there is a statistically significant improvement favourable to mars in comparison with prometheus system table 5 hepatorenal syndrome is one of the more serious complications in patients with an acute decompensation of cirrhosis and increased portal hypertension it is characterized by hemodynamic changes in splanchnic systemic and renal circulation splanchnic vasodilatation triggers the production of endogenous vasoactive substances that produce renal vasoconstriction and low glomerular filtration rate leading to oliguria with a concomitant reduction in creatinine clearance renal insufficiency is always progressive with a very poor prognosis   with survival at 1 and 2 months of 20 and 10 respectively pierre versin  is one of the pioneers in the study of hepatorenal syndrome in patients with liver impairment great efforts have been made trying to improve the prognosis of this type of patient however few have solved the problem orthotopic liver transplantation is the only treatment that has shown to improve acute and chronic complications derived from severe liver insufficiency today it is possible to combine albumin dialysis with continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration which provides a greater expectation for these patients  by optimization of their clinical status mars treatment lowers serum urea and creatinine levels improving their clearance     and even favors resolution of hepatorenal syndrome      results are confirmed in a randomized controlled trial published by mitzner et al  in which 13 patients diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome type i were treated with mars therapy mean survival was 252346 days in the mars group compared to 4618 days observed in the controls in whom hemodiafiltration and standard care smt was applied this resulted in a statistically significance difference in survival at 7 and 30 days p005 authors concluded that mars therapy applied to liver failure patients childpugh c and unos 2a scores who develop hepatorenal syndrome type i prolonged survival compared to patients treated with smt although mechanisms explaining previous findings are not yet fully understood it has been reported that there was a decrease in plasma rennin concentrations in patients diagnosed with acute on chronic liver failure with renal impairment that were treated with mars likewise other studies have suggested some efficacy for mars in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome   however other references have been published that do not show efficacy in the treatment of these types of patients with mars therapy khuroo et al  published a metaanalysis based in 4 small rcts and 2 non rcts in patients diagnosed with aclf concluding that mars therapy would not bring any significant increment on survival compared with smt another observational study in 6 patients with cirrhosis refractory ascitis and hepatorenal syndrome type i not responding to vasoconstrictor therapy showed no impact on hemodynamics following mars therapy however authors concluded that mars therapy could effectively serve as bridge to liver transplantation   total bilirubin was the only parameter analyzed in all trials that was always reduced in the groups of patients treated with mars banayosy et al  measured bilirubin levels 14 days after since mars therapy was terminated and observed a consistent significant decrease not only for bilirubin but also for creatinine and urea table 6 4 sessions impact of mars therapy on plasma biliary acids levels was evaluated in 3 studies in the study from stadbauer et al  that was specifically addressing the topic it is reported that mars and prometheus systems lower to the same extent biliary acids plasma concentration heemann et al  and laleman et al  have also published a significant improvement for these organic ions pruritus is one of the most common clinical manifestations in cholestasis liver diseases and one of the most distressing symptoms in patients with chronic liver disease caused by viral hepatitis c many hypothesis have been formulated to explain physio pathogenesis of such manifestation including incremental plasma concentration of biliary acids abnormalities in the bile ducts  increased central neurotransmitters coupling opioid receptors   etc despite the number of historical drugs used individually or combined exchange resins hidrophilic biliary acids antihistamines antibiotics anticonvulsants opioid antagonists there are reported cases of intractable or refractory pruritus with a dramatic reduction in patients quality of life ie sleep disorders depression suicide attempts   intractable pruritus can be an indication for liver transplantation the mars indication for intractable pruritus is therapeutically an option that has shown to be beneficial for patients in desperate cases although at high cost     in several studies it was confirmed that after mars treatments patients remain free from pruritus for a period of time ranging from 6 to 9 months  nevertheless some authors have concluded that besides the good results found in the literature application of mars therapy in refractory pruritus requires larger evidence  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for a majority of drugs can be significantly be modified with liver failure affecting the therapeutic approach and potential toxicity of the drugs in these type of patients childpugh score represents a poor prognostic factor to assess the metabolic capacity of the failing liver in patients with hepatic failure drugs that are only metabolized in the liver accumulate in the plasma right after they are administered and therefore it is needed to modify drug dosing in both concentration and time intervals to lower the risk of toxicity it is also necessary to adjust the dosing for those drugs that are exclusively metabolized by the liver and have low affinity for proteins and high distribution volume such as fluoroquinolones levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin     extracorporeal detoxification with albumin dialysis increases the clearance of drugs that are bound to plasmatic proteins table 7 in the metaanalysis published by khuroo et al  which included 4 randomized trials     an improvement in survival for the patients with liver failure treated with mars compared with smt was not observed however neither in the extracorporeal liver support systems review by the cochrane  published in 2004 nor the metaanalysis by kjaergard et al  was a significance difference in survival found for patients diagnosed with alf treated with extracorporeal liver support systems nevertheless these reviews included all kind of liver support systems and used a heterogeneous type of publication  abstracts clinical trials cohort etc there is literature showing favorable results in survival for patients diagnosed with alf and treated with mars in a randomized controlled trial salibà et al  studied the impact on survival of mars therapy for patients with alf waiting on the liver transplant list fortynine patients received smt and 53 were treated with mars they observed that patients that received 3 or more mars sessions showed a statistically significance increase in transplantfree survival compared with the others patients of the study notably 75 of the patients underwent liver transplantation in the first 24 hours after inclusion in the waiting list and besides the short exposure to mars therapy some patients showed a better survival trend compared to controls when they were treated with mars prior to the transplant in a casecontrolled study by montejo et al  it was reported that mars treatment do not decrease mortality directly however the treatment contributed to significantly improve survival in patients that were transplanted in studies by mitzner et al  and heemann et al  they were able to show a significance statistical difference in 30 day survival for patients in the mars group however el banayosy et al  and hassanein et al  noticed a non significant improvement in survival probably because of the short number of patients included in the trials in the majority of available mars studies published with patients diagnosed with alf either transplanted or not survival was greater in the mars group with some variations according to the type of trial ranging from 2030   and 6080     data is summarized in tables 8 9 and 10   mars  controls for patients diagnosed with acute on chronic liver failure and treated with mars therapy clinical trial results showed a not statistically significant reduction in mortality odds ratio or 078 confident interval ci 95 058  103 p 01059 figure 3 a nonstatistically significant reduction of mortality was shown in patients with alf treated with mars or  075 ci 95 042  135 p 03427 figure 4 combined results yielded a nonsignificant reduction on mortality in patients treated with mars therapy however the low number of patients included in each of the studies may be responsible for not being able to achieve enough statistical power to show differences between both treatment groups moreover heterogeneity for the number of mars sessions and severity of liver disease of the patients included make it very difficult for the evaluation of mars impact on survival recently a metaanalysis on survival in patients treated with an extrahepatic therapy has been published  searching strategies yielded 74 clinical trials 17 randomized controlled trials 5 case control and 52 cohort studies eight studies were included in the metaanalysis three addressing acute liver failure one with mars therapy  and five addressing acute on chronic being four mars related     authors concluded that extrahepatic detoxifying systems improve survival for acute liver insufficiency whereas results for acute decompensation of chronic liver diseases suggested a non significant survival benefit also due to an increased demand for liver transplantation together with an augmented risk of liver failure following large resections development of detoxifying extrahepatic systems are necessary safety defined as presence of adverse events is evaluated in few trials adverse events in patients receiving mars therapy are similar to those in the controls with the exception of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage that seems to occur more frequently with the mars system  heemann et al  reported two adverse events most probably mars related fever and sepsis presumably originated at the catheter in the study by hassanein et al  two patients in the mars group abandoned the study owing to hemodynamic instability three patients required larger than average platelets transfusion and three more patients presented gastrointestinal bleeding laleman et al  detected one patient with thrombocytopenia in both the mars and prometheus treatment groups and an additional patient with clotting of the dialysis circuit and hypotension only in the prometheus group kramer et al biologicdt  wrote about 3 cases with disseminated intravascular coagulation in the interventional group two of them with fatal outcomes mitzner et al  described among patients treated with mars a thrombocytopenia case and a second patient with chronic hepatitis b who underwent tips placement on day 44 after randomization and died on day 105 of multiorgan failure as a consequence of complications related to the tips procedure montejo et al  showed that mars is an easy technique without serious adverse events related to the procedure and also easy to implement in icu settings that are used to renal extracorporeal therapies the mars international registry with data from more than 500 patients although sponsored by the manufacturer shows that the adverse effects observed are similar to the control group however in these severely ill patients it is difficult to distinguish between complications of the disease itself and side effects attributable to the technique only three studies addressing costeffectivenenss of mars therapy have been found hassanein et al  analysed costs of randomized patients with aclf receiving mars therapy or standard medical care they used the study published in 2001 by kim et al  describing the impact of complications in hospitalization costs in patients diagnosed with alcoholic liver failure cost of 11 patients treated with standard medical care smt were compared to those that received mars in addition to smt 12 patients in the mars group there was less inhospital mortality and complications related to the disease with a remarkable reduction in cost which compensated the mars related expenditure table 11 n12 n11 there were 5 survivors in the control group with a cost per patient of 35904 whereas in the mars group 11 patients out of 12 survived with a cost per patient of 32036 which represents a 4000 savings per patient in favors of the mars group hessel et al  published a 3year followup of a cohort of 79 patients with aclf of whom 33 received mars treatments and 46 received smt survival was 67 for the mars group and 63 for the controls that was reduced to 58 and 35 respectively at one year followup and then 52 and 17 at three years hospitalization costs for the mars treated group were greater than that for the controls 31539 vs 7543 and similarly direct cost at 3year followup 8493 vs 5194 nevertheless after adjusting mortality rate the annual cost per patient was 12092 for controls and 5827 for mars group also in the latter they found an incremental costeffectiveness ratio of 31448  per lifeyear gained lyg and an incremental costs per qaly gained of 47171  two years later same authors published the results of 149 patients diagnosed with aclf  there were 67 patients 449 treated with mars and 82 patients 551 were allocated to receive smt mean survival time was 692 days in the mars group 33 at 3 years and 453 days in the controls 15 at 3 years the results were significant p0022 differences in average cost was 19853 95 ic 1330825429 35639  for mars patients and 15804  for the control group incremental cost per lyg was 29985  95 ic 9441321761 and 43040 95 ic 13551461856 per qualityadjusted life years qaly liver support systems such as mars are very important to stabilize patients with acute or acute on chronic liver failure and avoid organ dysfunction as well as a bridgetotransplant although initial inhospital costs are high they are worth for the favorable outcome etiology goals of mars therapy mars therapy indication treatment schedule etiology goals of mars therapy mars therapy

although it is determined by the technical specifications of the combined machine and catheters size intermittent treatments continuous treatments dyalisate flow rate intermittent treatments continuous treatments replacement flow rate heparin anticoagulation similarly to cvvhd it depends of previous patients coagulation status in many cases it will not be needed unless the patient presents a ptt inferior to 160 seconds in patients with normal values a bolus of 5000 to 10000 iu of heparin could be administered at the commencement of the treatment followed by a continuous perfusion to keep ptt in ratios from 15 to 25 or 160 to 180 seconds monitoring a biochemical analysis is recommended liver and kidney profile ionic glucose together with a hemogram at the end of first session and before starting the following one coagulation analysis must be also performed before starting the session to adjusting heparin dose in case that medication susceptible to be eliminated by mars is being administered it is also recommended to monitor their levels in blood end of the session and both catheters lumens heparinized federal drug administration fda cleared in a document dated on may 27 2005 mars therapy for the treatment of drug overdose and poisoning the only requirement is that the drug or poison must be susceptible to be dialysed and removed by activated charcoal or anionic exchange resins more recently on december 17 2012 mars therapy has been cleared by the fda for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy due to a decompensation of a chronic liver disese clinical trials conducted with mars treatment in he patients having a decompensation of chronic liver disease demonstrated a transient effect from mars treatments to significantly decrease their hepatic encephalopathy scores by at least 2 grades compared to standard medical therapy smt the mars is not indicated as a bridge to liver transplant safety and efficacy has not been demonstrated in controlled randomized clinical trials the effectiveness of the mars device in patients that are sedated could not be established in clinical studies and therefore cannot be predicted in sedated

V the cardiovascular centre is a part of the human brain responsible for the regulation of the rate at which the heart beats through the nervous and endocrine systems it is found in the medulla normally the heart beats without nervous control but in some situations eg exercise body trauma the cardiovascular centre is responsible for altering the rate at which the heart beats it also mediates respiratory sinus arrhythmia when a change of blood ph is detected by chemoreceptors or a change of blood pressure is detected by stretch receptors in aortic and carotid bodies the cardiovascular centre effects changes to the heart rate by sending nerve impulse to pacemaker or sa node via sympathetic fibres to cause faster and stronger cardiac muscle contraction and the vagus nerve to cause slower and less strong cardiac muscle contraction the cardiovascular centre also increases the stroke volume of the heart that is the amount of blood it pumps these two changes help to regulate the cardiac output so that a sufficient amount of blood reaches tissue hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine can affect the cardiovascular centre and cause it to increase the rate of impulses sent to the sinoatrial node or cardiac pacemaker resulting in faster and stronger cardiac muscles contraction and thus increasing the rate of the heart beat chemoreceptors may also prompt this regulation

V liver is the only visceral organ that possesses remarkable capacity to regenerate   liver can regenerate after either surgical removal or after chemical injury  it is known that as little as 25 of the original liver mass can regenerate back to its full size   the process of regeneration in mammals is mainly compensatory growth because only the mass of the liver is replaced not the shape  however in lower species such as fish both liver size and shape can be replaced  liver regeneration involves replication of the liver cells mainly hepatocytes followed by other cells such as biliary epithelial cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells once cell proliferation is completed the newly divided cells undergo restructuring angiogenesis and reformation of extracellular matrix to complete the regeneration process  interestingly in most cases liver function is only partially affected during liver regeneration whereas certain specialized functions such as drug metabolism decrease many other primary functions such as albumin and bile production are not substantially affected  two main type of models are used to study liver regeneration including surgical removal also referred to as partial hepatectomy phx and chemicalinduced liver damage whereas the mechanisms and kinetics of liver regeneration in these two models are different many of the same signaling pathways stimulate liver regeneration in both pathways  liver regeneration is highly controlled process regulated by complex network on highly redundant signals several signaling pathways are known to stimulate regeneration in the liver including cytokines growth factors hormones and nuclear receptors  the ability of liver to regenerate is central to liver homeostasis because liver is the major site of drug detoxification it is exposed to many chemicals in the body which can induce cell death and injury liver can regenerate damaged tissue rapidly and thus prevents liver failure liver regeneration is also critical for patients of liver diseases where partial removal of liver due to fibrosis or tumor is a common therapy which relies on ability of the remaining liver to regenerate back

V p3 peptide also known as amyloid \u03b2 peptide a\u03b2174042 is the peptide resulting from the \u03b1 and \u03b3secretase cleavage from the amyloid precursor protein app it is known to be the major constituent of diffuse plaques observed in alzheimers disease ad brains and preamyloid plaques in people affected of down syndrome however p3 peptides role in these diseases is not truly known yet    there is little information related to the p3 peptides composition and structure and moreover most of it has to do with characteristics that concern to its roll in alzheimers disease p3 can be found as a 24 or 26 residues peptide depending on which is gamma secretases cleavage the peptide which has 26 residues presents the following sequence in relation to the secondary structure of p3 peptide it is thought that after the cleavage by the \u03b1 and \u03b3 secretases and extraction from the membrane it would convert quickly from the \u03b1helix conformation it has when it is part of apps\u03b1 sequence to a \u03b2hairpin structure then this highly hydrophobic monomer would rapidly evolve into fibrils with no soluble intermediate forms the ones related to amyloids structure the main reason why p3 does not aggregate in amyloidogenic forms while a\u03b2 does is that the nterminal domain a\u03b2116 which is present in a\u03b2s sequence but not in p3s one is known to protect the hydrophobic core of the oligomers from being dissolved by the watered medium so p3 peptide oligomers would likely expose hydrophobic residues to water and would be less stable as a consequence p3 peptide structural determinants can assemble into fibrils but no oligomeric forms have been identified that is why p3 peptide represents the benign form of amyloid  energy plays a very important role in p3 peptides while a\u03b2 models have a strong negative energy p3 oligomeric models have a positive one another characteristic that must be pointed out is that p3 peptides have more solventexposed hydrophobic surfaces 60 than a\u03b2 oligomers do 20 so buried surface areas are not as big within p3 oligomers 30 as they are within a\u03b2 oligomers these evidences show that the expected energy of the a\u03b2based oligomeric models of p3 is always positive and that these models expose hydrophobic patches to the solvent and bury a small proportion of their accessible surface within the oligomeric intermediates having these facts into account we can state that p3 oligomers existence is thermodynamically unfavourable which suggests that the p3 peptide cannot form stable soluble oligomers in the same way a\u03b2 does solution of p3 cannot assemble into stable oligomers as a\u03b2142 in the same concentration does therefore if it is very possible that p3 could not last long by itself evolving rapidly into fibrillar forms that hide exposed hydrophobic patches  p3 peptides have been analyzed in some researches with western blot techniques primary antibodies were used to recognize a\u03b2116 residues unexpectedly it was found out that the residues did not show any signal this confirms the absence of nterminal domain a\u03b2116 in p3 peptides  p3 peptide generates from the 1740 or 1742 sequence of the amyloid precursor protein app which is a type i integral membrane protein concerned in neurons synapses in many human tissues under normal physiological conditions app is processed with three different proteolytic enzymes \u03b1 \u03b2 and \u03b3secretases at first app molecule is cut by \u03b1secretase or \u03b2secretase and it will produce two different molecules for each case these products are respectively apps\u03b1 or \u03b1ctfs when cut by \u03b1secretase or apps\u03b2 and \u03b2ctfs when processed by \u03b2 secretase apps derivates are sent both to the extracell while ctfs rest anchored to the plasmatic membrane then \u03b2 and \u03b1ctfs are processed by \u03b3secretase resulting the peptides p3 and a\u03b2 respectively and releasing in both cases a cytoplasmic peptide fragment known as the app intracellular domain aicd both p3 and a\u03b2 are sent to the extracellular medium  p3 peptide is known to have a role in ad and ds however it has not been clearly determined yet in order to study the function of p3 peptide in ad specific antibodies location techniques have been used to determine its absence or sparseness in aged nonad brains as it turns out p3 peptide is prevalent in selected areas of ad brain in diffuse deposits and in a subset of dystrophic neuritis both located in the temporal lobe limbic system  although p3 peptide can assemble into fibrillar aggregates its hydrophobic properties make it unable to rest in oligomeric forms this might explain why p3 has no impact on synaptic function and therefore in ad since it is a nonamyloidogenic product of app  despite this fact p3 has been proved to have a role in formation of nonfibrillar deposits or lesions associated with ds another neurological disorder that progresses at a faster rate than ad accordingly ds patients have three copies of the app gene as they have three copies of the chromosome 21 so app is overexpressed in the brain and ad develops at an early age the disruption of the normal function of app in ad and consequently in ds including overexpression or altered processes is the most likely explanation for amyloid plaque formation and subsequent neuronal loss and dementia associated to memory spatial disorientation and deterioration of intellectual capacity  since p3 has not been studied deeply there are different opinions about its role in brain on the one hand p3 is supposed to be neuroprotective in brain affections and consequently in ad that is the reason why shifting app processing to the \u03b1secretase pathway could be used as a method of decreasing \u03b2secretase amyloidogenic processing of app as a therapeutic approach in ad  on the other hand p3 peptides are thought to have a role in neuronal death and in the enhanced inflammatory response in ad and ds as it has been demonstrated that the treatment of cells with the p3 fragment induced by the cjun nterminal kinases jnk phosphorylation is involved in neuronal cells apoptosis and causes the death of shsy5y and imr32 human neuroblastoma cells

V the kidneys are beanshaped organs that serve several essential regulatory roles in vertebrates they remove excess organic molecules from the blood and it is by this action that their bestknown function is performed the removal of waste products of metabolism kidneys are essential to the urinary system and also serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of electrolytes maintenance of acidbase balance and regulation of blood pressure via maintaining the salt and water balance they serve the body as a natural filter of the blood and remove watersoluble wastes which are diverted to the bladder in producing urine the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium they are also responsible for the reabsorption of water glucose and amino acids the kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol and erythropoietin an important enzyme renin is also produced in the kidneys which acts in negative feedback located at the rear of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneal space the kidneys receive blood from the paired renal arteries and drain into the paired renal veins each kidney excretes urine into a ureter which empties into the bladder renal physiology is the study of kidney function while nephrology is the medical specialty concerned with kidney diseases diseases of the kidney are diverse but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes renal cysts acute kidney injury chronic kidney disease urinary tract infection nephrolithiasis and urinary tract obstruction  various cancers of the kidney exist the most common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma cancers cysts and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney this is known as nephrectomy when renal function measured by the glomerular filtration rate is persistently poor dialysis and kidney transplantation may be treatment options although they are not normally harmful kidney stones can be extremely painful   in humans the kidneys are located in the abdominal cavity one on each side of the spine and lie in a retroperitoneal position at a slightly oblique angle  the asymmetry within the abdominal cavity caused by the position of the liver typically results in the right kidney being slightly lower and smaller than the left and being placed slightly more to the middle than the left kidney    the left kidney is approximately at the vertebral level t12 to l3  and the right is slightly lower the right kidney sits just below the diaphragm and posterior to the liver the left sits below the diaphragm and posterior to the spleen on top of each kidney is an adrenal gland the upper parts of the kidneys are partially protected by the 11th and 12th ribs each kidney with its adrenal gland is surrounded by two layers of fat the perirenal and pararenal fat and the renal fascia in adult males the kidney weighs between 125 and 170grams in females the weight of the kidney is between 115 and 155grams  the kidney has a beanshaped structure having a convex and a concave border a recessed area on the concave border is the renal hilum where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein and ureter leave the kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue the renal capsule which is itself surrounded by perirenal fat adipose capsule renal fascia and pararenal fat paranephric body the anterior front surface of these tissues is the peritoneum while the posterior rear surface is the transversalis fascia the superior pole of the right kidney is adjacent to the liver for the left kidney its next to the spleen both therefore move down upon inhalation the kidney is approximately 1114cm 4355in in length 6cm 24in wide and 4cm 16in thick the substance or parenchyma of the kidney is divided into two major structures the outer renal cortex and the inner renal medulla grossly these structures take the shape of eight to 18 coneshaped renal lobes each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a renal pyramid of malpighi  between the renal pyramids are projections of cortex called renal columns or bertin columns nephrons the urineproducing functional structures of the kidney span the cortex and medulla the initial filtering portion of a nephron is the renal corpuscle which is located in the cortex this is followed by a renal tubule that passes from the cortex deep into the medullary pyramids part of the renal cortex a medullary ray is a collection of renal tubules that drain into a single collecting duct the tip or papilla of each pyramid empties urine into a minor calyx minor calyces empty into major calyces and major calyces empty into the renal pelvis this becomes the ureter at the hilum the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney and the renal artery enters hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes surrounds these structures the hilar fat is contiguous with a fatfilled cavity called the renal sinus the renal sinus collectively contains the renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary tissue  the renal circulation supplies the blood to the kidneys via the renal arteries left and right which branch directly from the abdominal aorta despite their relatively small size the kidneys receive approximately 20 of the cardiac output  each renal artery branches into segmental arteries dividing further into interlobar arteries which penetrate the renal capsule and extend through the renal columns between the renal pyramids the interlobar arteries then supply blood to the arcuate arteries that run through the boundary of the cortex and the medulla each arcuate artery supplies several interlobular arteries that feed into the afferent arterioles that supply the glomeruli the medullary interstitium is the functional space in the kidney beneath the individual filters glomeruli which are rich in blood vessels the interstitium absorbs fluid recovered from urine various conditions can lead to scarring and congestion of this area which can cause kidney dysfunction and failure after filtration occurs the blood moves through a small network of venules that converge into interlobular veins as with the arteriole distribution the veins follow the same pattern the interlobular provide blood to the arcuate veins then back to the interlobar veins which come to form the renal vein exiting the kidney for transfusion for blood renal histology studies the microscopic structure of the kidney distinct cell types include the renal artery enters into the kidney at the level of the first lumbar vertebra just below the superior mesenteric artery as it enters the kidney it divides into branches first the segmental artery which divides into 2 or 3 lobar arteries then further divides into interlobar arteries which further divide into the arcuate artery which leads into the interlobular artery which form afferent arterioles the afferent arterioles form the glomerulus network of capillaries enclosed in bowmans capsule from here efferent arterioles leaves the glomerulus and divide into peritubular capillaries which drain into the interlobular veins and then into arcuate vein and then into interlobar vein which runs into lobar vein which opens into the segmental vein and which drains into the renal vein and then from it blood moves into the inferior vena cava the kidney and nervous system communicate via the renal plexus whose fibers course along the renal arteries to reach each kidney  input from the sympathetic nervous system triggers vasoconstriction in the kidney thereby reducing renal blood flow  the kidney also receives input from the parasympathetic nervous system by way of the renal branches of the vagus nerve cranial nerve x the function of this is yet unclear   sensory input from the kidney travels to the t1011 levels of the spinal cord and is sensed in the corresponding dermatome  thus pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney  the mammalian kidney develops from intermediate mesoderm kidney development also called nephrogenesis proceeds through a series of three successive developmental phases the pronephros mesonephros and metanephros  the kidney participates in wholebody homeostasis regulating acidbase balance electrolyte concentrations extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure the kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and in concert with other organs particularly those of the endocrine system various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions these include renin angiotensin ii aldosterone antidiuretic hormone and atrial natriuretic peptide among others many of the kidneys functions are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of filtration reabsorption and secretion which take place in the nephron filtration which takes place at the renal corpuscle is the process by which cells and large proteins are filtered from the blood to make an ultrafiltrate that eventually becomes urine the kidney generates 180 liters of filtrate a day while reabsorbing a large percentage allowing for the generation of only approximately 2 liters of urine reabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and into the blood secretion is the reverse process in which molecules are transported in the opposite direction from the blood into the urine the kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by metabolism into the urine these include the nitrogenous wastes urea from protein catabolism and uric acid from nucleic acid metabolism the ability of mammals and some birds to concentrate wastes into a volume of urine much smaller than the volume of blood from which the wastes were extracted is dependent on an elaborate countercurrent multiplication mechanism this requires several independent nephron characteristics to operate a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules water and ion permeability in the descending limb of the loop water impermeability in the ascending loop and active ion transport out of most of the ascending limb in addition passive countercurrent exchange by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the nephron is essential for enabling this function glucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule the mechanism for this is the na glucose cotransporter a plasma level of 350mgdl will fully saturate the transporters and glucose will be lost in the urine a plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to allow glucosuria which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus amino acids are reabsorbed by sodium dependent transporters in the proximal tubule hartnup disease is a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter which results in pellagra    pregnancy reduces the reabsorption of glucose and amino acids two organ systems the kidneys and lungs maintain acidbase homeostasis which is the maintenance of ph around a relatively stable value the lungs contribute to acidbase homeostasis by regulating carbon dioxide co2 concentration the kidneys have two very important roles in maintaining the acidbase balance to reabsorb and regenerate bicarbonate from urine and to excrete hydrogen ions and fixed acids anions of acids into urine any significant rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland an increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone adh resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration the two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels adh binds to principal cells in the collecting duct that translocate aquaporins to the membrane allowing water to leave the normally impermeable membrane and be reabsorbed into the body by the vasa recta thus increasing the plasma volume of the body there are two systems that create a hyperosmotic medulla and thus increase the body plasma volume urea recycling and the single effect urea is usually excreted as a waste product from the kidneys however when plasma blood volume is low and adh is released the aquaporins that are opened are also permeable to urea this allows urea to leave the collecting duct into the medulla creating a hyperosmotic solution that attracts water urea can then reenter the nephron and be excreted or recycled again depending on whether adh is still present or not the single effect describes the fact that the ascending thick limb of the loop of henle is not permeable to water but is permeable to nacl this allows for a countercurrent exchange system whereby the medulla becomes increasingly concentrated but at the same time setting up an osmotic gradient for water to follow should the aquaporins of the collecting duct be opened by adh although the kidney cannot directly sense blood longterm regulation of blood pressure predominantly depends upon the kidney this primarily occurs through maintenance of the extracellular fluid compartment the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration renin is the first in a series of important chemical messengers that make up the reninangiotensin system changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system principally the hormones angiotensin ii and aldosterone each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms but both increase the kidneys absorption of sodium chloride thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure when renin levels are elevated the concentrations of angiotensin ii and aldosterone increase leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment and an increase in blood pressure conversely when renin levels are low angiotensin ii and aldosterone levels decrease contracting the extracellular fluid compartment and decreasing blood pressure the kidneys secrete a variety of hormones including erythropoietin and the enzyme renin erythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia low levels of oxygen at tissue level in the renal circulation it stimulates erythropoiesis production of red blood cells in the bone marrow calcitriol the activated form of vitamin d promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption of phosphate part of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system renin is an enzyme involved in the regulation of aldosterone levels calculations of kidney performance are an important part of physiology and can be estimated using the calculations below the filtration fraction is the amount of plasma that is actually filtered through the kidney this can be defined using the equation ffgfrrpf normal human ff is 20 renal clearance is the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely cleared from the blood per unit time cxuxvpx the kidney is a very complex organ and numerical modelling has been used to better understand kidney function at several scales including fluid uptake and secretion   nephropathy is kidney disease or damage to a kidney nephrosis is noninflammatory nephropathy and nephritis is inflammatory kidney disease nephrology is the speciality that deals with kidney function and disease medical terms related to the kidneys commonly use terms such as renal and the prefix nephro the adjective renal meaning related to the kidney is from the latin r\u0113n\u0113s meaning kidneys the prefix nephro is from the ancient greek word for kidney nephros \u03bd\u03b5\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2  for example surgical removal of the kidney is a nephrectomy while a reduction in kidney function is called renal dysfunction generally humans can live normally with just one kidney as one has more functioning renal tissue than is needed to survive only when the amount of functioning kidney tissue is greatly diminished does one develop chronic kidney disease renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or kidney transplantation is indicated when the glomerular filtration rate has fallen very low or if the renal dysfunction leads to severe symptoms many renal diseases are diagnosed on the basis of classical clinical findings a physician usually a nephrologist begins by taking a detailed clinical history and performs a physical examination in addition to medical history and presenting symptoms a physician will ask about medication history family history recent infections toxicchemical exposures and other historical factors that may indicate an etiology for the patients renal disease often some diseases are suggested by clinical history and time course alone for example in a formerly healthy child with a recent upper respiratory tract infection and faciallower limb swelling findings of proteinuria on urinalysis a diagnosis of minimal change disease is highly suggested similarly a patient with a history of diabetes who presents with decreased urine output is most likely to be suffering from diabetic nephropathy often such cases do not require extensive workup such as with renal biopsy a presumptive diagnosis can be made on the basis of history physical exam and supportive laboratory studies laboratory studies are an important adjunct to clinical evaluation for assessment of renal function an initial workup of a patient may include a complete blood count cbc serum electrolytes including sodium potassium chloride bicarbonate calcium and phosphorus blood urea nitrogen and creatinine blood glucose and glycocylated hemoglobin glomerular filtration rate gfr can be calculated  urine studies may include urine electrolytes creatinine protein fractional excretion of sodium fena and other studies to assist in evaluation of the etiology of a patients renal disease urinalysis is used to evaluate urine for its ph protein glucose specific gravity and the presence of blood microscopic analysis can be helpful in the identification of casts red blood cells white blood cells and crystals  imaging studies are important in the evaluation of structural renal disease caused by urinary tract obstruction renal stones renal cyst mass lesions renal vascular disease and vesicoureteral reflux  imaging techniques used most frequently include renal ultrasound and helical ct scan patients with suspected vesicoureteral reflux may undergo voiding cystourethrogram vcug the role of the renal biopsy is to diagnose renal disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means clinical history past medical history medication history physical exam laboratory studies imaging studies a detailed description of renal biopsy interpretation is beyond the scope of this article in general a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate the morphologic findings with the clinical history and laboratory data ultimately arriving at a pathological diagnosis a renal pathologist is a physician who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially training in the interpretation of renal biopsy specimens ideally multiple core sections are obtained and evaluated for adequacy presence of glomeruli intraoperatively a pathologistpathology assistant divides the specimens for submission for light microscopy immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy the pathologist will examine the specimen using light microscopy with multiple staining techniques hematoxylin and eosinhe pas trichrome silver stain on multiple level sections multiple immunofluorescence stains are performed to evaluate for antibody protein and complement deposition finally ultrastructural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal the presence of electrondense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities that may suggest an etiology for the patients renal disease in the majority of vertebrates the mesonephros persists into the adult albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros only in amniotes is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo the kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow elongated organs occupying a significant portion of the trunk the collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an archinephric duct which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes however the situation is not always so simple in cartilaginous fish and some amphibians there is also a shorter duct similar to the amniote ureter which drains the posterior metanephric parts of the kidney and joins with the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca indeed in many cartilaginous fish the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult  in the most primitive vertebrates the hagfish and lampreys the kidney is unusually simple it consists of a row of nephrons each emptying directly into the archinephric duct invertebrates may possess excretory organs that are sometimes referred to as kidneys but even in amphioxus these are never homologous with the kidneys of vertebrates and are more accurately referred to by other names such as nephridia  in amphibians kidneys and the urinary bladder harbour specialized parasites monogeneans of the family polystomatidae  the kidneys of reptiles consist of a number of lobules arranged in a broadly linear pattern each lobule contains a single branch of the ureter in its centre into which the collecting ducts empty reptiles have relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size possibly because of their lower metabolic rate  birds have relatively large elongated kidneys each of which is divided into three or more distinct lobes the lobes consists of several small irregularly arranged lobules each centred on a branch of the ureter birds have small glomeruli but about twice as many nephrons as similarly sized mammals  the human kidney is fairly typical of that of mammals distinctive features of the mammalian kidney in comparison with that of other vertebrates include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids and of a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla the latter feature is due to the presence of elongated loops of henle these are much shorter in birds and not truly present in other vertebrates although the nephron often has a short intermediate segment between the convoluted tubules it is only in mammals that the kidney takes on its classical kidney shape although there are some exceptions such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds and cetaceans  kidneys of various animals show evidence of evolutionary adaptation and have long been studied in ecophysiology and comparative physiology kidney morphology often indexed as the relative medullary thickness is associated with habitat aridity among species of mammals  and diet eg carnivores have only long loops of henle  the kidneys like other offal can be cooked and eaten kidneys are usually grilled or sautéed but in more complex dishes they are stewed with a sauce that will improve their flavor in many preparations kidneys are combined with pieces of meat or liver as in mixed grill or meurav yerushalmi dishes include the british steak and kidney pie the swedish hökarpanna pork and kidney stew the french rognons de veau sauce moutarde veal kidneys in mustard sauce and the spanish riñones al jerez kidneys stewed in sherry sauce   the latin term renes is related to the english word reins a synonym for the kidneys in shakespearean english eg merry wives of windsor 35 which was also the time when the king james version of the bible was translated kidneys were once popularly regarded as the seat of the conscience and reflection   and a number of verses in the bible eg ps 79 rev 223 state that god searches out and inspects the kidneys or reins of humans together with the heart similarly the talmud berakhoth 61a states that one of the two kidneys counsels what is good and the other evil according to studies in modern and ancient hebrew various body organs in humans and animals served also an emotional or logical role today mostly attributed to the brain and the endocrine system the kidney is mentioned in several biblical verses in conjunction with the heart much as the bowels were understood to be the seat of emotion  grief joy and pain  in the sacrifices offered at the biblical tabernacle and later on at the temple in jerusalem the priests were instructed   to remove the kidneys and the adrenal gland covering the kidneys of the sheep goat and cattle offerings and to burn them on the altar as the holy part of the offering for god never to be eaten  in ancient india according to the ayurvedic medical systems the kidneys were considered the beginning of the excursion channels system the head of the mutra srotas receiving from all other systems and therefore important in determining a persons health balance and temperament by the balance and mixture of the three doshas  the three health elements vatha or vata  air pitta  bile and kapha  mucus the temperament and health of a person can then be seen in the resulting color of the urine  modern ayurveda practitioners a practice which is characterized as pseudoscience  have attempted to revive these methods in medical procedures as part of ayurveda urine therapy  these procedures have been called nonsensical by skeptics  in ancient egypt the kidneys like the heart were left inside the mummified bodies unlike other organs which were removed comparing this to the biblical statements and to drawings of human body with the heart and two kidneys portraying a set of scales for weighing justice it seems that the egyptian beliefs had also connected the kidneys with judgement and perhaps with moral decisions  kidney posterior view

V organ trade is the trade of human organs for the purpose of transplantation as of 2011  about 90000 people were reported to be waiting for a new organ  on average an individual will wait three and a half years for an organ to become available for transplant  there is a worldwide shortage of organs available for transplantation  yet commercial trade in human organs was at one point illegal in all countries except iran the legal status of organ trade however is changing around the world for example in 2013 both australia and singapore legalized financial compensation for living organ donors   illegal organ trafficking is widespread but data on the extent of the black market is difficult to obtain the question of whether to legalize the organ trade to combat illegal trafficking and organ shortage is hotly debated   iran is the only nation that allows organs to be bought and sold legally however it does place restrictions on the commercial organ trade in an attempt to limit transplant tourism the market is contained within the country that is foreigners are not allowed to buy the organs of iranian citizens additionally organs can only be transplanted between people of the same nationality  so for example an iranian cannot purchase a kidney from a refugee from another country  the system is largely charity and volunteerbased and those tasked with matching donors and patients are not paid for their work  proponents of legalized organ trade have hailed the iranian system as an example of an effective and safe organ trading model an article in the clinical journal of the american society of nephrology notes that the iranian model has avoided many problems associated with organ trade the article points out that every other solution attempted in other developing countries has failed even to slow down the continual growth of organ transplant waitlists  as noted above australia and singapore recently legalized monetary compensation for living organ donors kidney disease advocacy organizations in both countries have expressed their support for this new initiative   all other nations have some form of legislation meant to prevent the illegal trading of organs whether by an outright ban or through legislation that limits how and by whom donations can be made many countries including brazil belgium and france use a system of presumed consent to increase the amount of legal organs available for transplant   in the united states federal law prohibits the sale of organs however the government has created initiatives to encourage organ gifting and to compensate those who freely donate their organs in 2004 the state of wisconsin began providing tax deductions to living donors  worldwide the current trend is toward increased regulation of organ trading in irans legal markets the price of a kidney ranges from 2000 to 4000   on the black market however the price may be above 160000 most of which is taken by middlemen  additionally when done through black marketaffiliated medical providers the transplant operation is dangerous to both the donor and recipient and the recipient often contracts hepatitis or hiv  the typical price paid to donors on the black market is thought to be about us5000 but some donors receive as little as 1000  in pakistan travel and hospital expenses of about 500 are usually deducted from the agreedupon price after blackmarket kidney transplants  in the 1970s pharmaceuticals that prevent organ rejection were introduced this along with a lack of medical regulation helped foster the organ market living donor procedures include kidney liver cornea and lung transplants most organ trade involves kidney or liver transplants in 2014 robert d truog center for bioethics of harvard medical schools department of global health and social medicine wrote an open letter to president barack obama and other us leaders supporting the creation of pilot projects to study forms of compensating live kidney donors  a number of health professionals transplant professionals ethicists lawyers religious leaders academics and other supporters cosigned the letter in the letter and in an earlier paper published in the new england journal of medicine truog addresses the urgent need for additional kidney donors the transplant procedures low safety risks the significant decrease in financial costs morbidity and mortality rates associated with kidney transplants and the ability to implement a system of compensated kidney donation with stringent government regulations and ethical safeguards  other safetyrelated arguments include the following the legal trade on blood donation in the us already produces much more blood donation than the uncompensated donation system in britain decades ago concerns about the quality of traded blood or organs were a main cause of opposition however proponents of organ trade argue that screening technology is now sufficiently efficient to guarantee the safety of traded organs  due to organ shortage many transplanted organs are taken from the cadavers of elderly or ill people which has at times led to the organs failing or containing cancers however waiting for a better organ can be dangerous since those remaining on waitlists have a high risk of death  professors becker and elias note that impulsive or unthinking donations could be prevented via a written consent with a compulsory waiting period  they also argue that noncompensated organ donors may equally make impulsive donation decisions bioethicist gregory pence has expressed concerns about the intense social pressure that family friends or employees often feel to donate to a patient  some transplant centers reportedly solve this problem by inventing a medical excuse for reluctant donors  monetary compensation has been suggested as a solution as the availability of more organs would lessen the pressure on friends and family to donate  china has no organized system of organ donations  since the late 1980s there have been multiple indications that executed prisoners are the main and essentially the only source of organs and tissues for chinese transplant programs  although using executed prisoners organs is legal in china there is evidence that the government attempted to downplay the scope of organ harvesting through confidentiality agreements  and laws such as the temporary rules concerning the utilization of corpses or organs from the corpses of executed prisoners  nevertheless china still suffered a shortage of organs for transplant the kilgourmatas report  found that there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling falun gong practitioners  confirming an earlier report  shortly after reports of organ harvesting emerged government leaders announced new legislation banning use of organs without consent  however over a year later this law did not appear to have been implemented  the chinese government also passed legislation ending the legal sale of organs however no legislation currently prohibits the collection of organs from deceased inmates who sign agreements before being executed china also introduced new legislation aimed at standardizing its organ collection process this legislation includes regulations specifying which hospitals can perform operations and standardizing the legal definition of brain death additionally the legislation banned foreign transplant patients  in a 2009 interview manfred nowak the united nations special rapporteur on torture said the chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparent  it remains to be seen how it could be possible that organ transplant surgeries in chinese hospitals have risen massively since 1999 while there are never that many voluntary donors available  nowak submitted two reports to the united nations human rights council formally requesting that the chinese government respond to the allegations  before the passage of the transplantation of human organs act thoa in 1994 india had a successful legal organ trading market low costs and high availability brought in business from around the globe and transformed india into one of the largest kidney transplant centers in the world  however several problems began to surface in some cases patients were unaware that a kidney transplant even took place  in other cases patients were promised payments that were much higher than what they actually received  these and other ethical issues pushed the indian government to pass legislation banning the sale of organs  nevertheless current laws still contain loopholes for example the thoa states that an organ donor must be a relative spouse or an individual donating for reasons of affection for the recipient often claims of affection are unfounded and the organ donor has no connection to the recipient  in many cases the donor may not be indian or even speak the same language as the recipient  in iran it remains legal to sell a kidney for profit iran currently has no waitlists for kidney transplantation  kidney sales are legal and regulated the charity association for the support of kidney patients caskp and the charity foundation for special diseases cfsd control the trade of organs with the support of the government these notforprofit organizations match donors to recipients setting up tests to ensure compatibility the compensation paid to the donor varies but an average kidney donor is paid 1200  some donors are also offered employment opportunities charity organizations support recipients that cannot afford the cost of the organ  some critics argue that the iranian system is in some ways coercive as over 70 of donors are considered poor by iranian standards  there is no shortterm or longterm followup on the health of organ donors  in fact there is evidence that iranian donors experience highly negative outcomes both in terms of health and emotional wellbeing  before 2008 the sale of organs was legal in the philippines and the country was a popular destination for transplant tourism the philippine information agency a branch of the government even promoted allinclusive kidney transplant packages that retailed for roughly 25000  the government banned the sale of organs effective march of 2008  since the ban took effect the number of transplants has decreased from 1046 in 2007 to 511 in 2010  professor roger lee mendoza has suggested that declining numbers of transplant tourists and documented organ sales may serve to strengthen organ black markets often he says banning organ sales fosters compensationbased contractual systems between underground donors brokers and buyers  according to the world health organization who illegal organ trade occurs when organs are removed from the body for the purpose of commercial transactions  the who has stated that payment fororgans is likely to take unfair advantage of the poorest and most vulnerable groups undermines altruistic donation and leads to profiteering and human trafficking  despite ordinances against organ sales it was estimated that in 2005 5 of all organ recipients had engaged in commercial organ transplants  research indicates that illegal organ trade is on the rise with a recent report by global financial integrity estimating that the illegal organ trade generates profits between 600 million and 12 billion per year with a span over many countries these countries include but are not limited to criminal networks increasingly engage in kidnappings especially of children and teenagers who are then taken to locations with medical equipment there they are murdered and their organs harvested for the illegal organ trade   poverty and loopholes in legislation also contribute to the illegal trade of organs  poverty is common in all countries with a large black market for organs as discussed above legislation containing loopholes like indias transplantation of human organs act allows organ sales to continue  likewise indias laws forbid monetary transactions for organs but do not regulate funds given to a spouse this provides another loophole for illegal trade in some cases an organ donor will marry the recipient to avoid a legal penalty  the international community and national governments have long attempted to find stable ethical systems to deal with the high demand for organ transplants in 1968 the united states implemented the uniform anatomical gift act of 1968 which gave individuals the right to donate their organs after their death later the us enacted the national organ transplant act of 1984 which established a national online registry for organ donors and prohibited organs from being bought or sold in the us the most recent efforts of the united states to combat high organ demand include the revision of the uniform anatomical gift act in 2006 and the 2007 charlie w norwood living organ donation act  many other countries have passed laws aimed at ending illegal organ trade for example south africa adopted the human tissue act of 1983 which outlaws the transfer of tissue including flesh bone organ or bodily fluid in exchange for payment  in may 2007 china adopted the human transplantation act banning organ commercialism  though claims of organ trafficking are difficult to substantiate due to lack of evidence and reliable data cases of illegal organ trade have been tried and prosecuted in the past it is estimated that 42 of transplanted organs come from illegal trafficking in organs  in 1993 bombay police exposed a kidney sale and transplantation operation run by a man known as santosh raut eleven people including raut and two nephrologists were arrested but raut managed to escape authorities believe that raut went on to establish similar illegal kidney centers across many indian cities in february 2008 another kidney transplant center run by a man called amit kumar was discovered by police in delhi and nearby gurgaon due to technological advances in fingerprinting kumar and raut are now believed to be the same perpetrator having gone by many aliases throughout years of illegal activity kumar is facing charges for his decades of involvement in illegal organ trade which includes over 600 illegal kidney transplants and the involvement of at least two hospitals  in 2007 a man in the united kingdom became the first person convicted under the human tissue act 2004 after he attempted to sell his kidney online for 24000 in order to pay off his gambling debts  in july 2009 levy izhak rosenbaum of brooklyn was arrested for conspiring to arrange the sale of an israeli citizens kidney to an undercover fbi officer for 160000  according to the charges against him rosenbaum said he had been involved in the illegal sale of kidneys for 10 years acting us attorney ralph marra said his business was to entice vulnerable people to give up a kidney for 10000 which he would turn around and sell for 160000 anthropologist and organ trade expert nancy scheperhughes stated that she had informed the fbi that rosenbaum was a major figure in international organ smuggling 7 years prior and that many of rosenbaums donors had come from eastern europe she also heard reports that rosenbaum held donors at gunpoint to ensure they donated their organs  rosenbaum pled guilty to organ trafficking in 2011 in november 2010 the south african national direct of public prosecution found st augustines hospital owned and operated by the private company netcare kwazulu pty limited guilty of 102 counts of activity relating to illegal kidney transplant operations convicted along with the private company were four transplant doctors a nephrologist two transplant administrative coordinators and a translator the charges against the parent company netcare and its ceo richard friedland were dropped in order to obtain an admission of guilt from the hospital the private company pled guilty to 109 illegal kidney operations performed on israeli romanian and brazilian citizens between june 2001 and november 2003 including five minors these citizens received cash following their surgeries while the private company was paid upfront for its involvement in the operations  in december 2010 turkish nationals were reported to be involved in organ trafficking in kosovo   in 2013 an international panel of judges from the european union rule of law mission in kosovo  convicted five people for illegal organ trade in 2014 an alleged member of the mexican knights templar cartel was arrested for kidnapping and murdering minors children were found wrapped in blankets and stuffed in a refrigerated container inside a van various accounts have stated the arrested man is part of a network that kidnaps and kills minors after which their organs are removed the cartels other sources of income include drug trafficking extortion illegal mining and illegal logging   there have been various portrayals of illegal organ trade and organ trafficking in the mass media over the past few decades the 1977 fictional novel coma by robin cook made into a movie by michael crichton tells of unsuspecting medical patients who are put into a coma in order for their organs to be removed similarly the 1993 book the baby train by jan brunvand reveals the mythical story of a man who wakes up in his hotel room with a missing kidney the night after flirting with a woman at a bar  in addition to books and films stories of organ trafficking are often depicted through television tabloid magazines emails and the internet  many of the organ trafficking tales depicted in the media contain unsubstantiated claims for example the 1993 britishcanadian tv program the body parts business made a number of claims about organ trafficking that later proved to be false the program investigated alleged organ and tissue trafficking in guatemala honduras argentina and russia one episode discussed a man named pedro reggi reporting that his corneas had been removed without his consent while he was hospitalized in a mental facility reggi later disputed this claim saying that his corneas were still intact and he had just been suffering from an acute eye infection  critics such as silke meyer argue that this sensationalized view of organ trafficking often depicted as an urban myth distracts attention from the illegal organ trade they call for increased scientific research on illegal organ trade so that organ trafficking legends can be replaced by scientific fact meyer argues only then will organ trafficking be taken seriously by all governments affected and will the results constitute a solid ground for the field of policymaking  in 2011 scott carney coined the term red market to describe a broad category of economic transactions related to the human body  he argues that advances in science have served to increase the demand for human body parts he writes that this increased demand has enabled a vast red market encompassing a wide variety of transactions from organ sale to organ thievery bone thievery blood farming and even rented space in womens wombs  drawing on the concepts of black markets white markets and gray markets carney suggests that commerce in body parts is distinct because bodies are not commodities in a strict sense that is a body part and its worth cannot be assigned a monetary value furthermore carney argues trade in body parts creates a lifelong debt between the provider and the recipient straight commerce in human bodies reduces a human life to its meat value carney calls for radical transparency in the red market supply chain in order to protect its humanness  according to the most recent bulletin of the world health organization on the state of the international organ trade 66000 kidney transplants 21000 liver transplants and 6000 heart transplants were performed globally in 2005  a 2008 article reported that the median waiting time for the united states transplant list was greater than 3 years with projections to increase in the next few years at the same time the united kingdom reported lacking organs for 8000 patients with the rate increasing at 8  the high demand for organs and long waitlists have been met with a corresponding expansion of the illegal organ trade currently it is estimated that about 10 of all transplants occur illegally with the internet acting as a facilitator  one source estimates that that at least 4000 prisoners were executed in 2006 to supply approximately 8000 kidneys and 3000 livers for foreign buyers  in 2007 2500 kidney transplants were purchased in pakistan with foreign recipients making up twothirds of the purchasers  as of 2007 the voluntary health association of india estimated that approximately 2000 indians sell a kidney every year in the same year in canada and the united kingdom experts estimated that about 30 to 50 patients illegally purchased organs abroad  the united network for organ sharing defines transplant tourism as the purchase of a transplant organ abroad that includes access to an organ while bypassing laws rules or processes of any or all countries involved  the term transplant tourism describes the commercialism that drives illegal organ trade but not all medical tourism for organs is illegal for example in some cases both the donor and the recipient of the organ travel to a country with adequate facilities to perform a legal surgery in other cases a recipient travels to receive the organ of a relative living abroad  transplant tourism raises concerns because it involves the transfer of healthy organs in one direction depleting the regions where organs are bought this transfer typically occurs in trends from south to north from developing to developed nations from females to males and from people of color to whites  trends that experts say have exacerbated olddivisions  the kidney is the most soughtafter organ in transplant tourism with prices for the organ ranging from as little as 1300  to as much as 150000  in fact reports estimate that 75 of all illegal organ trading involves kidneys  the liver trade is also prominent in transplant tourism with prices ranging from 4000  to 157000  though livers are regenerative making liver donations nonfatal they are much less common due to an excruciating postoperative recovery period that deters donors other highpriced bodily organs commonly sold in the organ trade include corneas 24400 and unfertilized eggs 12400 while lowerpriced bodily commodities include blood 25337 skin 10 per square inch and bonesligaments 5465  while there is a high demand and correspondingly a very high price for vital organs such as hearts and lungs transplant tourism and organ trafficking of these parts is very rare due to the sophisticated nature of the transplant surgery and the stateoftheart facilities required for such transplants  the international community has issued many ordinances and declarations against the organ trade examples include the world medical authoritys 1985 denouncement of organs for commercial use the council of europes convention on human rights and biomedicine of 1997 and its 2002 optional protocol concerning transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin and the declaration of istanbul on organ trafficking and transplant tourism  the world health organization who has played a prominent role in condemning the illegal organ trade the who first declared organ trade illegal in 1987 stating that such a trade violates the universal declaration of human rights  in 1991 at the 44th world health assembly it approved nine guiding principles for human organ transplant the principles clearly stated that organs cannot be the subject of financial transactions on may 22 2004 these guidelines were slightly amended at the 57th world health assembly they are intended for the use of governments worldwide  these global initiatives have served as a helpful resource for establishing medical professional codes and a legal framework for the issue but have not provided the sanctions required for enforcement  the declaration of istanbul on organ trafficking and transplant tourism drafted by the international transplant community defines transplant commercialism organ trafficking and transplant tourism  it denounces these practices based on violations to equity justice and human dignity  the declaration aims to promote ethical practices in organ transplantation and donation on an international level  it is nonbinding but over 100 transplant organizations support its principles including countries such as china israel the philippines and pakistan which strengthened their laws against illegal organ trading after the declarations release  data from the world health organization indicates that impoverished people in developing nations are the primary group targeted by the illegal organ trade in one study of organ donors in india 71 of all donors fell below the poverty line  tales of organ theft usually characterize the victims as unemployed males between the ages of 20 and 40 who were seeking work and were taken out of the country for operations  one such case involved makbuba aripova whose husband left uzbekistan for a job in canada his corpse and those of family members traveling with him were found several days later with missing organs and bags of money believed to be the proceeds from an organ sale  while men feature prominently in anecdotes on the organ trade impoverished women are also frequent victims  however most data show that women are rarely the recipients of purchased organs  one of the primary reasons donors articulate for why they sell their organs is to pay off debt  the most impoverished are frequently viewed as more reliable targets for transplant tourists because they are the most in need of money while some supporters of the organ trade argue that it helps lift some people out of poverty by providing compensation to donors evidence of this claim is hotly debated  in many cases people who sell their organs in order to pay off debt do not manage to escape this debt and remain trapped in debt cycles   often people do not make an informed choice to donate their kidneys to strangers but are forced into doing so due to extreme poverty   it is therefore problematic to establish informed consent when the decision to donate is economically motivated particularly in unregulated organ markets the donors socioeconomic situation is crucial in understanding the motives and outcomes of organ donation particularly in relation to economically disadvantaged organ donors in some cases organs are sold to family members either from parents to offspring or from adult children to parents this is more frequent in nations where waiting lists are less formal and among families which cannot afford to leave the country for transplants the trend of younger people donating to their more aged relatives is relatively new and has been criticized for placing greater value on kidneys from live donors  reports by the world health organization show decreased health and economic wellbeing for those who donate organs through transplant tourism in iran 58 of donors reported negative health consequences in egypt as many as 78 of donors experienced negative health outcomes and 96 of donors stated that they regretted donating  these findings are relatively consistent across all countries those who sell their organs on the market tend to have poorer overall health substandard conditions during transplant surgeries can also lead to transmission of diseases like hepatitis b hepatitis c and hiv donors poor health is further exacerbated by depression and other mental illnesses brought on by the stress of donating and insufficient care after surgery   impoverished donors economic outcomes are no better than their health outcomes a study of indian donors found that while 96 of donors sold a kidney to pay off debts 75 still had those operative care that is not provided by the buyer  a study of donors in iran the only nation that has legalized payment for organs found that 66 of donors reported lower financial status  donors in all countries often report weakness after surgery that leads to decreased employment opportunities especially for those who make a living through physical labor  the issue of organ trade both illegal and legal continues to be the subject of much debate from a wide range of scholars these debates have resulted in many proposed solutions addressing the high demand for organs and the rise in illicit trading these proposals have included a free market for organs increased legislative regulations and sanctions against illegal organ trading and implementation of presumed consent laws for organ donations  the wide range of academic perspectives on organ trade is discussed in the following sections according to a literature review of the 72 economic researchers who have studied organ trade 68 supported legalization of the organ trade while 21 opposed it  the criminal justice perspective considers organ trade from a legal judicial viewpoint though many statutes regarding organ trade exist law officials have failed to enforce these mandates successfully one barrier to enforcement is a lack of communication between medical authorities and law enforcement agencies often enforcement officials access to information regarding individuals involved in illegal organ transplants is hindered by medical confidentiality regulations without the ability to review medical records and histories to build an effective case against perpetrators officials cannot fully enforce organ trade laws  many critics state that in order to prohibit illegal organ trading effectively criminal justice agencies must collaborate with medical authorities to strengthen knowledge and enforcement of organ trade laws critics also support other criminal justice actions to meet this goal such as prioritizing organ trafficking issues among local legislative bodies multidisciplinary collaboration in crossborder offenses and further police training in dealing with organ trafficking crimes  the consensus of american economic association members is that organ trade should be legalized with 70 in favor and 16 opposed  in the journal of economic perspectives nobel laureate gary becker and julio elias estimated that a 15000 compensation would alleviate the shortage of kidney donors the government could pay the compensation to guarantee equality this would save public money as dialysis for kidney failure patients is far more expensive  many scholars advocate the implementation of a free market system to combat the organ shortage that helps drive illegal organ trade  the organ trades illegal status creates a price ceiling for organs at zero dollars this price ceiling affects supply and demand creating a shortage of organs in the face of a growing demand   according to a report published by the cato institute a usbased libertarian think tank eliminating the price ceiling would eliminate the organ shortage  however the idea of organ scarcity had been opposed by ivan illich and other authors who argue that scarcity is an artificially created need these critics argue that there is not an actual shortage of organs but rather a surplus of excess and wasted organs scarcity only exists for some groups of people those who are denied the organs and those who cannot afford them thus what needs to be regulated according to these authors is organ procurement and distribution practices  currently with little incentive to donate an organ approximately 6000 people die yearly waiting for a transplant organ david holberg has argued that regulating the organ trade could solve the organ shortage and create safer fair practices for donors  supporters of regulation argue that by implementing a regulated market system prices for organs would actually be lower than current black market values since an increased supply drives prices down these lowered organ prices could result in a disincentive to engage in black market organ trading since illegal brokers would have less to gain financially additionally the increased supply would result in shorter waiting periods for transplant recipients which would in turn reduce hospital costs  however other critics state that such a market would only increase already high prices for organs creating an imbalance only wealthy individuals would be able to purchase these organs they also argue that such a free market system for organ trade would encourage organ theft through murder and neglect of sick individuals for financial gain advocates for the free market of organs counter these claims by saying that murder for financial gain already happens sanctions against such acts exist to minimize their occurrence and with proper regulation and law enforcement such incidents in a legal organ trade could be minimized as well  the debate on the ethics and morality of organ trade remains spirited in modern society relevant evidence changes frequently due to the dynamic nature of our technological advancements in medicine and our understanding of ethics itself  at the moment although organ trade is illegal in almost all countries it is still difficult to provide a solid conclusion in the field of business ethics without a bias based on ones basic beliefs culture or religion particularly religion plays a major role in the topic of bodily autonomy as it relates to organ trade bodily autonomy is defined as the ability to make choices about how ones body is to be treated by others  many religious activists and theorists say this idea of bodily autonomy treats the body as property which violates many religious views that the body and self are one entity therefore from many religious stances selling a part of your body is analogous to selling your inner self or soul which many religious communities regard as a violation of human dignity  advocates for bodily autonomy argue that the freedom to make decisions about ones body does not violate ones dignity but actually increases a persons sense of control and empowerment by exercising their right to choose what to do with their body a person will be further empowered and effectively increase their bodily autonomy advocates argue that people regularly make choices about their body that carry risks analogous to the organ trade for example the right to endanger ones body by joining the military acting as a surrogate mother or engaging in medical experiments are all accepted in todays society  and are fueled by financial incentives by these standards advocates argue the right to choose whether to sell an organ should be supported  some researchers have said that legalization would allow state supervision of the organ trade and hence minimize medical dangers and exploitation  this could serve to protect donors who in the black market often receive inadequate and costly postoperative care  legalization of human organ trading has been opposed by a variety of human rights groups one such group is organs watch which was established by nancy scheperhughes  a medical anthropologist who was instrumental in exposing illegal international organselling rings scheperhughes is famous for her investigations that lead to several arrests due to thirdworld people being forced or fooled into organ donations  like the world health organization organs watch seeks to protect and benefit the povertystricken individuals who participate in the illegal organ trade out of necessity  however by 2010 scheperhughes and organ watch supported legal compensation for organ donations various solutions have been proposed to increase the number of legally available organs and stanch the flow of illegal trafficking around the globe policies of presumed consent have been successful in various countries including brazil the united states and several european nations these policies can be either optin or optout in a nation with an optout policy consent for organ donation is presumed upon death although one can choose not to donate by submitting documentation research shows a 2530 increase in the amount of available organs in optout countries  in nations with an optin policy like the united states or france a person may choose to donate their organs during their lifetime in optin countries families have on occasion succeeded in overturning the deceaseds decision to donate presumed consent programs cut down on organ trafficking in many ways these laws help increase the amount of available organs decreasing patients reliance on the black market at the same time the increased supply of organs decreases the financial cost of a transplant lessening the need for medical tourism  another proposed method is to enact laws that would hold doctors accountable for not reporting suspected organ trafficking scheperhughes has written extensively on the issue of doctors knowingly performing illegal operations with illicit organs  she argues that though doctors would be violating doctorpatient privilege their legal obligation to the patient is superseded by public interest in ending alleged medical violations of human rights if accountability measures were imposed doctors would be liable as accomplices if they knowingly performed operations with black market organs  many people in the united states believe that adopting a system for regulating organ trading similar to irans will help to decrease national the shortage of kidneys they argue that the us could adopt similar policies to promote accountability ensure safety in surgical practices employ vendor registries and provide donors with lifetime care they further argue that private insurance companies would be invested in providing such care for donors and that laws could be enacted to make longterm care an inviolable condition of any donation agreement

V a visual prosthesis often referred to as a bionic eye is an experimental visual device intended to restore functional vision in those suffering from partial or total blindness in 1983 joao lobo antunes a portuguese doctor implanted a bionic eye in a person born blind many devices have been developed usually modeled on the cochlear implant or bionic ear devices a type of neural prosthesis in use since the mid1980s the idea of using electrical current eg electrically stimulating the retina or the visual cortex to provide sight dates back to the 18th century discussed by benjamin franklin  tiberius cavallo  and charles leroy    the ability to give sight to a blind person via a bionic eye depends on the circumstances surrounding the loss of sight for retinal prostheses which are the most prevalent visual prosthetic under development due to ease of access to the retina among other considerations patients with vision loss due to degeneration of photoreceptors retinitis pigmentosa choroideremia geographic atrophy macular degeneration are the best candidate for treatment candidates for visual prosthetic implants find the procedure most successful if the optic nerve was developed prior to the onset of blindness persons born with blindness may lack a fully developed optical nerve which typically develops prior to birth  though neuroplasticity makes it possible for the nerve and sight to develop after implantation  visual prosthetics are being developed as a potentially valuable aid for individuals with visual degradation argus ii codeveloped at the university of southern california usc eye institute   and manufactured by second sight medical products inc is not the only such device to have received marketing approval ce mark in europe in 2011 most other efforts remain investigational the retina implant ags alpha ims won a ce mark july 2013 and is a significant improvement in resolution it is not however fda approved in the usa  dr mark humayun who joined the faculty of the keck school of medicine of usc department of ophthalmology in 2001  dr eugene dejuan now at the university of california san francisco engineer howard d phillips bioelectronics engineer dr wentai liu now at university of california los angeles and dr robert greenberg now of second sight were the original inventors of the active epiretinal prosthesis  and demonstrated proof of principle in acute patient investigations at johns hopkins university in the early 1990s in the late 1990s the company second sight  was formed by dr greenberg along with medical device entrepreneur alfred e mann   their firstgeneration implant had 16 electrodes and was implanted in six subjects by humayun at university of southern california between 2002 and 2004    in 2007 the company began a trial of its secondgeneration 60electrode implant dubbed the argus ii in the us and in europe   in total 30 subjects participated in the studies spanning 10 sites in four countries in the spring of 2011 based on the results of the clinical study which were published in 2012  argus ii was approved for commercial use in europe and second sight launched the product later that same year the argus ii was approved by the united states fda on 14 february 2013 three major us government funding agencies national eye institute department of energy and national science foundation have supported the work at second sight usc ucsc caltech and other research labs  designed by claude veraart at the university of louvain this is a spiral cuff electrode around the optic nerve at the back of the eye it is connected to a stimulator implanted in a small depression in the skull the stimulator receives signals from an externally worn camera which are translated into electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve directly  although not truly an active prosthesis an implantable miniature telescope is one type of visual implant that has met with some success in the treatment of endstage agerelated macular degeneration    this type of device is implanted in the eyes posterior chamber and works by increasing by about three times the size of the image projected onto the retina in order to overcome a centrally located scotoma or blind spot   created by visioncare ophthalmic technologies in conjunction with the centrasight treatment program the telescope is about the size of a pea and is implanted behind the iris of one eye images are projected onto healthy areas of the central retina outside the degenerated macula and is enlarged to reduce the effect the blind spot has on central vision 22x or 27x magnification strengths make it possible to see or discern the central vision object of interest while the other eye is used for peripheral vision because the eye that has the implant will have limited peripheral vision as a side effect unlike a telescope which would be handheld the implant moves with the eye which is the main advantage patients using the device may however still need glasses for optimal vision and for close work before surgery patients should first try out a handheld telescope to see if they would benefit from image enlargement one of the main drawbacks is that it cannot be used for patients who have had cataract surgery as the intraocular lens would obstruct insertion of the telescope it also requires a large incision in the cornea to insert  a southern german team led by the university eye hospital in tübingen was formed in 1995 by eberhart zrenner to develop a subretinal prosthesis the chip is located behind the retina and utilizes microphotodiode arrays mpda which collect incident light and transform it into electrical current stimulating the retinal ganglion cells as natural photoreceptors are far more efficient than photodiodes visible light is not powerful enough to stimulate the mpda therefore an external power supply is used to enhance the stimulation current the german team commenced in vivo experiments in 2000 when evoked cortical potentials were measured from yucatán micropigs and rabbits at 14 months post implantation the implant and retina surrounding it were examined and there were no noticeable changes to anatomical integrity the implants were successful in producing evoked cortical potentials in half of the animals tested the thresholds identified in this study were similar to those required in epiretinal stimulation the latest reports from this group concern the results of a clinical pilot study on 11 participants suffering from rp some blind patients were able to read letters recognize unknown objects localize a plate a cup and cutlery the results were to be presented in detail in 2011 in the proceeedings of the royal society b doi101098rspb20101747 in 2010 a new multicenter study has been started using a fully implantable device with 1500 electrodes alpha ims produced by retina implant ag reutlingen germany 10 patients included so far first results have been presented at arvo 2011 the first uk implantations took place in march 2012 and were led by professor robert maclaren at the university of oxford and mr tim jackson at kings college hospital in london   professor david wong also implanted the tübingen device in a patient in hongkong  in all cases previously blind patients had some degree of sight restored confirming that despite the complexity of surgery the device can be implanted successfully at other specialist centers around the world joseph rizzo and john wyatt at the massachusetts eye and ear infirmary and mit began researching the feasibility of a retinal prosthesis in 1989 and performed a number of proofofconcept epiretinal stimulation trials on blind volunteers between 1998 and 2000 they have since developed a subretinal stimulator an array of electrodes that is placed beneath the retina in the subretinal space and receives image signals beamed from a camera mounted on a pair of glasses the stimulator chip decodes the picture information beamed from the camera and stimulates retinal ganglion cells accordingly their second generation prosthesis collects data and sends it to the implant through rf fields from transmitter coils that are mounted on the glasses a secondary receiver coil is sutured around the iris  the brothers alan chow and vincent chow have developed a microchip containing 3500 photo diodes which detect light and convert it into electrical impulses which stimulate healthy retinal ganglion cells the asr requires no externally worn devices  the original optobionics corp stopped operations but dr chow acquired the optobionics name the asr implants and will be reorganizing a new company under the same name the asr microchip is a 2mm in diameter silicon chip same concept as computer chips containing 5000 microscopic solar cells called microphotodiodes that each have their own stimulating electrode  daniel palanker and his group at stanford university have developed a photovoltaic system for visual prosthesis  that includes a subretinal photodiode array and an infrared image projection system mounted on video goggles information from the video camera is processed in a pocket pc and displayed on pulsed nearinfrared ir 850915nm video goggles ir image is projected onto the retina via natural eye optics and activates photodiodes in the subretinal implant that convert light into pulsed biphasic electric current in each pixel  charge injection can be further increased using a common bias voltage provided by a radiofrequencydriven implantable power supply  proximity between electrodes and neural cells necessary for high resolution stimulation can be achieved utilizing the effect of retinal migration an australian team led by professor anthony burkitt is developing two retinal prostheses the wideview device combines novel technologies with materials that have been successfully used in other clinical implants this approach incorporates a microchip with 98 stimulating electrodes and aims to provide increased mobility for patients to help them move safely in their environment this implant will be placed in the suprachoroidal space researchers expect the first patient tests to begin with this device in 2013 the bionic vision australia consortium is concurrently developing the highacuity device which incorporates a number of new technologies to bring together a microchip and an implant with 1024 electrodes the device aims to provide functional central vision to assist with tasks such as face recognition and reading large print this highacuity implant will be inserted epiretinally patient tests are planned for this device in 2014 once preclinical testing has been completed patients with retinitis pigmentosa will be the first to participate in the studies followed by agerelated macular degeneration each prototype consists of a camera attached to a pair of glasses which sends the signal to the implanted microchip where it is converted into electrical impulses to stimulate the remaining healthy neurons in the retina this information is then passed on to the optic nerve and the vision processing centres of the brain the australian research council awarded bionic vision australia a 42 million grant in december 2009 and the consortium was officially launched in march 2010 bionic vision australia brings together a multidisciplinary team many of whom have extensive experience developing medical devices such as the cochlear implant or bionic ear  similar in function to the harvardmit device except the stimulator chip sits in the primary visual cortex rather than on the retina many subjects have been implanted with a high success rate and limited negative effects still in the developmental phase upon the death of dr dobelle selling the eye for profit was ruled against in favor of donating it to a publicly funded research team   the laboratory of neural prosthetics at illinois institute of technology iit chicago is developing a visual prosthetic using intracortical electrode arrays while similar in principle to the dobelle system the use of intracortical electrodes allow for greatly increased spatial resolution in the stimulation signals more electrodes per unit area in addition a wireless telemetry system is being developed  to eliminate the need for transcranial wires arrays of activated iridium oxide film airofcoated electrodes will be implanted in the visual cortex located on the occipital lobe of the brain external hardware will capture images process them and generate instructions which will then be transmitted to implanted circuitry via a telemetry link the circuitry will decode the instructions and stimulate the electrodes in turn stimulating the visual cortex the group is developing a wearable external image capture and processing system to accompany the implanted circuitry studies on animals and psyphophysical studies on humans are being conducted  to test the feasibility of a human volunteer implant this is a laserbased system for projecting an image directly onto the retina this could be useful for enhancing normal vision or bypassing an occlusion such as a cataract or a damaged cornea  dr mohamad sawan professor and researcher at polystim neurotechnologies laboratory at the ecole polytechnique de montreal has been working on a visual prosthesis to be implanted into the visual cortex the basic principle of dr sawans technology consists of stimulating the visual cortex by implanting a silicon microchip on a network of electrodes made of biocompatible materials wherein each electrode injects a stimulating electrical current in order to provoke a series of luminous points to appear an array of pixels in the field of vision of the blind person this system is composed of two distinct parts the implant and an external controller the implant is lodged in the visual cortex and wirelessly receives data and energy from the external controller it contains all the circuits necessary to generate the electrical stimuli and to monitor the changing microelectrodebiological tissue interface the batteryoperated outer controller consists of a microcamera which captures images as well as a processor and a command generator which process the imaging data to translate the captured images and generate and manage the electrical stimulation process the external controller and the implant exchange data in both directions by a transcutaneous radio frequency rf link which also powers the implant  sheila nirenberg as director of her laboratory team at weill cornell medical college has found a method of treating retinal degeneration by using a deciphering of the retinal code combined with optogenetics work on the genetic engineering therapy for human trials is underway now in the stage of working with mice and monkeys but meanwhile nirenberg is working with retinal prosthesis maker second sight in sylmar california to

V the heart shape  is an ideograph used to express the idea of the heart in its metaphorical or symbolic sense as the center of emotion including affection and love especially but not exclusively romantic love the wounded heart indicating love sickness came to be depicted as a heart symbol pierced with an arrow cupids or heart symbol broken in two or more pieces   the combination of the heart shape and its use within the heart metaphor developed at the end of the middle ages with possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century the familiar symbol of the heart representing love developed in the 15th century and became widely popular in the 16th  before the 14th century the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor the geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources but in such instances does not depict a heart but typically foliage in examples from antiquity fig leaves and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of ivy and of the waterlily the first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s it occurs in a miniature decorating a capital s in a manuscript of the french roman de la poire national library fr ms 2086 plate 12 in the miniature a kneeling lover or more precisely an allegory of the lovers sweet gaze or douz regart offers his heart to a damsel the heart here resembles a pinecone held upsidedown the point facing downward in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions  giotto in his 1305 painting in the scrovegni chapel padua shows an allegory of charity handing her heart to christ and this heart is depicted in the pinecone shape based on anatomical descriptions still held upsidedown giottos painting exerted considerable influence on later painters and the motive of caritas offering a heart is shown by taddeo gaddi in santa croce by andrea pisano on the bronze door of the south porch of the baptisterium in florence c 1337 by ambrogio lorenzetti in the palazzo publico in sienna c 1340 and by andrea da firenze in santa maria novella in florence c 1365 the convention of showing the heart pointupward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century  the scalloped shape of the nowfamiliar heart symbol with a dent in its base first arises in the early 14th century at first only lightly dented as in the miniatures in francesco barberinos documenti damore before 1320 a slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the cistercian monastery in brussels ms 445970 fol 192v royal library of belgium the convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward  the modern indented red heart has been used on playing cards since the late 15th century  various hypotheses attempted to connect the heart shape as it evolved in the late medieval period with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity  such theories are modern proposed from the 1960s onward and they remain speculative as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown specific suggestions include the shape of the seed of the silphium plant used in ancient times as an herbal contraceptive   and stylized depictions of features of the human female body such as the females buttocks pubic mound or spread vulva  hearts can be seen on the bible jesus holds in the empress zoe mosaic in the hagia sophia in istanbul it probably dates from 1239 hearts can also be seen on various stucco reliefs and wall panels excavated from the ruins of ctesiphon the persian capital circa 90 bc  637 ad    the luther rose was the seal that was designed for martin luther at the behest of prince john frederick in 1530 while luther was staying at the coburg fortress during the diet of augsburg luther wrote an explanation of the symbol to lazarus spengler a black cross in a heart which retains its natural color so that i myself would be reminded that faith in the crucified saves us for one who believes from the heart will be justified romans 1010  the aorta remains visible as a protrusion at the top centered between the two chambers indicated in the symbol in some depictions of the sacred heart well into the 18th century and is partly still shown today although mostly obscured by elements such as a crown flames rays or a cross but the hearts suit did not have this element since the 15th century the heart symbol reached japan with the nanban trade of 1543 to 1614 as evidenced by an edo period samurai helmet dated c 1630 which includes both the rounded and indented forms of the heart symbol representing the heart of marishiten goddess of archers  the chanson belle bonne sage by baude cordier written in the shape of a heart in the chantilly codex this is one of two dedicatory pieces placed at the beginning of the older late 14th century corpus probably to replace the original first fascicle which is missing early depiction of the heart of jesus in the context of the five wounds the wounded heart here depicting

with the crucifix placed inside the aorta another anatomically correct sacred heart painted in c 1770 by josé de páez since the 19th century the symbol has often been used on st valentines day cards candy boxes and similar popular culture artifacts as a symbol of romantic love the use of the heart symbol as a logograph for the english verb to love derives from the use in i  ny introduced in 1977  heart symbols were used to symbolize health or lives in video games influentially so in the legend of zelda 1986 super mario bros 2 1987 1988 did have a life bar composed of hexagons but in 1990s remakes of these games the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes since the 1990s the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context eg used by restaurants to indicate hearthealthy nutrient content claim eg low in cholesterol a copyrighted heartcheck symbol to indicate healthy food was introduced by the american heart association in 1995  a heartshaped map of womans heart 1830s two burning hearts coloured pink illustration on a victorianera valentines day card a vinegar valentine card from the 1870s with a red heart symbol pierced by six arrows the traditional heart shape appears on a 1910 valentines day card sheet music cover of look in his eyes from the musical have a heart 1913 the earliest heartshaped charges in heraldry appear in the 12th century the hearts in the coat of arms of denmark go back to the royal banner of the kings of denmark in turn based on a seal used as early as the 1190s however while the charges are clearly heartshaped they did not in origin depict hearts or symbolize any idea related to love instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the waterlily early heraldic heartshaped charges depicting the leaves of waterlilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline eg flags of frisia inverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized testicles coglioni in italian as in the canting arms of the colleoni family of milan  a seal attributed to william lord of douglas of 1333 shows a heart shape identified as the heart of robert the bruce the authenticity of this seal is very questionable  ie it could possibly date to the late 14th or the 15th century  heraldic charges actually representing hearts become more common in the early modern period with the sacred heart depicted in ecclesiastical heraldry and hearts representing love in bourgeois coats of arms hearts later also become popular elements in municipal coats of arms royal banner of the kings of denmark 12th or 13th century coat of arms of the principality of lüneburg originating with william of winchester lord of lüneburg d 1213 who married helena

for the heart is 3 in unicode several heart symbols are available and from the miscellaneous symbols and pictographs range associated with emoji in code page 437 the original character set of the ibm pc the value of 3 hexadecimal 03 represents the heart symbol this value is shared with the nonprinting etx control character which overrides the glyph in many contexts the unicode character of the letter ghan of the georgian alphabet \u10e6 has seen some use as a surrogate heart symbol in online communication   a number of parametrisations of approximately heartshaped curves have been described the bestknown of these is the cardioid which is an epicycloid with one cusp  however since this lacks the point it may rather be seen as a stylized waterlily leaf a socalled seeblatt other curves such as the implicit curve x y 1 x y 0 may produce better approximations of the heart shape  heart curve on ti89 graphics calculator parametric equation of heart curve on ti89 graphics calculator

V cleavage is the area between a womans breasts lying over the sternum and normally refers to what is visible with clothing that includes a lowcut neckline in some cultures display of cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic and may be associated with garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage such as ball gowns evening gowns lingerie and swimwear in these cultures women have throughout history sought to enhance their physical attractiveness and femininity within the context of changing fashions and culturalspecific norms of modesty of the time and place the methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts including cleavage in some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally taboo illegal or otherwise socially disapproved   the anatomical term for the area that constitutes a cleavage is intermammary cleft intermammary sulcus or sulcus intermammarius décolletage is the upper part of a womans torso between her waist and neck comprising her neck shoulders back and chest that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing however the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage  when the side of the breasts are uncovered it is known as side cleavage sidewinders or sideboob   in early 2010s side cleavage was identified as a fashion trend gabriele hackworthy fashion director at harpers bazaar said the look is unlikely to fade fast with yves saint laurent and roberto cavalli both pushing the silhouette next season   many people in western culture both male and female consider breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic  and an important aspect of femininity and many women use décolletage that exposes cleavage as part of their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a womans cleavage  and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage when cleavage is enhanced with a pushup bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention  during adolescence some girls become obsessed with breast shape and cleavage  in south africa wonderbra sponsors a national cleavage day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage  the use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage has been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism and atypical paraphilia  in western and some other societies there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public  in contemporary western society the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by dress codes in some settings such as workplaces churches and schools while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged the exposure of nipples or areolae is almost always considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as lewd or indecent behavior  art historian james laver argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the western world  there is historical evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or any hint of a bosom  early english puritans used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely while 17th century spaniards put lead plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing  in the quran the holy book of islam it is explicitly stated let them draw their khimar shawlhead veil over their juyub breastlinecleavage  the ayat refers to the womens clothes worn parted in the front to expose the breasts at the time when it was cited     it was later interpreted as total covering of a womans body    in early 21st century muslim world there are differences in legal implementation in saudi arabia and afghanistan women are required to cover their body and face completely  iranian law requires a chador overcloak or a hijab head scarf  in egypt the exposure of cleavage in the media is considered to be nudity  the cleavage area between the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest breast and buttock cleavages sharing a similarity between their appearances are considered to be very sexual  british zoologist and ethologist desmond morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks  swelling of the anterior is a sign of matingreadiness in ape species among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks but the breasts are significantly enlarged theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary change measure of matingreadiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage  evolutionary psychologists theorize that humans permanently enlarged breasts in contrast to other primates breasts which only enlarge during ovulation allowed females to solicit male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile  though morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward reversing breast augmentations   according to social historian david kunzle waist confinement and décolletage are the primary sexualization devices of western costume  by the turn of the 21st century some of the attention given to cleavage and breasts started to shift to buttocks especially in the media   in 2600 bce princess nofret of the fourth dynasty of egypt was depicted in a vneck gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage in 1600 bce snake goddess figurines were sculpted in minos with open dressfronts revealing entire breasts  ancient greek goddess hera wore an early version of a pushup bra described in the iliad as festooned with brooches of gold and a hundred tassels to increase her cleavage to divert zeus from the trojan war  décolletage was often a feature of the dress of the late middle ages this continued through the victorian period gowns that exposed a womans neck and top of her chest were very common and uncontroversial in europe from at least the 11th century until the victorian period in the 19th century ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage   in the 14th century necklines were lowered clothes were tightened and breasts were once again flaunted it was during the renaissance period that the corset was born breasts were pushed up pushed together and molded into firm protruding decorations that emphasized breasts to the maximum  in 1450 agnès sorel mistress to charles vii of france is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the french court  other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included simonetta vespucci whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by piero di cosimo in c1480 in many european societies between the renaissance and the 19th century wearing lowcut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than today with a womans bared legs ankles or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts  in aristocratic and upperclass circles the display of breasts was at times regarded as a status symbol as a sign of beauty wealth or social position  the bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of classical greece that were exerting an influence on art sculpture and architecture of the period  after the french revolution décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back  during the 16th century womens fashions with exposed breasts were common in society from queens to common prostitutes and emulated by all classes  anne of brittany has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline low square décolleté styles were popular in england in the 17th century and even queen mary ii and henrietta maria wife of charles i of england were depicted with fully bared breasts and architect inigo jones designed a masque costume for henrietta maria that fully revealed both of her breasts   during the fashions of the period 17951820 many women wore dresses that bared necks bosoms and shoulders anne of austria was known for wearing along with female members of her court very tight bodice and corsets that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the aereola and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it  the wearing of lowcut dresses that exposed breasts was considered more acceptable than it is todaywith a womans bared legs ankles or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts  low cut dresses that exposed a womans neck and top of her chest were very common across europe until the victorian period though a womans bared legs ankles and shoulders were considered more risqué  during the victorian period social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public for ordinary wear high collars were the norm towards the end of the victorian period end 19th century the full collar was the fashion though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions see 1880s in fashion during the french enlightenment there was a debate as to whether a womans breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child in alexandre guillaume mouslier de moissys 1771 play the true mother la vraie mère the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts  the respectable treasures of nature  as merely an embellishment destined to ornament the chest of women  nearly a century later also in france a man from the provinces who attended a court ball at the tuileries in paris in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust i havent seen anything like that since i was weaned  in 1884 portrait of madame x a portrait painting by john singer sargent of americanborn paris socialite virginie amélie avegno gautreau was criticized  for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder the controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder and sargent left paris for london in 1884   in 1908 a single pad made of rubber or a bust form was advertised that was to be worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable  clergymen all over the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or vshaped necklines became fashionable around 1913 in the german empire for example all roman catholic bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions  fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage while exposure of the leg became more accepted in western societies during world war i and remained so for nearly half a century  in 1953 hollywood film the french line was found objectionable under the hays code because of jane russells breast shots in bathtub cleavage and breast exposure while some of her décollete gowns were thought intentionally designed to give a bosom peepshow effect beyond even extreme decolletage  but other actresses defied the then standards for example gina lollobrigida raised eyebrows with her famous lowcut dress in 1960 and other celebrities performers and models followed suit and the public was not far behind lowcut styles of various depths are now common in many situations during the 1950s hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines and falsies in the late 1960s erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower torso reasserting the need to diet especially as new clothing fashions  brief sheer and close fitting  prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of beauty  from the 1960s onward however changes in fashions were towards increasing displays of cleavage in films and television with jane russell and elizabeth taylor being the biggest stars who led the fashion  and in everyday life lowcut dress styles became very common even for casual wear  during a short period in 1964 topless dress designs appeared at fashion shows but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges  the wonderbra was created in 1964 by louise poirier for canadelle a canadian lingerie company it had 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and pushtogether effect firstyear sales for the wonderbra later repositioned wonderbra as a romantic fashionable and sexy brand  were approximated at us120 million  the ideal of breasts and cleavage has also evolved in the later half of 20th century with shapes enhanced by use of a variety of methods and techniques in the 1950s the preferred shape was pointy echoing the scifi look of the times in 1960s it was elegantly sloped in alignment with hippie chic of the times and from 1990s buffed pumped and engorged look has become the preference  display of cleavage can still be controversial in the united states in two separate incidents in 2007 southwest airlines crews asked travelers to modify their clothing to wear sweaters or to leave the airplane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable  in langley british columbia a young woman was sent home from her high school for wearing a top that her principal deemed inappropriate because it showed too much cleavage    german chancellor angela merkel created controversy when she wore a lowcut evening gown to the opening of the oslo opera house in 2008   us senator hillary clinton and british home secretary jacqui smith drew attention for wearing lowcut blouses that revealed a small amount of cleavage resulting in comments in the washington post and the new york times   vera lengsfeld the conservative christian democratic union candidate for berlins friedrichshainkreuzberg district used pictures of herself and german chancellor angela merkel in lowcut dresses during her political campaign facing a tough campaign she posted 750 provocative campaign posters accompanied by the slogan we have more to offer to draw attention to serious election issues the posters had a positive impact  various methods have been used by women in history to enhance their physical attractiveness and femininity including the accentuation and display of breasts within the context of fashions and norms of modesty of the time and place corsets that enhanced cleavage were introduced in the mid16th century  by the late 18th century cleavageenhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward  the tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage   when corsets became unfashionable brassieres and padding helped to project display and emphasize the breasts in 1893 new yorker marie tucek was granted a patent for a breast supporter described as a modification of the corset and was very similar to a modern pushup bra designed to support the breasts it consisted of a plate made of metal cardboard or other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts following the contour of the breasts it was covered with silk canvas or other cloth which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast the plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits   development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s  though it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s when the end of world war ii freed metal for domestic use   aviator and filmmaker howard hughes designed a prototype for an aerodynamic underwire bra for jane russell when filming the outlaw in 1941 according to hughes the resultant amount was the length of the actual cleavage is five and onequarter inches  several brassiere manufacturers among them wonderbra and victorias secret produce pushup and other types of bras that enhance cleavage fredericks of hollywood introduced a design called hollywood extreme cleavage bra that helped give the impression of a spherical cleavage like augmented breasts that was popularized by stars like pamela anderson  many women such as beauty pageant participants and transgender people create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast bending forward tightly pulling them together and up    types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape some also use a strip of moleskin under the breasts with tape at the ends to hold it in place use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes blisters and skin being torn off   bigger breasts are easier to push together to accent the hollow between them  some flatchested women feel selfconscious about their small breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking breast augmentation  plastic surgeon gerard h pitman says you cant have cleavage with an a cup you have to be at least a b or a c  the average breast size has grown from a 34b to a 36c since the 1970s and clothing styles are smaller and snugger  a similar statement was made for nonsurgical cleavage enhancement as well ie lingerie manufacturers fredericks of hollywood promises highrise cleavage to small busts and curvees in etam claims to give girls with a b cup an exciting c cup cleavage  breast surgery for emplacing breast implants can be done for three purposes for breast reconstruction and for the augmentation and enhancement of the aesthetics  size shape and texture  of a womans breasts there are two types of breast implant devices in practice saline implants filled with sterile saline solution and silicone implants filled with viscous silicone gel if a surgeon attempts to create or increase cleavage by loosening the medial borders of the breasts it could result in symmastia a confluence of the breast tissue of both breasts across the midline anterior to the sternum creating a lack of defined cleavage   procedures are generally followed during breast reconstruction to preserve a natural cleavage of breasts   regular exercise of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast helps prevent droopiness can create the illusion of larger and firmer breasts and an enhanced cleavage    weight training use of exercise machines push ups and chest presses are considered helpful as well as a number of other exercises including rowing and basketball  in some form of exercise breasts unsupported by a sports bra are exposed to greater risk of droopiness   making cleavage appear deeper and the breasts look fuller alongside the cleavage with makeup is achieved using shading effects the middle of the cleavage is made to look deeper by using a darker makeup colour than the base colour of the skin while the most prominent areas of the breasts either side of the cleavage are made to look larger or more protruding by the use of a paler colour

V the supraorbital gland is a type of lateral nasal gland found in some species of marine birds particularly penguins which removes sodium chloride from the bloodstream the glands function is similar to that of the kidneys though it is much more efficient at removing salt allowing penguins to survive without access to fresh water contrary to popular belief the gland does not directly convert saltwater to freshwater the term supraorbital refers to the area just above the eye socket which is known as the orbit of the eye living in saltwater environments would naturally pose a large problem for penguins because the ingestion of saltwater would be detrimental to a penguins health although penguins do not directly drink water it is taken in when they engulf prey as a result saltwater enters their system and must be effectively excreted the supraorbital gland has thus enabled the penguins survival in such environments due to its waterfiltering capability the gland is located just above the eyes and surrounds a capillary bed in the head this capillary bed constantly strains out the salt in the saltwater that a penguin takes in since the byproduct of the gland has roughly five times as much salt as would normally be found in the animals fluids the supraorbital gland is highly efficient the penguin excretes the salt byproduct as a brine through its bill often the fluid drips out and this gives the appearance of a runny nose however the fluid may also be sneezed out in the absence of saltwater caused by captivity the supraorbital gland will lie dormant as it has no other purpose having a dormant supraorbital gland does not negatively affect the health of a penguin

V this is a draft articles for creation submission it is not currently pending review there are no deadlines as long as you are actively improving the submission drafts not being improved may be deleted after six months  you may also wish to look at  there are many different ways to classify neurotransmitters dividing them into amino acids peptides and monoamines is sufficient for some classification purposes major neurotransmitters in addition over 50 neuroactive peptides have been found and new ones are discovered regularly many of these are coreleased along with a smallmolecule transmitter nevertheless in some cases a peptide is the primary transmitter at a synapse \u03b2endorphin is a relatively well known example of a peptide neurotransmitter because it engages in highly specific interactions with opioid receptors in the central nervous system single ions such as synaptically released zinc are also considered neurotransmitters by some  as well as some gaseous molecules such as nitric oxide no carbon monoxide co and hydrogen sulfide h2s  the gases are produced in the neural cytoplasm and are immediately diffused through the cell membrane into the extracellular fluid and into nearby cells to stimulate production of second messengers soluble gas neurotransmitters are difficult to study as they act rapidly and are immediately broken down existing for only a few seconds the most prevalent transmitter is glutamate which is excitatory at well over 90 of the synapses in the human brain  the next most prevalent is gammaaminobutyric acid or gaba which is inhibitory at more than 90 of the synapses that do not use glutamate although other transmitters are used in fewer synapses they may be very important functionally the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering the actions of some neurotransmitter systems often acting through transmitters other than glutamate or gaba addictive drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines exert their effects primarily on the dopamine system the addictive opiate drugs exert their effects primarily as functional analogs of opioid peptides which in turn regulate dopamine levels the human brain is the main organ of the human central nervous system it is located in the head protected by the skull it has the same general structure as the brains of other mammals but with a more developed cerebral cortex large animals such as whales and elephants have larger brains in absolute terms but when measured using a measure of relative brain size which compensates for body size the quotient for the human brain is almost twice as large as that of a bottlenose dolphin and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee though the quotient for a treeshrew brain is larger than that of a humans  much of the size of the human brain comes from the cerebral cortex especially the frontal lobes which are associated with executive functions such as selfcontrol planning reasoning and abstract thought the area of the cerebral cortex devoted to vision the visual cortex is also greatly enlarged in humans compared to other animals the human cerebral cortex is a thick layer of neural tissue that covers most of the brain this layer is folded in a way that increases the amount of surface area that can fit into the volume available the pattern of folds is similar across individuals but shows many small variations the cortex is divided into four lobes  the frontal lobe parietal lobe temporal lobe and occipital lobe some classification systems also include a limbic lobe and treat the insular cortex as a lobe within each lobe are numerous cortical areas each associated with a particular function including vision motor control and language the left and right sides of the cortex are broadly similar in shape and most cortical areas are replicated on both sides some areas though show strong lateralization particularly areas that are involved in language in most people the left hemisphere is dominant for language with the right hemisphere playing only a minor role there are other functions such as visualspatial ability for which the right hemisphere is usually dominant despite being protected by the thick bones of the skull suspended in cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from the bloodstream by the bloodbrain barrier the human brain is susceptible to damage and disease the most common forms of physical damage are closed head injuries such as a blow to the head a stroke or poisoning by a variety of chemicals which can act as neurotoxins such as ethanol alcohol infection of the brain though serious is rare because of the biological barriers which protect it the human brain is also susceptible to degenerative disorders such as parkinsons disease and alzheimers disease mostly as the result of aging and multiple sclerosis a number of psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and clinical depression are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions although the nature of these is not well understood the brain can also be the site of brain tumors and these can be benign or malignant there are some techniques for studying the brain that are used in other animals that are just not suitable for use in humans and vice versa it is easier to obtain individual brain cells taken from other animals for study it is also possible to use invasive techniques in other animals such as inserting electrodes into the brain or disabling certains parts of the brain in order to examine the effects on behaviour  techniques that are not possible to be used in humans however only humans can respond to complex verbal instructions or be of use in the study of important brain functions such as language and other complex cognitive tasks but studies from humans and from other animals can be of mutual help medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and eeg recordings are important techniques in studying the brain the complete functional understanding of the human brain is an ongoing challenge for neuroscience the adult human brain weighs on average about 1315kg 2933lb or about 2 of total body weight   with a volume of around 1130 cubic centimetres cm  in women and 1260cm  in men although there is substantial individual variation  neurological differences between the sexes have not been shown to correlate in any simple way with iq or other measures of cognitive performance  the human brain is composed of neurons glial cells and blood vessels the number of neurons according to array tomography has been shown to be on average about 86 billion in the adult human brain with a roughly equal number about 84 billion of nonneuronal cells  out of these 16 billion or 19 of all brain neurons are located in the cerebral cortex including subcortical white matter 69 billion or 80 of all brain neurons are in the cerebellum and fewer than 1 of all brain neurons are located in the rest of the brain  the cerebral hemispheres the cerebrum form the largest part of the human brain and are situated above other brain structures they are covered with a cortical layer the cerebral cortex which has a convoluted topography  underneath the cerebrum lies the brainstem resembling a stalk on which the cerebrum is attached at the rear of the brain beneath the cerebrum and behind the brainstem is the cerebellum a structure with a horizontally furrowed surface the cerebellar cortex that makes it look different from any other brain area the same structures are present in other mammals although they vary considerably in relative size as a rule the smaller the cerebrum the less convoluted the cortex the cortex of a rat or mouse is almost perfectly smooth the cortex of a dolphin or whale on the other hand is more convoluted than the cortex of a human the living brain is very soft having a gellike consistency similar to soft tofu although referred to as grey matter the live cortex is pinkishbeige in color and slightly offwhite in the interior the human brain has many properties that are common to all vertebrate brains including a basic division into three parts called the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain with interconnected fluidfilled ventricles and a set of generic vertebrate brain structures including the medulla oblongata and pons of the brainstem the cerebellum optic tectum thalamus hypothalamus basal ganglia olfactory bulb and many others as a mammalian brain the human brain has special features that are common to all mammalian brains most notably a sixlayered cerebral cortex and a set of structures associated with it including the hippocampus and amygdala all vertebrates have a forebrain whose upper surface is covered with a layer of neural tissue called the pallium but in all except mammals the pallium has a relatively simple threelayered cell structure in mammals it has a much more complex sixlayered cell structure and is given a different name the cerebral cortex the hippocampus and amygdala also originate from the pallium but are much more complex in mammals than in other vertebrates as a primate brain the human brain has a much larger cerebral cortex in proportion to body size than most mammals and a very highly developed visual system the shape of the brain within the skull is also altered somewhat as a consequence of the upright position in which primates hold their heads as a hominid brain the human brain is substantially enlarged even in comparison to the brain of a typical monkey the sequence of evolution from australopithecus four million years ago to homo sapiens modern man was marked by a steady increase in brain size particularly in the frontal lobes which are associated with a variety of highlevel cognitive functions humans and other primates have some differences in gene sequence and genes are differentially expressed in many brain regions the functional differences between the human brain and the brains of other animals also arise from many geneenvironment interactions  the neuroimmune system of the brain is structurally distinct from the peripheral immune system which protects the rest of the body in particular the immune system is composed primarily of hematopoietic cells and anatomical barriers while the neuroimmune system is composed of glia mast cells and various brain barriers eg bloodbrain barrier and bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier the dominant feature of the human brain is corticalization the cerebral cortex in humans is so large that it overshadows every other part of the brain a few subcortical structures show alterations reflecting this trend the cerebellum for example has a medial zone connected mainly to subcortical motor areas and a lateral zone connected primarily to the cortex in humans the lateral zone takes up a much larger fraction of the cerebellum than in most other mammalian species corticalization is reflected in function as well as structure in a rat surgical removal of the entire cerebral cortex leaves an animal that is still capable of walking around and interacting with the environment  in a human comparable cerebral cortex damage produces a permanent state of coma the amount of association cortex relative to the other two categories of sensory and motor increases dramatically as one goes from simpler mammals such as the rat and the cat to more complex ones such as the chimpanzee and the human  a gene present in the human genome but not in the chimpanzee arhgap11b seems to play a major role in corticalization arhgap11b and human encephalisation the cerebral cortex is essentially a sheet of neural tissue folded in a way that allows a large surface area to fit within the confines of the skull when unfolded each cerebral hemisphere has a total surface area of about 13 square feet 012m   each cortical ridge is called a gyrus and each groove or fissure separating one gyrus from another is called a sulcus the cerebral cortex is nearly symmetrical with left and right hemispheres that are approximate mirror images of each other each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes the frontal lobe parietal lobe occipital lobe and temporal lobe with one exception this division into lobes does not derive from the structure of the cortex though the lobes are named after the bones of the skull that overlie them the frontal bone parietal bone temporal bone and occipital bone the borders between lobes lie beneath the sutures that link the skull bones together the exception is the border between the frontal and parietal lobes which lies behind the corresponding suture instead it follows the anatomical boundary of the central sulcus a deep fold in the brains structure where the primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex meet because of the arbitrary way most of the borders between lobes are demarcated they have little functional significance with the exception of the occipital lobe a small area that is entirely dedicated to vision each of the lobes contains a variety of brain areas that have minimal functional relationship the parietal lobe for example contains areas involved in somatosensation hearing language attention and spatial cognition in spite of this heterogeneity the division into lobes is convenient for reference the main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention abstract thinking behavior problem solving tasks and physical reactions and personality the occipital lobe is the smallest lobe its main functions are visual reception visualspatial processing movement and color recognition the temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories language and some hearing and speech although there are enough variations in the shape and placement of gyri and sulci cortical folds to make every brain unique most human brains show sufficiently consistent patterns of folding that allow them to be named many of the gyri and sulci are named according to the location on the lobes or other major folds on the cortex these include functions of the cortex are divided it into three categories of regions one consists of the primary sensory areas which receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus primary sensory areas include the visual area of the occipital lobe the auditory area in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe a second category is the primary motor cortex which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord this area occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe directly in front of the somatosensory area the third category consists of the remaining parts of the cortex which are called the association areas these areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex processes of perception thought and decisionmaking  different parts of the cerebral cortex are involved in different cognitive and behavioral functions the differences show up in a number of ways the effects of localized brain damage regional activity patterns exposed when the brain is examined using functional imaging techniques connectivity with subcortical areas and regional differences in the cellular architecture of the cortex neuroscientists describe most of the cortexthe part they call the neocortexas having six layers but not all layers are apparent in all areas and even when a layer is present its thickness and cellular organization may vary scientists have constructed maps of cortical areas on the basis of variations in the appearance of the layers as seen with a microscope one of the most widely used schemes came from korbinian brodmann who split the cortex into 51 different areas and assigned each a number many of these brodmann areas have since been subdivided for example brodmann area 1 is the primary somatosensory cortex brodmann area 17 is the primary visual cortex and brodmann area 25 is the anterior cingulate cortex  many of the brain areas brodmann defined have their own complex internal structures in a number of cases brain areas are organized into topographic maps where adjoining bits of the cortex correspond to adjoining parts of the body or of some more abstract entity a simple example of this type of correspondence is the primary motor cortex a strip of tissue running along the anterior edge of the central sulcus shown in the image to the right motor areas innervating each part of the body arise from a distinct zone with neighboring body parts represented by neighboring zones electrical stimulation of the cortex at any point causes a musclecontraction in the represented body part this somatotopic representation is not evenly distributed however the head for example is represented by a region about three times as large as the zone for the entire back and trunk the size of any zone correlates to the precision of motor control and sensory discrimination possible the areas for the lips fingers and tongue are particularly large considering the proportional size of their represented body parts in visual areas the maps are retinotopicthat is they reflect the topography of the retina the layer of lightactivated neurons lining the back of the eye in this case too the representation is uneven the foveathe area at the center of the visual fieldis greatly overrepresented compared to the periphery the visual circuitry in the human cerebral cortex contains several dozen distinct retinotopic maps each devoted to analyzing the visual input stream in a particular way the primary visual cortex brodmann area 17 which is the main recipient of direct input from the visual part of the thalamus contains many neurons that are most easily activated by edges with a particular orientation moving across a particular point in the visual field visual areas farther downstream extract features such as color motion and shape in auditory areas the primary map is tonotopic sounds are parsed according to frequency ie high pitch vs low pitch by subcortical auditory areas and this parsing is reflected by the primary auditory zone of the cortex as with the visual system there are a number of tonotopic cortical maps each devoted to analyzing sound in a particular way within a topographic map there can sometimes be finer levels of spatial structure in the primary visual cortex for example where the main organization is retinotopic and the main responses are to moving edges cells that respond to different edgeorientations are spatially segregated from one another during the first three weeks of gestation the human embryos ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate the neural plate then folds and closes to form the neural tube this tube flexes as it grows forming the crescentshaped cerebral hemispheres at the head and the cerebellum and pons towards the tail understanding the mindbody problem  the relationship between the brain and the mind  is a significant challenge both philosophically and scientifically this is because of the difficulty reconciling how mental activities such as thoughts and emotions can be implemented by physical structures such as neurons and synapses or by any other type of physical mechanism this difficulty was expressed by gottfried leibniz in an analogy known as leibnizs mill one is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles that is by figures and motions in imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think to sense and to have perception one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions so that one could enter into it just like into a windmill supposing this one should when visiting within it find only parts pushing one another and never anything by which to explain a perception doubt about the possibility of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove rené descartes and most of humankind along with him to dualism the belief that the mind exists independently of the brain  there has always however been a strong argument in the opposite direction there is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of or injuries to the brain for example by drugs or by lesions respectively can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways  for example a person suffering from alzheimers disease  a condition that causes physical damage to the brain  also experiences a compromised mind similarly someone who has taken a psychedelic drug may temporarily lose their sense of personal identity ego death or experience profound changes to their perception and thought processes likewise a patient with epilepsy who undergoes cortical stimulation mapping with electrical brain stimulation would also upon stimulation of his or her brain experience various complex feelings hallucinations memory flashbacks and other complex cognitive emotional or behavioral phenomena  following this line of thinking a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of or reducible to physical phenomena  each hemisphere of the brain interacts primarily with one half of the body but for reasons that are unclear the connections are crossed the left side of the brain interacts with the right side of the body and vice versa  motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain both cross the midline at the level of the brainstem visual input follows a more complex rule the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm and half of the fibers from each nerve split off to join the other the result is that connections from the left half of the retina in both eyes go to the left side of the brain whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain and vice versa thus the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body and visual input from the left side of the visual fieldan arrangement that presumably is helpful for visuomotor coordination the two cerebral hemispheres are connected by a very large nerve bundle the largest white matter structure in the brain called the corpus callosum which crosses the midline above the level of the thalamus  there are also two much smaller connections the anterior commissure and hippocampal commissure as well as many subcortical connections that cross the midline the corpus callosum is the main avenue of communication between the two hemispheres though it connects each point on the cortex to the mirrorimage point in the opposite hemisphere and also connects to functionally related points in different cortical areas in most respects the left and right sides of the brain are symmetrical in terms of function for example the counterpart of the lefthemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the righthemisphere area controlling the left hand there are however several very important exceptions involving language and spatial cognition in most people the left hemisphere is dominant for language a stroke that damages a key language area in the left hemisphere can leave the victim unable to speak or understand whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills a substantial part of current understanding of the interactions between the two hemispheres has come from the study of splitbrain patientspeople who underwent surgical transection of the corpus callosum in an attempt to reduce the severity of epileptic seizures these patients do not show unusual behavior that is immediately obvious but in some cases can behave almost like two different people in the same body with the right hand taking an action and then the left hand undoing it most of these patients when briefly shown a picture on the right side of the point of visual fixation are able to describe it verbally but when the picture is shown on the left are unable to describe it but may be able to give an indication with the left hand of the nature of the object shown the study of how language is represented processed and acquired by the brain is neurolinguistics which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics this field originated from the 19thcentury discovery that damage to different parts of the brain appeared to cause different symptoms physicians noticed that individuals with damage to a portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus now known as brocas area had difficulty in producing language aphasia of speech whereas those with damage to a region in the left superior temporal gyrus now known as wernickes area had difficulty in understanding it  since then there has been substantial debate over what linguistic processes these and other parts of the brain subserve  and although brocas and wernickes areas have traditionally been associated with language functions they may also be involved in certain nonspeech functions  there is also debate over whether or not there even is a strong onetoone relationship between brain regions and language functions that emerges during neocortical development  more recently research on language has increasingly used more modern methods including electrophysiology and functional neuroimaging to examine how language processing occurs iodine t4 and pufas stimulate the evolution of the nervous system in fact hypothyroidism in mammals causes cretinism and in adults a neurological regression as a general slowdown of nervous reflexes with lethargic cerebration metabolism digestion heart rate hypothermia   the brain consumes up to twenty percent of the energy used by the human body more than any other organ  brain metabolism normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source but during times of low glucose such as fasting exercise or limited carbohydrate intake the brain will use ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose the brain can also utilize lactate during exercise  longchain fatty acids cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier but the liver can break these down to produce ketones however the mediumchain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain    the brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle  although the human brain represents only 2 of the body weight it receives 15 of the cardiac output 20 of total body oxygen consumption and 25 of total body glucose utilization  the need to limit body weight has led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species such as bats who need to be able to fly  the brain mostly uses glucose for energy and deprivation of glucose as can happen in hypoglycemia can result in loss of consciousness the energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions this fact forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods pet and fmri  these are nuclear medicine imaging techniques which produce a threedimensional image of metabolic activity clinically death is defined as an absence of brain activity as measured by eeg injuries to the brain tend to affect large areas of the organ sometimes causing major deficits in intelligence memory personality and movement head trauma caused for example by vehicular or industrial accidents is a leading cause of death in youth and middle age in many cases more damage is caused by resultant edema than by the impact itself stroke caused by the blockage or rupturing of blood vessels in the brain is another major cause of death from brain damage other problems in the brain can be more accurately classified as diseases neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimers disease parkinsons disease huntingtons disease and motor neuron diseases are caused by the gradual death of individual neurons leading to diminution in movement control memory and cognition there are five motor neuron diseases the most common of which is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als some infectious diseases affecting the brain are caused by viruses and bacteria infection of the meninges the membranes that cover the brain can lead to meningitis bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as mad cow disease is deadly in cattle and humans and is linked to prions kuru is a similar prionborne degenerative brain disease affecting humans endemic only to papua new guinea tribes both are linked to the ingestion of neural tissue and may explain the tendency in human and some nonhuman species to avoid cannibalism viral or bacterial causes have been reported in multiple sclerosis and are established causes of encephalopathy and encephalomyelitis brain tumors both benign and malignant can form these can either originate in the cerebral tissue or in the meninges the most common are those growths that affect the glial cells known as gliomas this term has been extended to include all primary brain tumors  secondary cancers can form in the brain as a result of brain metastasis mental disorders such as clinical depression schizophrenia bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder may involve particular patterns of neuropsychological functioning related to various aspects of mental and somatic function these disorders may be treated by psychotherapy psychiatric medication social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals many brain disorders are congenital occurring during development taysachs disease fragile x syndrome and down syndrome are all linked to genetic and chromosomal errors many other syndromes such as the intrinsic circadian rhythm disorders are suspected to be congenital as well normal development of the brain can be altered by genetic factors drug use nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases during pregnancy epileptic and nonepileptic seizures can cause cognitive impairment when the seizures become widespread occur repeatedly in the same brain area or last for too long seizures can be assessed using eeg and various medical imaging techniques they can sometimes be treated using anticonvulsant drugs and certain neurosurgical procedures and auxiliary treatments may also be used a key source of information about the function of brain regions is the effects of damage to them  in humans strokes have long provided a natural laboratory for studying the effects of brain damage most strokes result from a blood clot lodging in the brain and blocking the local blood supply causing damage or destruction of nearby brain tissue the range of possible blockages is very wide leading to a great diversity of stroke symptoms analysis of strokes is limited by the fact that damage often crosses into multiple regions of the brain not along clearcut borders making it difficult to draw firm conclusions transient ischemic attacks tias are ministrokes that can cause sudden dimming or loss of vision including amaurosis fugax speech impairment ranging from slurring to dysarthria or aphasia and mental confusion but unlike a stroke the symptoms of a tia can resolve within a few minutes or 24 hours brain injury may still occur in a tia lasting only a few minutes   a silent stroke or silent cerebral infarct sci differs from a tia in that there are no immediately observable symptoms an sci may still cause long lasting neurological dysfunction affecting such areas as mood personality and cognition an sci often occurs before or after a tia or major stroke  by placing electrodes on the scalp it is possible to record the summed electrical activity of the cortex using a methodology known as electroencephalography eeg  eeg records average neuronal activity from the cerebral cortex and can detect changes in activity over large areas but with low sensitivity for subcortical activity eeg recordings are sensitive enough to detect tiny electrical impulses lasting only a few milliseconds most eeg devices have good temporal resolution but low spatial resolution electrodes can also be placed directly on the surface of the brain usually during surgical procedures that require removal of part of the skull this technique called electrocorticography ecog offers finer spatial resolution than electroencephalography but is very invasive in addition to measuring the electric field directly via electrodes placed over the skull it is possible to measure the magnetic field that the brain generates using a method known as magnetoencephalography meg  this technique also has good temporal resolution like eeg but with much better spatial resolution the greatest disadvantage of meg is that because the magnetic fields generated by neural activity are very subtle the neural activity must be relatively close to the surface of the brain to detect its magnetic field megs can only detect the magnetic signatures of neurons located in the depths of cortical folds sulci that have dendrites oriented in a way that produces a field neuroscientists along with researchers from allied disciplines study how the human brain works such research has expanded considerably in recent decades the decade of the brain an initiative of the united states government in the 1990s is considered to have marked much of this increase in research  it has been followed in 2013 by the brain initiative information about the structure and function of the human brain comes from a variety of experimental methods most information about the cellular components of the brain and how they work comes from studies of animal subjects using techniques described in the brain article some techniques however are used mainly in humans and therefore are described here there are several methods for detecting brain activity changes using threedimensional imaging of local changes in blood flow the older methods are spect and pet which depend on injection of radioactive tracers into the bloodstream a newer method functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri has considerably better spatial resolution and involves no radioactivity  using the most powerful magnets currently available fmri can localize brain activity changes to regions as small as one cubic millimeter the downside is that the temporal resolution is poor when brain activity increases the blood flow response is delayed by 15seconds and lasts for at least 10seconds thus fmri is a very useful tool for learning which brain regions are involved in a given behavior but gives little information about the temporal dynamics of their responses a major advantage for fmri is that because it is noninvasive it can readily be used on human subjects another new noninvasive functional imaging method is functional nearinfrared spectroscopy function of animal and human brain with treatment of its malfunctioning diseases are described with simple logic like computer working  in the course of evolution of the homininae the human brain has grown in volume from about 600 cm  in homo habilis to about 1500cm  in homo sapiens neanderthalensis subsequently there has been a shrinking over the past 28000 years the male brain has decreased from 1500cm  to 1350cm  while the female brain has shrunk by the same relative proportion  for comparison homo erectus a relative of humans had a brain size of 1100cm  however the little homo floresiensis with a brain size of 380cm  a third of that of their proposed ancestor h erectus used fire hunted and made stone tools at least as sophisticated as those of h erectus  in spite of significant changes in social capacity there has been very little change in brain size from neanderthals to the present day  the notion as large as you need and as small as you can has been used to summarize the opposite evolutionary constraints on human brain size   changes in the size of the human brain during evolution have been reflected in changes in the aspm and microcephalin genes  studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations averaging around 03 to 04 between brain volume and iq  the most consistent associations are observed within the frontal temporal and parietal lobes the hippocampi and the cerebellum but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in iq which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and realworld performance    one study indicated that in humans fertility and intelligence tend to be negatively correlatedthat is to say the more intelligent as measured by iq exhibit a lower total fertility rate than the less intelligent according to the model the present rate of decline is predicted to be 134 iq points per decade  biochemistry sometimes called biological chemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms  by controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life over the last decades of the 20th century biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine to genetics are engaged in biochemical research  today the main focus of pure biochemistry is on understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells  which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms  much of biochemistry deals with the structures functions and interactions of biological macromolecules such as proteins nucleic acids carbohydrates and lipids which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life  the chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions these can be inorganic for example water and metal ions or organic for example the amino acids which are used to synthesize proteins  the mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism the findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine nutrition and agriculture in medicine biochemists investigate the causes and cures of disease  in nutrition they study how to maintain health and study the effects of nutritional deficiencies  in agriculture biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers and try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation crop storage and pest control around two dozen of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements are essential to various kinds of biological life most rare elements on earth are not needed by life exceptions being selenium and iodine while a few common ones aluminum and titanium are not used most organisms share element needs but there are a few differences between plants and animals for example ocean algae use bromine but land plants and animals seem to need none all animals require sodium but some plants do not plants need boron and silicon but animals may not or may need ultrasmall amounts just six elementscarbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen calcium and phosphorusmake up almost 99 of the mass of a human body see composition of the human body for a complete list in addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body humans require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more  the four main classes of molecules in biochemistry often called biomolecules are carbohydrates lipids proteins and nucleic acids  many biological molecules are polymers in this terminology monomers are relatively small micromolecules that are linked together to create large macromolecules known as polymers when monomers are linked together to synthesize a biological polymer they undergo a process called dehydration synthesis different macromolecules can assemble in larger complexes often needed for biological activity the function of carbohydrates includes energy storage and providing structure sugars are carbohydrates but not all carbohydrates are sugars there are more carbohydrates on earth than any other known type of biomolecule they are used to store energy and genetic information as well as play important roles in cell to cell interactions and communications the simplest type of carbohydrate is a monosaccharide which between other properties contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen mostly in a ratio of 121 generalized formula cnh2non where n is at least 3 glucose c6h12o6 is one of the most important carbohydrates others include fructose c6h12o6 the sugar commonly associated with the sweet taste of fruits   and deoxyribose c5h10o4 a monosaccharide could switches from the acyclic openchain form to a cyclic form through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyls of the same molecule the reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom the resulting molecule has an hemiacetal or hemiketal group depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a ketose the reaction is easily reversed yielding the original openchain form  in these cyclic forms the ring usually has 5 or 6 atoms these forms are called furanoses and pyranoses respectively by analogy with furan and pyran the simplest compounds with the same carbonoxygen ring although they lack the double bonds of these two molecules for example the aldohexose glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4 yielding a molecule with a 5membered ring called glucofuranose the same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6membered ring called glucopyranose cyclic forms with a 7atom ring the same of oxepane rarely encountered are called heptoses when two monosaccharides undergo dehydration synthesis whereby a molecule of water is released as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are lost from the two monosaccharides the new molecule consisting of two monosaccharides is called a disaccharide and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or ether bond the reverse reaction can also occur using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond this is termed hydrolysis the most wellknown disaccharide is sucrose ordinary sugar in scientific contexts called table sugar or cane sugar to differentiate it from other sugars sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together another important disaccharide is lactose consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule as most humans age the production of lactase the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and galactose typically decreases this results in lactase deficiency also called lactose intolerance when a few around three to six monosaccharides are joined it is called an oligosaccharide oligo meaning few these molecules tend to be used as markers and signals as well as having some other uses  many monosaccharides joined together make a polysaccharide they can be joined together in one long linear chain or they may be branched two of the most common polysaccharides are cellulose and glycogen both consisting of repeating glucose monomers examples are cellulose which is an important structural component of plants cell walls and glycogen used as a form of energy storage in animals sugar can be characterized by having reducing or nonreducing ends a reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the openchain aldehyde aldose or keto form ketose if the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an ohsidechain of another sugar yielding a full acetal this prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue nonreducing lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety whereas the galactose moiety form a full acetal with the c4oh group of glucose saccharose does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose c1 and the keto carbon of fructose c2 lipids comprises a diverse range of molecules and to some extent is a catchall for relatively waterinsoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin including waxes fatty acids fattyacid derived phospholipids sphingolipids glycolipids and terpenoids eg retinoids and steroids some lipids are linear aliphatic molecules while others have ring structures some are aromatic while others are not some are flexible while others are rigid  lipids are usually made from one molecule of glycerol combined with other molecules in triglycerides the main group of bulk lipids there is one molecule of glycerol and three fatty acids fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case and may be saturated no double bonds in the carbon chain or unsaturated one or more double bonds in the carbon chain  most lipids have some polar character in addition to being largely nonpolar in general the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or hydrophobic waterfearing meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water another part of their structure is polar or hydrophilic waterloving and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water this makes them amphiphilic molecules having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions in the case of cholesterol the polar group is a mere oh hydroxyl or alcohol in the case of phospholipids the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar as described below  lipids are an integral part of our daily diet most oils and milk products that we use for cooking and eating like butter cheese ghee etc are composed of fats vegetable oils are rich in various polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa lipidcontaining foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids lipids especially phospholipids are also used in various pharmaceutical products either as cosolubilisers eg in parenteral infusions or else as drug carrier components eg in a liposome or transfersome proteins are very large molecules  macrobiopolymers  made from monomers called amino acids an amino acid consists of a carbon atom bound to four groups one is an amino group nh2 and one is a carboxylic acid group cooh although these exist as nh3  and coo  under physiologic conditions the third is a simple hydrogen atom the fourth is commonly denoted r and is different for each amino acid there are 20 standard amino acids each containing a carboxyl group an amino group and a sidechain known as an r group the r group is what makes each amino acid different and the properties of the sidechains greatly influence the overall threedimensional conformation of a protein some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form for instance glutamate functions as an important neurotransmitter amino acids can be joined via a peptide bond in this dehydration synthesis a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acids amino group to the carbon of the others carboxylic acid group the resulting molecule is called a dipeptide and short stretches of amino acids usually fewer than thirty are called peptides or polypeptides longer stretches merit the title proteins as an example the important blood serum protein albumin contains 585 amino acid residues  some proteins perform largely structural roles for instance movements of the proteins actin and myosin ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle one property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of moleculesthey may be extremely selective in what they bind antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule in fact the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa which uses antibodies is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules probably the most important proteins however are the enzymes these molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called substrates they then catalyze the reaction between them by lowering the activation energy the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10  or more a reaction that would normally take over 3000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme the enzyme itself is not used up in the process and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates using various modifiers the activity of the enzyme can be regulated enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole the structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels the primary structure of a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids for instance alanineglycinetryptophanserineglutamateasparagineglycinelysine secondary structure is concerned with local morphology morphology being the study of structure some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an \u03b1helix or into a sheet called a \u03b2sheet some \u03b1helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above tertiary structure is the entire threedimensional shape of the protein this shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids in fact a single change can change the entire structure the alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues substitution of the glutamate residue at position 6 with a valine residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in sicklecell disease finally quaternary structure is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits like hemoglobin with its four subunits not all proteins have more than one subunit  ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the small intestine and then absorbed they can then be joined to make new proteins intermediate products of glycolysis the citric acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway can be used to make all twenty amino acids and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them humans and other mammals however can synthesize only half of them they cannot synthesize isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine tryptophan and valine these are the essential amino acids since it is essential to ingest them mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine asparagine aspartate cysteine glutamate glutamine glycine proline serine and tyrosine the nonessential amino acids while they can synthesize arginine and histidine they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young growing animals and so these are often considered essential amino acids if the amino group is removed from an amino acid it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an \u03b1keto acid enzymes called transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid making it an \u03b1keto acid to another \u03b1keto acid making it an amino acid this is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids as for many of the pathways intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the \u03b1keto acid skeleton and then an amino group is added often via transamination the amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein  a similar process is used to break down proteins it is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids free ammonia nh3 existing as the ammonium ion nh4  in blood is toxic to life forms a suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist different tactics have evolved in different animals depending on the animals needs unicellular organisms of course simply release the ammonia into the environment likewise bony fish can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted in general mammals convert the ammonia into urea via the urea cycle  in order to determine whether two proteins are related or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not scientists use sequencecomparison methods methods like sequence alignments and structural alignments are powerful tools that help scientists identify homologies between related molecules  the relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of protein families by finding how similar two protein sequences are we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function nucleic acids so called because of its prevalence in cellular nuclei is the generic name of the family of biopolymers they are complex highmolecularweight biochemical macromolecules that can convey genetic information in all living cells and viruses  the monomers are called nucleotides and each consists of three components a nitrogenous heterocyclic base either a purine or a pyrimidine a pentose sugar and a phosphate group  the most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid dna and ribonucleic acid rna  the phosphate group and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information the most common nitrogenous bases are adenine cytosine guanine thymine and uracil the nitrogenous bases of each strand of a nucleic acid will form hydrogen bonds with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid similar to a zipper adenine binds with thymine and uracil thymine binds only with adenine and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another aside from the genetic material of the cell nucleic acids often play a role as second messengers as well as forming the base molecule for adenosine triphosphate atp the primary energycarrier molecule found in all living organisms  also the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different adenine cytosine and guanine occur in both rna and dna while thymine occurs only in dna and uracil occurs in rna glucose is the major energy source in most life forms for instance polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers glycogen phosphorylase removes glucose residues from glycogen disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important tenstep pathway called glycolysis the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate this also produces a net two molecules of atp the energy currency of cells along with two reducing equivalents of converting nad  to nadh this does not require oxygen if no oxygen is available or the cell cannot use oxygen the nad is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate lactic acid eg in humans or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide eg in yeast other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway  in aerobic cells with sufficient oxygen as in most human cells the pyruvate is further metabolized it is irreversibly converted to acetylcoa giving off one carbon atom as the waste product carbon dioxide generating another reducing equivalent as nadh the two molecules acetylcoa from one molecule of glucose then enter the citric acid cycle producing two more molecules of atp six more nadh molecules and two reduced ubiquinones via fadh2 as enzymebound cofactor and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide the produced nadh and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes thus oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors nad  and quinone are regenerated this is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide the energy released from transferring the electrons from highenergy states in nadh and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to atp via atp synthase this generates an additional 28 molecules of atp 24 from the 8 nadh  4 from the 2 quinols totaling to 32 molecules of atp conserved per degraded glucose two from glycolysis  two from the citrate cycle  it is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygenindependent metabolic feature and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after earths atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen in vertebrates vigorously contracting skeletal muscles during weightlifting or sprinting for example do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand and so they shift to anaerobic metabolism converting glucose to lactate the liver regenerates the glucose using a process called gluconeogenesis this process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis six molecules of atp are used compared to the two gained in glycolysis analogous to the above reactions the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy be stored as glycogen or starch in plants or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di or oligosaccharides the combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise lactates crossing via the bloodstream to the liver subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the cori cycle  researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of genetics molecular biology and biophysics there has never been a hardline among these disciplines in

\u02c8ækt\u1d7bna\u026ad or actinoid \u02c8ækt\u1d7bn\u0254\u026ad iupac nomenclature series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103 actinium through lawrencium     the actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series actinium the informal chemical symbol an is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide all but one of the actinides are fblock elements corresponding to the filling of the 5f electron shell lawrencium a dblock element is also generally considered an actinide in comparison with the lanthanides also mostly fblock elements the actinides show much more variable valence they all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties while actinium and the late actinides from americium onwards behave similarly to the lanthanides the elements thorium through neptunium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry all actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay naturally occurring uranium and thorium and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on earth these are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors of the actinides primordial thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial quantities and small amounts of persisting natural plutonium have also been identified the radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium and protactinium and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation reactions in uranium ores the other actinides are purely synthetic elements   nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment analysis of debris from a 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion showed the presence of

inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places as parts of the tables sixth and seventh rows periods alkali metal the alkali metals are a group column in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium li sodium na potassium k  rubidium rb caesium cs  and francium fr this group lies in the sblock of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an sorbital this elementelectron configuration results in their characteristic properties the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting wellcharacterized homologous behaviour the alkali metals have very similar properties they are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge 1 they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free element in the modern iupac nomenclature the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements  excluding hydrogen h which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature in order of abundance sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity and thus occurs only in traces due to its presence in natural decay chains experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium uue which is likely to be the next member of the group but they have all met with failure however ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues most alkali metals have many different applications two of the most wellknown applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium atomic clocks of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time a common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodiumvapour lamp which emits very efficient light table salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity sodium and potassium are also essential elements having major biological roles as electrolytes and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful the alkaline earth metals are six chemical elements in column group 2 of the periodic table they are beryllium be magnesium mg calcium ca strontium sr barium ba and radium ra  they have very similar properties they are all shiny silverywhite somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure  structurally they have in common an outer s electron shell which is full    that is this orbital contains its full complement of two electrons which these elements readily lose to form cations with charge 2 and an oxidation state oxidation number of 2  all the discovered alkaline earth metals occur in nature  experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of element 120 the next potential member of the group but they have all met with failure the lanthanide \u02c8læn\u03b8\u0259na\u026ad or lanthanoid \u02c8læn\u03b8\u0259n\u0254\u026ad series of chemical elements  comprises the fifteen metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers 57 through 71 from lanthanum through lutetium    these fifteen lanthanide elements along with the chemically similar elements scandium and yttrium are often collectively known as the rare earth elements the informal chemical symbol ln is used in general discussions of lanthanide chemistry to refer to any lanthanide all but one of the lanthanides are fblock elements corresponding to the filling of the 4f electron shell lutetium a dblock element is also generally considered to be a lanthanide due to its chemical similarities with the other fourteen all lanthanide elements form trivalent cations ln  whose chemistry is largely determined by the ionic radius which decreases steadily from lanthanum to lutetium they are termed as lanthanides because the lighter elements in the series are chemically similar to lanthanum strictly speaking both lanthanum and lutetium have been labeled as group 3 elements because they both have a single valence electron in the d shell however both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements in presentations of the periodic table the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows

V the premotor cortex is an area of motor cortex lying within the frontal lobe of the brain just anterior to the primary motor cortex it occupies part of brodmanns area 6 it has been studied mainly in primates including monkeys and humans the functions of the premotor cortex are diverse and not fully understood it projects directly to the spinal cord and therefore may play a role in the direct control of behavior with a relative emphasis on the trunk muscles of the body it may also play a role in planning movement in the spatial guidance of movement in the sensory guidance of movement in understanding the actions of others and in using abstract rules to perform specific tasks different subregions of the premotor cortex have different properties and presumably emphasize different functions   the premotor cortex occupies the part of brodmann area 6 that lies on the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere the medial extension of area 6 onto the midline surface of the hemisphere is the site of the supplementary motor area or sma the premotor cortex can be distinguished from the primary motor cortex brodmann area 4 just posterior to it based on two main anatomical markers first the primary motor cortex contains giant pyramidal cells called betz cells in layer v whereas giant pyramidal cells are less common and smaller in the premotor cortex second the primary motor cortex is agranular it lacks a layer iv marked by the presence of granule cells the premotor cortex is dysgranular it contains a faint layer iv the premotor cortex can be distinguished from brodmann area 46 of the prefrontal cortex just anterior to it by the presence of a fully formed granular layer iv in area 46 the premotor cortex is therefore anatomically a transition between the agranular motor cortex and the granular sixlayered prefrontal cortex the premotor cortex has been divided into finer subregions on the basis of cytoarchitecture the appearance of the cortex under a microscope cytohistochemistry the manner in which the cortex appears when stained by various chemical substances anatomical connectivity to other brain areas and physiological properties     these divisions are summarized below in divisions of the premotor cortex the connectivity of the premotor cortex is diverse partly because the premotor cortex itself is heterogenous and different subregions have different connectivity generally the premotor cortex has strong afferent input and efferent output connectivity to the primary motor cortex the supplementary motor area the superior and inferior parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex subcortically it projects to the spinal cord the striatum and the motor thalamus among other structures the premotor cortex is now generally divided into four sections    first it is divided into an upper or dorsal premotor cortex and a lower or ventral premotor cortex each of these is further divided into a region more toward the front of the brain rostral premotor cortex and a region more toward the back caudal premotor cortex a set of acronyms are commonly used pmdr premotor dorsal rostral pmdc premotor dorsal caudal pmvr premotor ventral rostral pmvc premotor ventral caudal some researchers especially those who study the ventral premotor areas use a different terminology field 7 or f7 denotes pmdr f2  pmdc f5pmvr f4pmvc these subdivisions of premotor cortex were originally described and remain primarily studied in the monkey brain exactly how they may correspond to areas of the human brain or whether the organization in the human brain is somewhat different is not yet clear pmdc is often studied with respect to its role in guiding reaching    neurons in pmdc are active during reaching when monkeys are trained to reach from a central location to a set of target locations neurons in pmdc are active during the preparation for the reach and also during the reach itself they are broadly tuned responding best to one direction of reach and less well to different directions electrical stimulation of the pmdc on a behavioral time scale was reported to evoke a complex movement of the shoulder arm and hand that resembles reaching with the hand opened in preparation to grasp  pmdr may participate in learning to associate arbitrary sensory stimuli with specific movements or learning arbitrary response rules    in this sense it may resemble the prefrontal cortex more than other motor cortex fields it may also have some relation to eye movement electrical stimulation in the pmdr can evoke eye movements  and neuronal activity in the pmdr can be modulated by eye movement  pmvc or f4 is often studied with respect to its role in the sensory guidance of movement neurons here are responsive to tactile stimuli visual stimuli and auditory stimuli     these neurons are especially sensitive to objects in the space immediately surrounding the body in socalled peripersonal space electrical stimulation of these neurons causes an apparent defensive movement as if protecting the body surface   this premotor region may be part of a larger circuit for maintaining a margin of safety around the body and guiding movement with respect to nearby objects  pmvr or f5 is often studied with respect to its role in shaping the hand during grasping and in interactions between the hand and the mouth   electrical stimulation of at least some parts of f5 when the stimulation is applied on a behavioral time scale evokes a complex movement in which the hand moves to the mouth closes in a grip orients such that the grip faces the mouth the neck turns to align the mouth to the hand and the mouth opens   mirror neurons were first discovered in area f5 in the monkey brain by rizzolatti and colleagues   these neurons are active when the monkey grasps an object yet the same neurons become active when the monkey watches an experimenter grasp an object in the same way the neurons are therefore both sensory and motor mirror neurons are proposed to be a basis for understanding the actions of others by internally imitating the actions using ones own motor control circuits in the earliest work on the motor cortex researchers recognized only one cortical field involved in motor control campbell  in 1905 was the first to suggest that there might be two fields a primary motor cortex and an intermediate precentral motor cortex his reasons were largely based on cytoarchitectonics the primary motor cortex contains cells with giant cell bodies known as betz cells the betz cells are rare or absent in the adjacent cortex on similar criteria brodmann  in 1909 also distinguished between his area 4 coextensive with the primary motor cortex and his area 6 coextensive with the premotor cortex vogt and vogt   in 1919 also suggested that motor cortex was divided into a primary motor cortex area 4 and a higherorder motor cortex area 6 adjacent to it furthermore in their account area 6 could be divided into 6a the dorsal part and 6b the ventral part the dorsal part could be further divided into 6aalpha a posterior part adjacent to the primary motor cortex and 6abeta an anterior part adjacent to the prefrontal cortex these cortical fields formed a hierarchy in which 6abeta controlled movement at the most complex level 6aalpha had intermediate properties and the primary motor cortex controlled movement at the simplest level vogt and vogt are therefore the original source of the idea of a caudal 6aalpha and a rostral 6abeta premotor cortex fulton  in 1935 helped to solidify the distinction between a primary motor map of the body in area 4 and a higherorder premotor cortex in area 6 his main evidence came from lesion studies in monkeys it is not clear where the term premotor came from or who used it first but fulton popularized the term a caveat about the premotor cortex noted early in its study is that the hierarchy between the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex is not absolute instead both the premotor cortex and primary motor cortex project directly to the spinal cord and each has some capability to control movement even in the absence of the other therefore the two cortical fields operate at least partly in parallel rather than in a strict hierarchy this parallel relationship was noted as early as 1919 by vogt and vogt   and also emphasized by fulton  penfield  in 1937 notably disagreed with the idea of a premotor cortex he suggested that there was no functional distinction between a primary motor and a premotor area in his view both were part of the same map the most posterior part of the map in area 4 emphasized the hand and fingers and the most anterior part in area 6 emphasized the muscles of the back and neck woolsey  who studied the motor map in monkeys in 1956 also believed there was no distinction between primary motor and premotor cortex he used the term m1 for the proposed single map that encompassed both the primary motor cortex and the premotor cortex he used the term m2 for the medial motor cortex now commonly known as the supplementary motor area sometimes in modern reviews m1 is incorrectly equated with the primary motor cortex given this work by penfield on the human brain and by woolsey on the monkey brain by the 1960s the idea of a lateral premotor cortex as separate from the primary motor cortex had mainly disappeared from the literature instead m1 was considered to be a single map of the body perhaps with complex properties arranged along the central sulcus the hypothesis of a separate premotor cortex reemerged and gained ground in the 1980s several key lines of research helped to establish the premotor cortex by showing that it had properties distinct from those of the adjacent primary motor cortex roland and colleagues   studied the dorsal premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area in humans while blood flow in the brain was monitored in a positron emission scanner when people made complex sensoryguided movements such as following verbal instructions more blood flow was measured in the dorsal premotor cortex when people made internally paced sequences of movements more blood flow was measured in the supplementary motor area when people made simple movements that required little planning such as palpating an object with the hand the blood flow was more limited to the primary motor cortex by implication the primary motor cortex was more involved in execution of simple movement the premotor cortex was more involved in sensory guided movement and the supplementary motor area was more involved in internally generated movements wise and his colleagues    studied the dorsal premotor cortex of monkeys the monkeys were trained to perform a delayed response task making a movement in response to a sensory instruction cue during the task neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex became active in response to the sensory cue and often remained active during the few seconds of delay or preparation time before the monkey performed the instructed movement neurons in the primary motor cortex showed much less activity during the preparation period and were more likely to be active only during the movement itself by implication the dorsal premotor cortex was more involved in planning or preparing for movement and the primary motor cortex more involved in executing movement rizzolatti and colleagues   divided the premotor cortex into four parts or fields based on cytoarchitectonics two dorsal fields and two ventral fields they then studied the properties of the ventral premotor fields establishing tactile visual and motor properties of a complex nature summarized in greater detail below in divisions of the premotor cortex    at least three representations of the hand were reported in the motor cortex one in the primary motor cortex one in the ventral premotor cortex and one in the dorsal premotor cortex   by implication at least three different cortical fields may exist each one performing its own special function in relation to the fingers and wrist for these and other reasons a consensus has now emerged that the lateral motor cortex does not consist of a single simple map of the body but instead contains multiple subregions including the primary motor cortex and several premotor fields these premotor fields have diverse properties some project to the spinal cord and may play a direct role in movement control whereas others do not whether these cortical areas are arranged in a hierarchy or share some other more complex relationship is still debated graziano and colleagues suggested an alternative principle of organization for the primary motor cortex and the caudal part of the premotor cortex all regions that project directly to the spinal cord and that were included in the penfield and woolsey definition of m1 in this alternative proposal the motor cortex is organized as a map of the natural behavioral repertoire   the complicated multifaceted nature of the behavioral repertoire results in a complicated heterogeneous map in cortex in which different parts of the movement repertoire are emphasized in different cortical subregions more complex movements such as reaching or climbing require more coordination among body parts the processing of more complex control variables the monitoring of objects in the space near the body and planning several seconds into the future other parts of the movement repertoire such as manipulating an object with the fingers once the object has been acquired or manipulating an object in the mouth involve less planning less computation of spatial trajectory and more control of individual joint rotations and muscle forces in this view the more complex movements especially multisegmental movements come to be emphasized in the more anterior part of the motor map because that cortex emphasizes the musculature of the back and neck which serves as the coordinating link between body parts in contrast the simpler parts of the movement repertoire that tend to focus more on the distal musculature are emphasized in the more posterior cortex in this alternative view though movements of lesser complexity are emphasized in the primary motor cortex and movements of greater complexity are emphasized in the caudal premotor cortex this difference does not necessarily imply a control hierarchy instead the regions differ from each other and contain subregions with differing properties because the natural movement repertoire itself is heterogeneous

V the extrastriate body area eba is a subpart of the extrastriate visual cortex involved in the visual perception of human body and body parts akin in its respective domain to the fusiform face area involved in the perception of human faces the eba was identified in 2001 by the team of nancy kanwisher using fmri  the extrastriate body area is a categoryselective region for the visual processing of static and moving images of the human body and parts of it it is also modulated even in the absence of visual feedback from the limb movement it is insensitive to faces and stimulus categories unrelated to the human body the extrastriate cortex responds not only during the perception of other peoples body parts but also during goaldirected movement of the participants body parts  the extrastriate cortex represents the human body in a more integrative and dynamic manner being able to detect an incongruence of internal body or action representations and external visual signals in this way the eba might be able to support the disentangling of ones own behavior from anothers  as published in the article a cortical area selective for visual processing of the human body  researcher paul e downing yuhong jiang miles shuman and nancy kanwisher first discovered the eba in 2001 the experiment originally intended to find out what area of the brain dealt with the human form and recognition of body parts as the face had been mapped to a specific area of the brain fusiform face area ffa by nancy kanwisher in 1997  what the experiment found was a specific area of the lateral occipitotemporal cortex that responds selectively to visual images of human bodies and body parts with the exception of faces the experiment had subjects view images of different objects including faces as a control group body parts animals parts of the face and intimate objects while viewing the images the subjects were scanned with an fmri to see what area of the brain was activated through the trials a compilation of the fmris was made from this compilation image a specific region was determined to have increased activity when shown visual stimuli of body parts and even more activity when viewing whole bodies there have been no studies involving brain damage to the eba thus far only scans of brain activity as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation have been used to study the eba to find the specific functions of the eba comimo urgesi giovanni berlucchi and salvatore m aglioti used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms to disrupt part of the brain making the brain less responsive in the target area the study used eventrelated rtms to disrupt the eba resulting in inactivation of cortical areas this inactivation caused a slower response time in discriminating body parts the study used facial features and motorcycle parts as non human parts for control groups the facial features and motorcycle body parts did not display any change in response time the neural activity data shows the eba handles some of the visual processing of human body and parts but is not related to the processing of the face or other objects the actual experiment had people make a twochoice matchingtosample task fourteen right handed participants were required to decide which of two similar upperlimb images matched a single sample previously seen during a tachistoscopic exposure photos of face parts and motorcycle parts served as control stimuli in twomatchingtosample tasks that were comparable to the former task  rtms was then applied 150 ms after each sample exposure the section of the graph body parts shows the response time while using rtms the sham category refers to measuring the eba without rtms while viewing the images the visual cortex category measures the response of the ffa to be used as the control of the experiment this measurement of response time occurring while rtms was effecting the eba further shows that the two areas process visual data of the human form yet respond to different stimuli while the magnetic stimulation was temporarily disabling the extrastraite body area reaction time decreased by about 100 ms the data from the sham and visual cortex categories on the graph show what was the expected normal results from the experiment this evidence reveals that applying rtms to the eba slowed the response of recognizing images of body parts

V in general surgery a rouxeny anastomosis or rouxeny is a surgically created endtoside anastomosis most commonly performed for weight loss or to remove a malignancy in laymans terms after this procedure food can go more directly into the small intestine unfortunately the reduced time in the stomach means partially digested food goes into the small intestine which tends to produce undesirable digestive problems typically the surgical change is between stomach and small bowel that is distal or further down the gastrointestinal tract from the cut end    the name roux is derived from the surgeon who first described it césar roux  and the stickfigure representation diagrammatically the rouxeny anastomosis looks a little like the letter y typically the two upper limbs of the y represent 1 the proximal segment of stomach and the distal small bowel it joins with and 2 the blind end that is surgically divided off and the lower part of the y is formed by the distal small bowel beyond the anastomosis rouxenys are used in several operations and collectively called roux operations  roux en y surgery can dramatically change food digestion dynamics most of them negatively one major change relates to digestion processes and the other major change to malabsorption deficits food digestion in the stomach has several beneficial results in the stomach the hydrochloric acid used for initial digestion can also kill pathogens that might otherwise reproduce and cause an infection or nonpathogenic diarrhea and with the aid of stomach acids food is broken down so that nutrients can be better removed by the small intestine the last benefit is that some food presentations are changed to be digestible which otherwise might be rejected by the small intestine avoiding nonpathogenic diarrhea the intestines method of rejecting and ejecting undesirable materials a common digestive result of roux surgery is dumping syndrome a type of diarrhea in which the fecal matter is popcorn sized in appearance   the most common suggestions to avoid dumping include 1 eat proteins first fruits and vegetables second and carbohydrates last 2 dont drink during meals 3 dont drink liquids for one hour before meals 4 dont drink liquids for several hours after meals 5 avoid sugary beverages sweet tea soda beer lemonade liquor etc 6 avoid watery foods soup ramen noodles etc 7 avoid sugary foods cake with icing donuts etc next nutritional factors are changed in roux surgery the first part of the intestine after the stomach is the small intestine whose primary job is to absorb nutrients the large intestines primary job is to remove residual water from the remaining fecal matter nutritional deficiencies can result from roux surgery because every inch of the small intestine is vital for nutritional absorption and many roux surgeries result in the initial parts of the small intestine being bypassed by all or some of the food all roux surgeries result in a new stomach outlet and that open exit door is the source of numerous problems a normal stomach has a muscled pyloric canal which opens and closes it closes to contain food and allow the digestive processes to occur then it opens to permit digested foods to enter the small intestine  but the roux surgery creates a constantly open hole in the stomach bottom which allows undigested food to freely enter the small intestine when that unusual format food contains a high liquid content or refined sugars soda beer cake icing carbohydrates etc the intestine begins moving that food to the anus as quickly as possibly creating dumping syndrome dumping continues until the offending foods in the small intestine are ejected from the large intestine and anus with a normal intestine of about 30feet six or eight bowel movements are typically required going from normal fecal compositions to watery that is fecal type 3 to type 7 on the bristol stool chart see wikipedia human feces  malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies occur for several reasons the first inch of the small intestine is the primary point for the absorption of iron other parts of the small intestine are related to other specific vitamins and minerals all roux en y patients require lifelong blood monitoring beginning about 4months after surgery to identify precise nutritional deficits and needed vitaminmineral supplements next because undigested food is less suitable for nutritional extracting some weight loss can be expected and if the roux surgery included removal of part of the stomach with the patient subsequently eating smaller portions that further reduces nutritional extraction and further contributes to weight loss andor nutritional deficiencies  last the transit time for food may be reduced based on sugar content fluid content and undigested foods in other words if the time from mouth to bowel movement is reduced there is less time for the intestines to remove nutrients again contributing to nutritional deficits and weight loss where weight loss was the primary objective that may be acceptable but for patients who have roux surgery due to pyloric inflammation stomach cancer etc weight loss can become a new chronic health problem for the patient contributing this paragraph roux surgery was for an inflamed pylorus after roux surgery i lost 24 pounds although i was already very thin to maximize my digestion and reduce transit time after eating i lie on my stomach for two hours the roux open hole connection is on the back of my stomach and wait until bedtime to get all my daily liquid intake using this protocol i can reduce my bowel movements to one per day if i drink water between meals it results in five to six small bowel movements per day plus one normal bm for me the medical literature advice of eating four to six small meals resulted in four to six bms per day as did sipping water throughout the day   when describing the surgery the roux limb is the efferent or antegrade limb that serves as the primary recipient of food after the surgery while the hepatobiliary or afferent limb that anatamoses with biliary system serves as the recipient for biliary secretions which then travel through the residual stomach from the liver and into the roux limb to aid digestion the altered anatomy can contribute to indigestion following surgery

V the kilgourmatas report is a 20062007 investigative report into allegations of live organ harvesting in china conducted by canadian mp david kilgour and human rights lawyer david matas the report was requested by the coalition to investigate the persecution of falun gong cipfg after allegations emerged that falun gong practitioners were secretly having their organs removed against their will at sujiatun thrombosis hospital  the report based on circumstantial evidence concluded that there has been and continues today to be largescale organ seizures from unwilling falun gong practitioners  china has consistently denied the allegations   the initial report received a mixed reception in the us a congressional research service report by dr thomas lum stated that the kilgourmatas report relied largely on logical inference without bringing forth new or independently obtained testimony the credibility of much of the key evidence was said to be questionable  the initial 6 july 2006 report found that the source of 41500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained and concluded that there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling falun gong practitioners  un special rapporteur manfred nowak said in march 2007 that the chain of evidence kilgour and matas were documenting showed a coherent picture that causes concern  which the united nations committee against torture followed up in november 2008 with a request for a full explanation of the source of organ transplants to investigate the claims of organ harvesting and to take measures to prosecute those committing abuses  other investigators such as ethan gutmann followed the kilgourmatas report gutmann estimating that between 450000 to 1 million falun gong members were detained at any given time and estimated that tens of thousands may have been targeted for organ harvesting   upon release of the initial report on 6 july 2006 chinese officials declared that china abides by world health organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors they denounced the report as smears based on rumours and false allegations and said the chinese government had already investigated the claims and found them without any merit   the report is banned in russia and china  among international concerns the us national kidney foundation expressed that it was deeply concerned about the allegations  in 2009 the authors published an updated version of the report as a book titled bloody harvestthe killing of falun gong for their organs   and in the same year received an award from the international society for human rights    falun gong is a spiritual discipline that combines meditation and exercises with a moral philosophy emerged in china in the 1990s by 1999 the number of practitioners was estimated in the tens of millions   in july 1999 following a largescale demonstration to request official recognition chinese authorities initiated a nationwide campaign to suppress the group and created the 610 office to oversee and coordinate the elimination of falun gong    the suppression that followed was accompanied by what amnesty international called a massive propaganda campaign  as well as the detention and imprisonment of tens of thousands of falun gong adherents   former detainees reported that in some labour camps falun gong practitioners comprised the majority population and were singled out for abuse    under order from beijing practitioners are subject to coercive reeducation and torture sometimes resulting in deaths    due to limited access to victims and labour camp facilities however many specific reports of abuses are difficult to independently corroborate  china has had an organ transplantation programme since the 1960s it is one of the largest organ transplant programmes in the world peaking at over 13000 transplants a year in 2004  involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under chinese law although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives by the 1990s growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice  these concerns resurfaced in 2001 when the washington post reported claims by a chinese asylumseeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations by 2005 the world medical association had specifically demanded that china cease using prisoners as organ donors  in december of that year chinas deputy health minister acknowledged that the practice of removing organs from executed prisoners for transplant was widespread  as many as 95 of all organ transplants in china derived from executions  and he promised steps to prevent abuse   the first allegations of systematic organ harvesting from falun gong practitioners were made in march 2006 by two individuals claiming to possess knowledge of involuntary organ extractions at the sujiatun thrombosis hospital in shenyang liaoning province the allegations were publicized by the epoch times a newspaper group founded by falun gong practitioners  within one month of the press coverage third party investigators including representatives of the us department of state said that there was insufficient evidence to prove the allegations  in 2006 and 2008 united nations special rapporteurs raised questions about the sources of organs the short waiting times for finding perfectly matched organs and the correlation between the sudden increase in organ transplants in china and the beginning of the persecution of falun gong practitioners these requests were not satisfactorily addressed by the chinese authorities69 in november 2008 the united nations committee against torture noted its concern at the allegations and called for china to immediately conduct or commission an independent investigation of the claims and take measures to ensure that those responsible for such abuses are prosecuted and punished7chinese dissident harry wu who exposed organ harvesting from prison inmates at laogai hard labour camps questioned the credibility of the sujiatun whistleblowers   but harry wus july 2006 article showed his views in his march 21 letter were formed before completing his investigation so harry wus views were not based on his full investigation further harry wu characterized the volume of organ harvesting annie described as technically impossible but in fact it is technically possible according to medical expert   on april 14 2006 the us state department wrote that us representatives have found no evidence to support allegations that a site in northeast china has been used as a concentration camp to jail falun gong practitioners and harvest their organs adding independent of these specific allegations the united states remains concerned over chinas repression of falun gong practitioners and by reports of organ harvesting  soon thereafter in may 2006 the coalition to investigate the persecution of falun gong asked david kilgour as well as canadian human rights lawyer david matas to investigate the broader allegations of organ harvesting from falun gong adherents in china kilgour and matas agreed to investigate   on 20 july 2006 kilgour and matas presented the findings of their twomonth investigation as report into allegations of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in china  the report presented 33 strands of circumstantial evidence that kilgour and matas felt in the absence of any disproof cumulatively allowed the conclusion that the government of china and its agencies in numerous parts of the country in particular hospitals but also detention centres and peoples courts since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of falun gong prisoners of conscience their vital organs including kidneys livers corneas and hearts were seized involuntarily for sale at high prices sometimes to foreigners who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries  the report called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in chinaone to two weeks for a liver compared with 325 months in canadanoting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand it also tracked a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in china beginning in 1999 corresponding with the onset of the persecution of falun gong despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation china performs the secondhighest number of transplants per year kilgour and matas also presented material from chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors and transcripts of telephone interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain falun gong organs  the authors qualified their findings by noting the difficulties in verifying the alleged crimes such as independent bodies were not allowed to investigate conditions in china eyewitness evidence was difficult to obtain official information about organ transplantation was often withheld and kilgour and matas themselves were denied visas to go to china to investigate  in a january 2007 revision bloody harvest revised report into allegations of organ harvesting of falun gong practitioners in china kilgour and matas felt that the government of china had reinforced the basis of the first report by responding to it in an unpersuasive way mostly as attacks on falun gong for kilgour and matas such attacks made possible the violation of the basic human rights of falun gong practitioners  china identified two factual errors in the first version of the reportone in an appendix in a caption heading where kilgour and matas placed two chinese cities in the wrong provinces the authors dismissed those errors as have nothing to do with the analysis or conclusions of their report  in the absence of evidence that would invalidate the organ harvesting allegations  such as a chinese government registry showing the identity of every organ donor and donation  kilgour and matas concluded that the allegations of chinas harvesting organs from live falun gong practitioners were true and the practice was ongoing they called for a ban on canadian citizens traveling to china for transplant operations    as of november 2014 the report has been translated into 21 languages  in 2009 kilgour and matas published an updated version of the report as a book titled bloody harvestthe killing of falun gong for their organs it contains new material and interviews and is in two parts the first section sets out the evidence the second section details the reactions the final report received and the advocacy matas and kilgour undertook to end the abuse that they conclusively identified   that year kilgour and matas also received the 2009 human rights award by the germanbased international society for human rights  and were nominated for the 2010 nobel peace prize  in 2012 state organs transplant abuse in china edited by david matas and torsten trey was published with contributions from a dozen specialists   the reports allegations of involuntary organ removal from falun gong adherents received considerable media coverage particularly in canada europe and australia several governments tightened transplant tourism practices and requested more information from the chinese government chinese officials repeatedly and angrily denied the reports organ harvesting allegations   upon release of the initial report china declared they abided by world health organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors and denounced the report amnesty international in 2006 said it was continuing to analyze sources of information about the allegations  david ownby a professor of history at of the university of montreal and expert on falun gong wrote in falun gong and the future of china that falun gong practitioners were probable candidates for organ harvesting in chinese prisons however he felt that falun gong spokespersons overplayed their hand with the concentration camp allegations potentially losing credibility in the eyes of neutral observers despite the real persecution they were suffering  a congressional research service report by thomas lum said that the report relies on logical inferences and telephone call transcripts which he suggested may not be credible  glen mcgregor of the ottawa citizen was skeptical about the logistical plausibility of the allegations after visiting sujiatun at the invitation of the chinese medical association he said that depending on who you believe the kilgourmatas report is either compelling evidence that proves the claims about falun gong  or a collection of conjecture and inductive reasoning that fails to support its own conclusions  some observors found the report and its figures plausible tom treasure of guys hospital london said the kilgourmatas report was plausible from a medical standpoint based on the numerical gap in the number of transplants and the short waiting times in china compared with other countries  he noted the existence of blood tests of imprisoned falun gong followers which is not useful for the victims but is critical to organ donation and said the allegations were credible nonfiction writer scott carney included the allegations in his book the red market writing no one is saying the chinese government went after the falun gong specifically for their organs but it seems to have been a remarkably convenient and profitable way to dispose of them dangerous political dissidents were executed while their organs created a comfortable revenue stream for hospitals and surgeons and presumably many important chinese officials received organs  using different research methods to kilgour and matas ethan gutmann adjunct fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies found that his estimate of the number of falun gong practitioners killed for organs of approximately 65000 was close to the estimate of 62250 by kilgour and matas       in september 2014 he published his findings in the slaughter mass killings organ harvesting and chinas secret solution to its dissident problem  kirk c allison associate director of the program in human rights and medicine in the university of minnesota wrote that the short time frame of an ondemand system as in china requires a large pool of donors pretyped for blood group and hla matching and would be consistent with the falun gong allegations about the systematic tissue typing of practitioners held prisoner  he wrote that the time constraints involved cannot be assured on a randomdeath basis and that physicians he queried about the matter indicated that they were selecting live prisoners to ensure quality and compatibility  the us national kidney foundation said they were deeply concerned about recent allegations regarding the procurement of organs and tissues through coercive or exploitative practices and that any act which calls the ethical practice of donation and transplantation into question should be condemned by the worldwide transplantation community   a 2008 petition signed by 140 canadian physicians urged the canadian government to issue travel advisories warning canadians that organ transplants in china are sourced almost entirely from nonconsenting people whether prisoners sentenced to death or falun gong practitioners   canadian member of parliament borys wrzesnewskyj based on the findings of the kilgourmatas report introduced a 2008 bill that would make it illegal for canadians to get an organ transplant abroad if the organ was taken from an unwilling victim  in 2013 doctors against forced organ harvesting dafoh presented a petition of nearly 15 million signatures including over 300000 from europe to the office of un high commissioner on human rights in geneva   while russia along with china banned the report  taiwan condemned in the strongest possible terms chinas harvesting of human organs from executed falun gong practitioners  taiwans department of health urged taiwanese doctors to not encourage patients to get commercial organ transplants in mainland china  rabbi yosef shalom eliashiv prohibited jews from deriving any benefit from chinese organ harvesting even in lifethreatening situations other rabbis opposed the use of chinese organs for transplants  in 2006 and 2008 united nations special rapporteurs raised questions about the sources of organs the short waiting times for finding perfectly matched organs and the correlation between the sudden increase in organ transplants in china and the beginning of the persecution of falun gong practitioners these requests were not satisfactorily addressed by the chinese authorities  in november 2008 the united nations committee against torture noted its concern at the allegations and called for china to immediately conduct or commission an independent investigation of the claims and take measures to ensure that those responsible for such abuses are prosecuted and punished  in 2010 though the chinese medical society had stated that organ transplants from executed prisoners must cease  and changes in chinese regulations prohibited transplant tourism  a meeting of the transplantation society received over 30 papers containing data from several hundred transplants where the donor source was likely executed prisoners  during the un human rights council meeting held on march 12 2014 annetamara lorre the canadian representative on human rights to the united nations raised the issue of organ harvesting in china we remain concerned that falun gong practitioners and other religious worshippers in china face persecution and reports that organ transplants take place without free and informed consent of the donor are troubling

V scent glands are exocrine glands found in most mammals they produce semiviscous secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds these odormessengers indicate information such as status territorial marking mood and sexual power  the odor may be subliminalnot consciously detectable   though it is not their primary function the salivary glands may also function as scent glands in some animals   the eventoed ungulates artiodactyla have many specialized skin glands the secretions of which are involved in semiochemical communication  these glands include the sudoriferous glands located on the forehead between the antlers and eyes the preorbital glands extending from the medial canthus of each eye the nasal glands located inside the nostrils the interdigital glands located between the toes the preputial gland located inside the foreskin of the penis the metatarsal glands located outside of the hind legs and the tarsal glands located inside of the hind legs  like many other species of artiodactyla deer have seven major external scent glands distributed throughout their bodies  deer rely heavily on these scent glands to communicate with other members of their species and possibly even with members of other species for example male whitetailed deer odocoileus virginianus are often seen working over a scrape first the animal scrapes at the dirt with its hooves depositing the scent from his interdigital gland on the ground after that he may bite the tip off an overhanging branch depositing secretions from his salivary glands onto the branch he may then rub his face on the overhanging branch depositing secretions from the sudoriferous and preorbital glands on it  the tarsal gland appears to operate by a different mechanism than the other external scent glands a behavior called ruburination is central to this mechanism during ruburination the animal squats while urinating so that urine will run down the insides of its legs and onto its tarsal glands the tarsal glands have a tuft of hair which is specially adapted to extract certain chemical compounds from the animals urine for example in the blacktailed deer odocoileus hemionus columbianus the major constituent of the tarsal gland secretion is a lipid z6dodecen4olide this compound does not originate in the tarsal gland itself but rather it is extracted from the animals urine by the tarsal hair tuft during the ruburination process in whitetailed deer the presence and concentration of certain chemical compounds in the urine depend on the season gender reproductive status and social rank of the animals this fact along with the observation of ruburination behavior in this animal at least in the male indicates that urine probably plays a role in olfactory communication in deer

V the stomach is a muscular hollow dilated part of the digestive system which functions as an important organ of the digestive tract in many animals including vertebrates echinoderms insects midgut and molluscs it is involved in the second phase of digestion following mastication chewing in most vertebrates the stomach is located between the esophagus and the small intestine it secretes proteindigesting enzymes called proteases and gastric acid to aid in food digestion through smooth muscular contractions before sending partially digested food chyme to the small intestines   the stomach lies between the esophagus and the duodenum the first part of the small intestine it is in the left upper part of the abdominal cavity the top of the stomach lies against the diaphragm lying behind the stomach is the pancreas a large double fold of visceral peritoneum called the greater omentum hangs down from the greater curvature of the stomach two sphincters keep the contents of the stomach contained the lower esophageal sphincter found in the cardiac region at the junction of the oesophagus and stomach and the pyloric sphincter at the junction of the stomach with the duodenum the stomach is surrounded by parasympathetic stimulant and orthosympathetic inhibitor plexuses networks of blood vessels and nerves in the anterior gastric posterior superior and inferior celiac and myenteric which regulate both the secretions activity and the motor motion activity of its muscles in adult humans the stomach has a relaxed near empty volume of about 45 to 75 milliliters  because it is a distensible organ it normally expands to hold about one litre of food  the stomach of a newborn human baby will only be able to retain about 30 milliliters in classical anatomy the stomach is divided into four sections beginning at the cardia  each of which has different cells and functions the lesser curvature of the stomach is supplied by the right gastric artery inferiorly and the left gastric artery superiorly which also supplies the cardiac region the greater curvature is supplied by the right gastroomental artery inferiorly and the left gastroomental artery superiorly the fundus of the stomach and also the upper portion of the greater curvature is supplied by the short gastric artery which arises from the splenic artery like the other parts of the gastrointestinal tract the stomach walls consist of an outer mucosa and inner submucosa muscularis externa and serosa the gastric mucosa of the stomach consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria composed of loose connective tissue with a thin layer of smooth muscle called the muscularis mucosae separating it from the submucosa beneath the submucosa lies under the mucosa and consists of fibrous connective tissue separating the mucosa from the next layer meissners plexus is in this layer the muscularis externa lies beneath the submucosa and is unique from other organs of the gastrointestinal tract consisting of three layers the stomach also possesses a serosa consisting of layers of connective tissue continuous with the peritoneum different types of cells are found at the different layers of the gastric glands cardiac glands at cardia pyloric glands at pylorus fundic glands at fundus a bolus a small rounded mass of chewed up food enters the stomach through the esophagus via the lower esophageal sphincter the stomach releases proteases proteindigesting enzymes such as pepsin and hydrochloric acid which kills or inhibits bacteria and provides the acidic ph of two for the proteases to work food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis  reducing the volume of the fundus before looping around the fundus  and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme partially digested food chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine where the extraction of nutrients begins depending on the quantity and contents of the meal the stomach will digest the food into chyme anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours the average human stomach can comfortably hold about a litre of food gastric juice in the stomach also contains pepsinogen hydrochloric acid activates this inactive form of enzyme into the active formpepsin pepsin breaks down proteins into polypeptides although the absorption is mainly a function of the small intestine some absorption of certain small molecules nevertheless does occur in the stomach through its lining this includes the parietal cells of the stomach are responsible for producing intrinsic factor which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin b12 b12 is used in cellular metabolism and is necessary for the production of red blood cells and the functioning of the nervous system the movement and the flow of chemicals into the stomach are controlled by both the autonomic nervous system and by the various digestive system hormones other than gastrin these hormones all act to turn off the stomach action this is in response to food products in the liver and gall bladder which have not yet been absorbed the stomach needs to push food into the small intestine only when the intestine is not busy while the intestine is full and still digesting food the stomach acts as storage for food epidermal growth factor egf results in cellular proliferation differentiation and survival  egf is a lowmolecularweight polypeptide first purified from the mouse submandibular gland but since then found in many human tissues including submandibular gland parotid gland salivary egf which seems also regulated by dietary inorganic iodine plays also an important physiological role in the maintenance of orooesophageal and gastric tissue integrity the biological effects of salivary egf include healing of oral and gastroesophageal ulcers inhibition of gastric acid secretion stimulation of dna synthesis as well as mucosal protection from intraluminal injurious factors such as gastric acid bile acids pepsin and trypsin and to physical chemical and bacterial agents  the stomach can taste sodium glutamate using glutamate receptors  and this information is passed to the lateral hypothalamus and limbic system in the brain as a palatability signal through the vagus nerve  the stomach can also sense independently to tongue and oral taste receptors glucose  carbohydrates  proteins  and fats  this allows the brain to link nutritional value of foods to their tastes  a large number of studies have indicated that most cases of peptic ulcers gastritis and stomach cancer are caused by helicobacter pylori infection the stomach has to regenerate a new layer of mucus every two weeks or else damage to the epithelium may result many bariatric surgery procedures involve the stomach in order to lose weight a gastric band may be placed around the cardia area which can adjust to limit intake the anatomy of the stomach may be modified or the stomach may be bypassed entirely surgical removal of the stomach is called a gastrectomy and removal of the cardia area is a called a cardiactomy cardiectomy is a term that is also used to describe removal of the heart    the former procedure may be carried out because of gastric cancer or severe perforation of the stomach wall there were previously conflicting statements in the academic anatomy community    over whether the cardia is part of the stomach part of the esophagus or a distinct entity modern surgical and medical textbooks have agreed that the gastric cardia is now clearly considered to be part of the stomach   the word stomach is derived from the latin stomachus which is derived from the greek word stomachos \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 ultimately from stoma \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 mouth  the words gastro and gastric meaning related to the stomach are both derived from the greek word gaster \u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 meaning belly    although the precise shape and size of the stomach varies widely among different vertebrates the relative positions of the esophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant as a result the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter however lampreys hagfishes chimaeras lungfishes and some teleost fish have no stomach at all with the esophagus opening directly into the anus these animals all consume diets that either require little storage of food or no predigestion with gastric juices or both  the gastric lining is usually divided into two regions an anterior portion lined by fundic glands and a posterior with pyloric glands cardiac glands are unique to mammals and even then are absent in a number of species the distributions of these glands vary between species and do not always correspond with the same regions as in man furthermore in many nonhuman mammals a portion of the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the esophagus ruminants in particular have a complex stomach the first three chambers of which are all lined with esophageal mucosa  in birds and crocodilians the stomach is divided into two regions anteriorly is a narrow tubular region the proventriculus lined by fundic glands and connecting the true stomach to the crop beyond lies the powerful muscular gizzard lined by pyloric glands and in some species containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food  greater omentum and stomach stomach a more realistic image

V artificial kidney is often a synonym for hemodialysis but may also more generally refer to renal replacement therapies with exclusion of kidney transplantation that are in use andor in development this article deals with bioengineered kidneysbioartificial kidneys that are grown from renal cell linesrenal tissue   kidneys are paired vital organs located behind the abdominal cavity at about the level of the bottom of the ribcage corresponding to the levels t12l3 of the spine vertebrae they perform about a dozen physiologic functions and are fairly easily damaged some of these functions include filtration and excretion of metabolic waste products regulation of necessary electrolytes fluids stimulation of red blood cellproduction  these organs routinely filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood a day to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine composed of wastes and extra fluid  kidney failure results in the slow accumulation of nitrogenous wastes salts water and disruption of the bodys normal ph balance this failure commonly occurs over a long period of time and is commonly known as end stage renal disease esrd detecting kidney disease before the kidneys start to shut down is uncommon with high blood pressure and decreased appetite being the sort of symptoms that indicate a problem  until the second world war kidney failure generally meant death for the patient several insights into kidney function and acute kidney failure were made during the war not least of which would be bywaters and bealls descriptions of pigmentinduced nephropathy drawn from their clinical experiences during the london blitz  over 300000 americans are dependent on hemodialysis as treatment for kidney failure but according to data from the 2005 usrds 452000 americans have endstage kidney disease eskd  intriguing investigations from groups in london ontario and toronto ontario have suggested that dialysis treatments lasting two to three times as long as and delivered more frequently than conventional thrice weekly treatments may be associated with improved clinical outcomes  implementing sixtimes weekly allnight dialysis would overwhelm existing resources in most countries this as well as scarcity of donor organs for kidney transplantation has prompted research in developing alternative therapies including the development of a wearable or implantable device  hemodialysis is a method for removing waste products such as creatinine and ureaas well as free water from the blood when the kidneys are in kidney failure the mechanical device used to clean the patients blood is called a dialyser also known as an artificial kidney the other name for artificial kidney is also called a dialysis machine modern dialysers typically consist of a cylindrical rigid casing enclosing hollow fibers cast or extruded from a polymer or copolymer which is usually a proprietary formulation the combined area of the hollow fibers is typically between 12 square meters intensive research has been conducted by many groups to optimize blood and dialysate flows within the dialyser in order to achieve efficient transfer of wastes from blood to dialysate a wearable artificial kidney is a wearable dialysis machine that a person with endstage kidney disease could use daily or even continuously until november 2008 no wearable kidney was widely available but many research teams were in the process of developing such devices now the scientists have built an artificial device which can be fitted in the failed kidney the fda has approved the first human clinical trials in the united states for a wearable artificial kidney designed by blood purification technologies inc of beverly hills california it is a tubelike structure which allows the impure blood to be passed through it and the inserted fluids purify the blood which is not pure and the byproducts are allowed to pass through the ureter and out of the body currently no viable bioengineered kidneys exist although a great deal of research is underway numerous barriers exist to their creation    however manufacturing a membrane that mimics the kidneys ability to filter blood and subsequently excrete toxins while reabsorbing water and salt would allow for a wearable andor implantable artificial kidney developing a membrane using microelectromechanical systems mems technology is a limiting step in creating an implantable bioartificial kidney the biomems and renal nanotechnology laboratories at the cleveland clinics lerner research institute have focused on advancing membrane technology to develop an implantable or wearable therapy for endstage kidney disease eskd current dialysis cartridges are too large and require superphysiologic pressures for blood circulation and pores in current polymer membranes have too broad of a size distribution and irregular features manufacturing a silicon nanoporous membrane with narrow pore size distributions improves the membranes ability to discriminate between filtered and retained molecules it also increases hydraulic permeability by allowing the mean pore size to approach the desired cutoff of the membrane using a batchfabrication process allows for strict control over pore size distribution and geometry  in recent studies human kidney cells were harvested from donated organs unsuitable for transplantation and grown on these membranes the cultured cells covered the membranes and appear to retain features of adult kidney cells the differentiated growth of renal epithelial cells on mems materials suggests that a miniaturized device suitable for implantation may be feasible a ucsfled effort to create an implantable artificial kidney for dialysis patients has been selected as one of the first projects to undergo more timely and collaborative review at the food and drug administration the fda announced on april 9 2012 that it had chosen three renal device projects to pilot a new regulatory approval program called innovation pathway 20 intended to bring breakthrough medical device technologies to patients faster and more efficiently the artificial kidney project which is targeted for clinical trials in 2017 was selected for its transformative potential in treating end stage kidney disease and for its potential to benefit from early interactions with the fda in the approval process the fda effort will involve close contact between the federal agency and device developers early in the development process to identify and address potential scientific and regulatory hurdles and create a roadmap for project approval the goal is to improve the projects overall chance of success while reducing the time and cost of fda review and maintaining safety lessons the agency said will inform approvals in other areas

V male lactation in zoology means production of milk from mammary glands in the presence of physiological stimuli connected with nursing infants it is well documented in the dayak fruit bat the term male lactation is not used in human medicine it has been used in popular literature such as louise erdrichs the antelope wife to describe the phenomenon of male galactorrhea which is a well documented condition in humans newborn babies of both sexes can occasionally produce milk this is called neonatal milk also known as witchs milk and not considered male lactation male lactation was of some interest to alexander von humboldt who reports in voyage aux régions équinoxiales du nouveau continent of a citizen of the village arenas close to cumana who allegedly nurtured his son for three months when his wife was ill  as well as charles darwin who commented on it in the descent of man and selection in relation to sex 1871 it is well known that in the males of all mammals including man rudimentary mammae exist these in several instances have become well developed and have yielded a copious supply of milk their essential identity in the two sexes is likewise shown by their occasional sympathetic enlargement in both during an attack of the measles  darwin later considered the nearly perfect function of male nipples in contrast to greatly reduced structures such as the vesicula prostatica speculating that both sexes may have nursed young in early mammalian ancestors and subsequently mammals evolved to inactivate them in males at an early age    male mammals of many species have been observed to lactate under unusual or pathogenic conditions such as extreme stress castration and exposure to phytoestrogens or pituitary tumors therefore it is hypothesized that while most male mammals could easily develop the ability to lactate there is no selective advantage to male lactation while male mammals could in theory improve offsprings survival rate through the additional nourishment provided by lactation most have developed other strategies to increase the number of surviving offspring such as mating with additional partners presently very few species are known where male lactation occurs and it is not well understood what evolutionary factors control the development of this trait  the phenomenon of male lactation occurs in some other species notably the dayak fruit bat dyacopterus spadiceus and the lactating males may assist in the nursing of their infants in addition male goats are known to lactate on occasion  in rare cases male cats have been known to lactate in response to stimulation by a kitten especially if the male has been neutered  the phenomenon of successful human male breastfeeding has been credibly observed in several cases  however the cases are not sufficiently documented to allow distinguishing of possible pathologic galactorrhea

V decellularized homografts are donated human heart valves which have been modified via tissue engineering several techniques exist for decellularisation with the majority based on detergent or enzymatic protocols which aim to eliminate all donor cells while preserving the mechanical properties of the remaining matrix   aortic valve disease affects the valve between the left ventricle and the aorta and can be present as a congenital condition at birth or caused by other factors several therapeutic options are open to patients once the indication for aortic valve replacement has been confirmed one option is replacement using a mechanical valve this however necessitates a strict lifelong anticoagulation regime to avoid cerebral thromboembolism these blood thinners hold an inherent risk for severe bleeding episodes which affects both professional and leisure activities and the majority of patients opt against mechanical valves for this reason biological prostheses ie pericardial heart valves of animal origin xenogenic offer a viable alternative however in particular for young patients it has been found that xenogenic valves not provide satisfactory durability and rapid valve degeneration can occur within months  a further avenue open to patients is a socalled ross operation an extensive surgical procedure in which the diseased aortic valve is replaced by the patients pulmonary valve autograft the pulmonary valve then needs to be replaced by a heart valve prosthesis a drawback of this method is that it can frequently result in a twovalve diseased heart as almost all autografts are impaired by progressive dilatation in the long term and the pulmonary valve prosthesis often a conventional cryopreserved homograft is subject to the same rate of degeneration as all biological valves this can thereby leading to frequent reoperations  which have a substantially higher mortality rate due to postoperative adhesions  the lack of durable heart valve prostheses for young patients has driven forward research in tissue engineering approaches for valve replacement current tissueengineering concepts are based on either artificial polymeric or biological scaffolds derived from donated human tissue allogenic or animals xenogenic while more readily available there have been reports of dramatic failure in the use of xenogeneic matrices in paediatric patients leading to scepticism regarding their application  total artificial tissueengineered heart valve concepts are currently under development and would solve many unmet clinical demands such as the permanent availability of different sizes and lengths these concepts have shown good results in the technical implementation of valved polymeric conduit production and have successfully been used for in vitro and in vivo seeding of different stem cell lines however preclinical testing in longterm animal models has yet to deliver satisfactory results due to a lack of mechanical leading to early failure of valvular function  aortic valve replacement using a homograft was first performed over 50 years ago on 24 july 1962 by donald ross at guys hospital london and has been assessed in prospective randomized studies eg in comparison to the ross procedure  aortic valve replacement using conventional cryopreserved homografts is currently performed only in about 3 of all patients mostly to treat acute aortic valve endocarditis1 severe calcification of conventional homografts frequently occurs and is the main reason for its restrictive use however current guidelines confirm homografts as a valid alternative for young patients requiring anatomical reconstruction of the outflow tract decellularised aortic homografts dah for aortic valve replacement and decellularised pulmonary valves dph for pulmonary valve replacement have been developed by several groups and companies over the last decade dph have been clinically implanted since 2002 in paediatric patients and have shown excellent early to midterm clinical performance challenging conventional cryopreserved homografts as the gold standard for pulmonary valve replacement in congenital heart disease  dah developed at hannover medical school mhh have shown sufficient mechanical stability for the systemic circulation at the greatest possible extent of antigen elimination and have been validated in longterm animal models  no dilatation has been observed at the different level such as the valve ring plane in the sinuses or at the level of the sinutubular junction haemodynamic performance in terms of effective orifice area of dah was outstanding compared to all other options and no calcification of the dah has been observed to date in the few cases in which a long valved homograft had to be implanted due to concomitant dilatation of the ascending aorta there was also no dilatation of the homograft   two prospective clinical trials funded by the european union are currently underway to further evaluate this new approach

V the lateral postcentral gyrus is a prominent structure in the parietal lobe of the human brain it is the location of the primary somatosensory cortex the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch like other sensory areas there is a map of sensory space in this location called the sensory homunculus the primary somatosensory cortex was initially defined from surface stimulation studies of wilder penfield and parallel surface potential studies of bard woolsey and marshall although initially defined to be roughly the same as brodmann areas 3 1 and 2 more recent work by kaas has suggested that for homogeny with other sensory fields only area 3 should be referred to as primary somatosensory cortex as it receives the bulk of the thalamocortical projections from the sensory input fields at the primary somatosensory cortex tactile representation is orderly arranged in an inverted fashion from the toe at the top of the cerebral hemisphere to mouth at the bottom however some body parts may be controlled by partially overlapping regions of cortex each cerebral hemisphere of the primary somatosensory cortex only contains a tactile representation of the opposite contralateral side of the body the amount of primary somatosensory cortex devoted to a body part is not proportional to the absolute size of the body surface but instead to the relative density of cutaneous tactile receptors on that body part the density of cutaneous tactile receptors on a body part is generally indicative of the degree of sensitivity of tactile stimulation experienced at said body part for this reason the human lip and hands have a larger representation than other body parts   the lateral postcentral gyrus is bounded by brodmann areas 3 1 and 2 make up the primary somatosensory cortex of the human brain or s1 because brodmann sliced the brain somewhat obliquely he encountered area 1 first however from anterior to posterior the brodmann designations are 3 1 and 2 respectively brodmann area ba 3 is subdivided into areas 3a and 3b where ba 1 occupies the apex of the postcentral gyrus the rostral border of ba 3a is in the nadir of the central sulcus and is caudally followed by ba 3b then ba 1 with ba 2 following and ending in the nadir of the postcentral sulcus ba 3b is now conceived as the primary somatosensory cortex because 1 it receives dense inputs from the np nucleus of the thalamus 2 its neurons are highly responsive to somatosensory stimuli but not other stimuli 3 lesions here impair somatic sensation and 4 electrical stimulation evokes somatic sensory experience ba 3a also receives dense input from the thalamus however this area is concerned with proprioception areas 1 and 2 receive dense inputs from ba 3b the projection from 3b to 1 primarily relays texture information the projection to area 2 emphasizes size and shape lesions confined to these areas produce predictable dysfunction in texture size and shape discrimination somatosensory cortex like other neocortex is layered like other sensory cortex ie visual and auditory the thalamic inputs project into layer iv which in turn project into other layers as in other sensory cortices s1 neurons are grouped together with similar inputs and responses into vertical columns that extend across cortical layers eg as shown by vernon mountcastle into alternating layers of slowly adapting and rapidly adapting neurons or spatial segmentation of the vibrissae on mouserat cerebral cortex this area of cortex as shown by wilder penfield and others is organized somatotopically having the pattern of a homunculus that is the legs and trunk fold over the midline the arms and hands are along the middle of the area shown here and the face is near the bottom of the figure while it is not wellshown here the lips and hands are enlarged on a proper homunculus since a larger number of neurons in the cerebral cortex are devoted to processing information from these areas the positions of brodmann areas 3 1 and 2 are  from the nadir of the central sulcus toward the apex of the postcentral gyrus  3a 3b 1 and 2 respectively these areas contain cells that project to the secondary somatosensory cortex lesions affecting the primary somatosensory cortex produce characteristic symptoms including agraphesthesia astereognosia hemihypesthesia and loss of vibration proprioception and fine touch because the thirdorder neuron of the mediallemniscal pathway cannot synapse in the cortex it can also produce hemineglect if it affects the nondominant hemisphere destruction of brodmann area 3 1 and 2 results in contralateral hemihypesthesia and astereognosis it could also reduce nociception thermoception and crude touch but since information from the spinothalamic tract is interpreted mainly by other areas of the brain see insular cortex and cingulate gyrus it is not as relevant as the other symptoms  lateral surface of left cerebral hemisphere viewed from the side drawing to illustrate the

V   teenagers ages 1025 have been misunderstood for years their inconsistent behavior is often associated with idiocy and impulsiveness  however their behavior is explainable by hormonal imbalance a rapidly growing body and the regions of their brain that are still developing teenagers take risks because the connection between brain regions which contributes to how the brain makes decisions is still developing  a distinctive part of the teenage behavior the reckless risk taking is actually a vital part of selfdiscovery and the shaping of society   the brain is the decision making organ of the body there are two types of brain behavior reward seeking and impulse inhibition reward seeking is the ability to weigh the prize or what one can obtain over the consequences impulse inhibition is the ability to suppress desires different regions of the brain have different operations and have different receptors for hormones a hormone is a regulatory substance produced in an organism and stimulates specific cells or tissues into action  for the purpose of this article it has to be established that there is a difference between an adolescent and an adult in western civilization adults and children have vastly different responsibilities some cultures and social arrangements do not recognize a definitive transformation before and after puberty in biology an adolescent is someone between the ages of 10 and 25 because this marks a period when the brain is still maturing the terms teenager and adolescent are used interchangeably throughout this article as a way of identifying the ages where the brain is not fully developed teenager will specifically be used when speaking about the distinctive risk taking behavior that is seen during the teenage years of 12 to 17  as we get older the regions of our brain that link memory and experience into decision making get stronger our problem solving and decision making improves because the frontal areas allow us to generate and weigh far more variables and agendas than before  since a teenagers brain is still developing these previously mentioned regions are still meshing this explains teenagers inconsistent behavior and their ability to fluctuate between rational and irresponsible decisions  during the adolescent years the development of the reward regions of the brain and the regions responsible for rational consideration and judgment become disconnected due to puberty one of the responsible regions is the ventral striatum is a brain module area of the brain that is active when a person receives or expects an award adolescents are extremely reactive to awards because within this brain region their bodies produce an abundance of the gonadal hormones which makes them more desirable of rewards  teenagers take more risks than adults because this area of their brain is more stimulated  the importance of social rewards is reflective in the teenagers hormones oxytocin is a brain hormone teens have an abundance of which makes social connections rewarding  therefore risk taking in teens is induced by social reward another hormone that is relevant to social rewards is testosterone puberty in boys is marked by an increase in testosterone levels testosterone is in abundance when the ventral striatum becomes activated after highrisk gambles in this section of development the pubertal testosterone is a strong prediction of statusrelevant motivation and behavior  this means that the teenage body responds aggressively to social reward only when a teenager is within a social environment where their social status is threatened do researchers see the aggressive effect derived from testosterone an example of this can be seen in a teenagers driving environment when a teenager drives alone they follow the speed limit but when they are with friends they speed and put themselves in danger so they will not be seen as cowardly  similarly within the teenage female body when estradiol levels raise females experience weakened inhibition which lead to heightened risk taking  female teenagers too would speed when with friends because the danger does not outweigh the reward of maintaining social status a teenager can find a threat to their social status stress inducing stress can come from actions such as failing test which could decrease their class rank missing soccer practice which could cause them to lose their starting lineup spot in the next game two hormonal systems are activated when an individual experiences a stressor one releases hormones into the blood stream and activates an immediate response known as fight or flight the second releases a prolonged response caused by hpa the hpa is responsible for the physiological and behavioral responses to stress  what the brain releases at this time is responsible for increasing learning and memory abilities but prolonged exposure to these hormones can cause short and long term implications and an individuals behavior and physiology in an experiment conducted on adolescent and adult rats scientists found that hormonal stress responses lasted 45 to 60 minutes longer in adolescent rats compared to adult rats  this could explain why a teenagers brain is especially vulnerable to anxiety or psychological disease romeo stated adolescence is marked by significant shifts in hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis reactivity resulting in heightened stressinduced hormonal responses  so in comparison to an adults brain the reversibility of chronic stress effects is acutely different a teenagers brain can still suffer structural and functional shifts up to a month after healing therefore stress exists longer within the brain of a teenager compared to the brain of the adult  young people in our culture are expected to leave and experience the world for themselves and find financial independence this is explicitly explained by sercombes main idea symbolic acts of extension send a message to peers andor dominant adults in their lives as the individual is now or in the process of becoming their own person  teenagers are expected to fulfill the fundamental need to become an actor in ones life instead of a spectator he argues that teenagers are agencymachines and younger children are learningmachines  teenagers must find their own way to a community outside of their parents institution the seemingly negative behaviors of teenagers such as secrecy impulsiveness resistance subversion and deception are unavoidable because power over ones self is never given but fought for these attributes of rebellious behavior are not associated with peer pressure but instead the search for an identity  adolescents crave new and exciting things they are sensation seeking which is not based on impulsiveness but instead the hunt for the neural buzz meaning the jolt of the unusual or unexpected this explains why teens are the highest age group killed in all accidents except those that are work related and why long term drug use usually begins during adolescence  contrary to popular belief teenagers fully understand they are mortal they overestimate risk like adults but they weigh risk and reward differently as previously mentioned teenagers strongly respond to social reward and possible threats to social status  they do not give consequences an appropriate weight some examples of this irresponsibility are participating in unprotected sex or playing a football game on an already injured ankle teenagers can only see the immediate satisfaction and not the repercussions of their actions  teenagers risk taking has negative and positive effects on their lives and society the positive effects are monumental in history it is always young people who chauvinistically volunteer to serve in wars their desire to stray from home allows them to meet people with similar views  they can start a revolution against an oppressive government like college kids in the 1960s and 1970s protested the vietnam war change is often driven by young people as teenagers are given the opportunity to explore the world and test their values  their values can begin to conflict with their parents beliefs but that is important because they are adapting to the modern world and forming their own perspective by reaching out to their peers instead of their parents they are investing in the future they want to obtain their own knowledge and then find value in their parents experiences instead of a parents authority  their parents outlooks on life and morals may be irrelevant in todays world the negative effects of risk taking are destructive to adolescences future and health engaging in drugs or unprotected sex can lead to addiction or teenage pregnancy stifling identity growth health and safety  risk taking is directly correlated to teenagers brain development as their brains are still growing they value rewards more than consequences and begin acting rebellious not because of peer pressure but because they are on a quest for identity

V gastric acid is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach it is composed of hydrochloric acid hcl 0501m roughly 500010000 parts per million  potassium chloride kcl and sodium chloride nacl the acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins by activating digestive enzymes and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids gastric acid is produced by cells lining the stomach which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate a base to buffer the fluid ensuring that it does not become too acidic these cells also produce mucus which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach cells in the beginning of the small intestine or duodenum further produce large amounts of bicarbonate to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract the main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid which is produced by parietal cells also called oxyntic cells in the gastric glands in the stomach its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network called canaliculi from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach the ph of gastric acid is 15 to 35   in the human stomach lumen the acidity being maintained by the proton pump h k  atpase the parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process which causes a temporary rise of ph in the blood known as an alkaline tide the highly acidic environment in the stomach lumen causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure or denature this exposes the proteins peptide bonds the gastric chief cells of the stomach secrete enzymes for protein breakdown inactive pepsinogen and in infancy rennin hydrochloric acid activates pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin which then helps digestion by breaking the bonds linking amino acids a process known as proteolysis in addition many microorganisms have their growth inhibited by such an acidic environment which is helpful to prevent infection   gastric acid secretion happens in several steps chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi gastric acid is then secreted into the lumen of the oxyntic gland and gradually reaches the main stomach lumen the exact manner in which the secreted acid reaches the stomach lumen is controversial as acid must first cross the relatively ph neutral gastric mucus layer chloride and sodium ions are secreted actively from the cytoplasm of the parietal cell into the lumen of the canaliculus this creates a negative potential of 40 mv to 70 mv across the parietal cell membrane that causes potassium ions and a small number of sodium ions to diffuse from the cytoplasm into the parietal cell canaliculi the enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid this acid immediately dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions the hydrogen ions leave the cell through h k  atpase antiporter pumps at the same time sodium ions are actively reabsorbed this means that the majority of secreted k  and na  ions return to the cytoplasm in the canaliculus secreted hydrogen and chloride ions mix and are secreted into the lumen of the oxyntic gland the highest concentration that gastric acid reaches in the stomach is 160 mm in the canaliculi this is about 3 million times that of arterial blood but almost exactly isotonic with other bodily fluids the lowest ph of the secreted acid is 08  but the acid is diluted in the stomach lumen to a ph between 1 and 3 there is a small continuous basal secretion of gastric acid between meals of usually less than 10 meqhour  there are three phases in the secretion of gastric acid which increase the secretion rate in order to digest a meal gastric acid production is regulated by both the autonomic nervous system and several hormones the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve and the hormone gastrin stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone histamine from enterochromaffinelike cells ecl vasoactive intestinal peptide cholecystokinin and secretin all inhibit production the production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and negative feedback mechanisms four types of cells are involved in this process parietal cells g cells d cells and enterochromaffinelike cells besides this the endings of the vagus nerve cn x and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly nerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory neurotransmitters acetylcholine and gastrinreleasing peptide their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from g cells and histamine from enterochromaffinelike cells gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too by stimulating the release of histamine the release of histamine is the most important positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by somatostatin in the duodenum gastric acid is neutralized by sodium bicarbonate this also blocks gastric enzymes that have their optima in the acid range of ph the secretion of sodium bicarbonate from the pancreas is stimulated by secretin this polypeptide hormone gets activated and secreted from socalled s cells in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum when the ph in the duodenum falls below 45 to 50 the neutralization is described by the equation the carbonic acid rapidly equilibrates with carbon dioxide and water through catalysis by carbonic anhydrase enzymes bound to the gut epithelial lining  leading to a net release of carbon dioxide gas within the lumen associated with neutralisation in the absorptive upper intestine such as the

hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria there is low or no gastric acid in the stomach potentially leading to problems as the disinfectant properties of the gastric lumen are decreased in such conditions there is greater risk of infections of the digestive tract such as infection with vibrio or helicobacter bacteria in zollingerellison syndrome and hypercalcemia there are increased gastrin levels leading to excess gastric acid production which can cause gastric ulcers in diseases featuring excess vomiting patients develop hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis decreased blood acidity by h  and chlorine depletion the proton pump enzyme is the target of proton pump inhibitors used to increase gastric ph and hence decrease stomach acidity in diseases that feature excess acid h2 antagonists indirectly decrease gastric acid production antacids neutralize existing acid the role of gastric acid in digestion was established in the 1820s and 1830s by william beaumont on alexis st martin who as a result of an accident had a fistula hole in his stomach which allowed beaumont to observe the process of digestion and to extract gastric acid verifying that acid played a crucial role in digestion

V the breast is one of two prominences found on the upper ventral region of the torso of female and male primates in females it serves as the mammary gland which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants  both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues at puberty estrogens in conjunction with growth hormone cause breast development males do not develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts because their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens namely testosterone which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing breast tissue the breasts of females are typically far more prominent than those of males subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge to the nipple and these tissues give the breast its size and shape at the ends of the ducts are lobules or clusters of alveoli where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals  during pregnancy the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones including estrogens progesterone and prolactin that mediate the completion of its development namely lobuloalveolar maturation in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding upon childbirth the alveoli are stimulated to produce and secrete milk for infants along with their function in feeding infants female breasts have social and sexual characteristics breasts have been featured in notable ancient and modern sculpture art and photography female breasts can figure prominently in a womans perception of her body image and sexual attractiveness a number of western cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts as immodest or indecent breasts and especially the nipples are an erogenous zone on women given the emphasis of some cultures on breast size and attractiveness some women seek breast augmentation or other kinds of surgery to enlarge or reduce their breast size or to reverse sagging breasts   the english word breast derives from the old english word br\u0113ost breast bosom from protogermanic breustam breast from the protoindoeuropean base bhreus to swell to sprout  the breast spelling conforms to the scottish and north english dialectal pronunciations  in women the breasts overlay the pectoralis major muscles and usually extend from the level of the second rib to the level of the sixth rib in the front of the human rib cage thus the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls at the front of the chest the breast tissue can extend from the clavicle collarbone to the middle of the sternum breastbone at the sides of the chest the breast tissue can extend into the axilla armpit and can reach as far to the back as the latissimus dorsi muscle extending from the lower back to the humerus bone the longest bone of the upper arm as a mammary gland the breast is composed of layers of different types of tissue among which predominate two types adipose tissue and glandular tissue which effects the lactation functions of the breasts    morphologically the breast is a cone with the base at the chest wall and the apex is at the nipple the center of the nippleareola complex the super\ufb01cial tissue layer superficial fascia is separated from the skin by 0525cm of subcutaneous fat adipose tissue the suspensory coopers ligaments are fibroustissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope the female adult breast contains 1418 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge at the nipple milk exits the breast through the nipple which is surrounded by a pigmented area of skin called the areola the size of the areola can vary widely among women the areola contains modified sweat glands known as montgomerys glands these glands secrete oily fluid that lubricate and protect the nipple during breastfeeding  volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for newborn appetite  the 2045mm milk ducts are immediately surrounded with dense connective tissue that support the glands the glandular tissue of the breast is biochemically supported with estrogen when a woman ceases menstruation and her body estrogen levels decrease breast atrophy occurs  milk gland tissue atrophies withers and disappears resulting in a breast composed of adipose tissue super\ufb01cial fascia suspensory ligaments and the skin envelope  the dimensions and weight of the breast vary widely among women ranging from approximately 500 to 1000 grams 11 to 22 pounds each a smalltomediumsized breast weighs 500grams 11 pounds or less and a large breast can weighs approximately 750 to 1000 grams 17 to 22 pounds or more the tissue composition ratios of the breast also vary among women some womens breasts have varying proportions of glandular tissue than of adipose or connective tissues the fattoconnectivetissue ratio determines the density or firmness of the breast during a womans life her breasts change size shape and weight due to hormonal bodily changes during puberty fertility pregnancy breastfeeding and menopause   the breast is an apocrine gland that produces milk to feed an infant child for which the nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola nippleareola complex the skin color of which varies from pink to dark brown and has many sebaceous glands the basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units tdlus which produce the fatty breast milk they give the breast its offspringfeeding functions as a mammary gland they are distributed throughout the body of the breast approximately twothirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30mm of the base of the nipple the terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from tdlus into 418 lactiferous ducts which drain to the nipple the milkglandstofat ratio is 21 in a lactating woman and 11 in a nonlactating woman in addition to the milk glands the breast also is composed of connective tissues collagen elastin white fat and the suspensory coopers ligaments sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front anterior and side lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth the fifth and the sixth intercostal nerves while the t4 nerve thoracic spinal nerve 4 which innervates the dermatomic area supplies sensation to the nippleareola complex  approximately 75 of the lymph from the breast travels to the axillary lymph nodes on the same side of the body whilst 25 of the lymph travels to the parasternal nodes beside the sternum bone   a small amount of remaining lymph travels to the other breast and to the abdominal lymph nodes the axillary lymph nodes include the pectoral chest subscapular under the scapula and humeral humerusbone area lymphnode groups which drain to the central axillary lymph nodes and to the apical axillary lymph nodes the lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to oncology because breast cancer is a cancer common to the mammary gland and cancer cells can metastasize break away from a tumour and be dispersed to other parts of the body by means of the lymphatic system the morphologic variations in the size shape volume tissue density pectoral locale and spacing of the breasts determine their natural shape appearance and position on a womans chest breast size and other characteristics do not predict the fattomilkgland ratio or the potential for the woman to nurse an infant child the size and the shape of the breasts are influenced by normallife hormonal changes thelarche menstruation pregnancy menopause and medical conditions eg virginal breast hypertrophy  the shape of the breasts is naturally determined by the support of the suspensory coopers ligaments the underlying muscle and bone structures of the chest and the skin envelope the suspensory ligaments sustain the breast from the clavicle collarbone and the clavicopectoral fascia collarbone and chest by traversing and encompassing the fat and milkgland tissues the breast is positioned affixed to and supported upon the chest wall while its shape is established and maintained by the skin envelope  while it has been a common belief that breastfeeding causes breasts to sag  researchers have found that a womans breasts sag due to four key factors cigarette smoking the number of pregnancies gravity and weight gain and loss  the base of each breast is attached to the chest by the deep fascia over the pectoralis major muscles the space between the breast and the pectoralis major muscle is called retromammary space and gives mobility to the breast some breasts are mounted high upon the chest wall are of rounded shape and project almost horizontally from the chest which features are common to girls and women in the early stages of thelarchic development the sprouting of the breasts in the highbreast configuration the domeshaped and the coneshaped breast is affixed to the chest at the base and the weight is evenly distributed over the base area in the lowbreast configuration a proportion of the breast weight is supported by the chest against which rests the lower surface of the breast thus is formed the inframammary fold imf because the base is deeply affixed to the chest the weight of the breast is distributed over a greater area and so reduces the weightbearing strain upon the chest shoulder and back muscles that bear the weight of the bust  the chest thoracic cavity progressively slopes outwards from the thoracic inlet atop the breastbone and above to the lowest ribs that support the breasts the inframammary fold where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest is an anatomic feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest the imf is the lowermost extent of the anatomic breast in the course of thelarche some girls develop breasts the lower skinenvelope of which touches the chest below the imf and some girls do not both breast anatomies are statistically normal morphologic variations of the size and shape of womens breasts  up to 25 of womens breasts display a persistent visible breast asymmetry   which is defined as differing in size by at least one cup size for about 5 to 10 of women their breasts are severely different with the left breast being larger in 62 of cases  this is due to the left breasts proximity to the heart a greater number of arteries and veins and a protective layer of fat surrounding the heart located beneath it the most common cause for asymmetric breast density is the common normal variant of asymmetrically distributed breast tissue minor asymmetry may be resolved by wearing a padded bra but in severe cases of developmental breast deformitycommonly called amazons syndrome by physiciansmay require corrective surgery due to morphological alterations caused by variations in shape volume position of the breasts relative to the inframammary fold the nippleareola complex on the chest or both   if a woman is uncomfortable with her breasts asymmetry and the difference is relatively minor she can minimize the difference with a corrective or padded bra or use gel bra inserts if the difference is significant this can indicate that the woman should consult a doctor to establish the cause breast asymmetry is related to several known risk factors for breast cancer  but only 3 of mammograms of women with asymmetrical breasts result in a cancer diagnosis  types of breast asymmetry include bilateral asymmetric hypertrophy unilateral hypertrophy with normal contralateral breast unilateral hypertrophy with amastia or hypoplasia of the contralateral side unilateral amastia or hypoplasia with normal contralateral breast asymmetric bilateral hypoplasia and unilateral mammary ptosis  most surgeons will only perform an augmentation procedure to treat asymmetry if the womans breasts differ by at least one cup size options include a minimally invasive procedure known as platelet injection fat transfer which transfers fat cells from the womans thighs to her smaller breast more invasive procedures include reduction or augmentation mammoplasty such as mastopexy breast reduction plasty or breast augmentation depending on the nature of the asymmetry it may be necessary to operate on one or both breasts   the morphological structure of the human breast is identical in males and females until puberty for a girl in puberty during thelarche the breastdevelopment stage the female sex hormones principally estrogens in conjunction with growth hormone promote the sprouting growth and development of the breasts in the course of which as mammary glands they grow in size and volume and rest on her chest these development stages of secondary sex characteristics breasts pubic hair etc are illustrated in the fivestage tanner scale  during thelarche the developing breasts sometimes are of unequal size and usually the left breast is slightly larger said condition of asymmetry is transitory and statistically normal to female physical and sexual development  moreover breast development sometimes is abnormal manifested either as overdevelopment eg virginal breast hypertrophy macromastia or as underdevelopment eg tuberous breast deformity micromastia in girls and women and manifested in boys and men as gynecomastia womans breasts the consequence of a biochemical imbalance between the normal levels of estrogen and testosterone in the male body  approximately two years after the onset of puberty a girls first menstrual cycle the hormone estrogen in conjunction with growth hormone stimulates the development and growth of the glandular fat and suspensory tissues that compose the breast this continues for approximately four years until establishing the final shape of the breast size volume density when she is a woman of approximately 21 years of age mammoplasia breast enlargement in girls begins at puberty unlike all other primates in which breasts enlarge only during lactation  the breasts are principally composed of adipose glandular and connective tissues  because these tissues have hormone receptors   their sizes and volumes fluctuate according to the hormonal changes particular to thelarche sprouting of breasts menstruation egg production pregnancy reproduction lactation feeding of offspring and menopause end of menstruation during the menstrual cycle the breasts are enlarged by premenstrual water retention and temporary growth  during pregnancy the breasts become enlarged and denser firmer because of the prolactincaused organ hypertrophy which begins the production of breast milk increases the size of the nipples and darkens the skin color of the nippleareola complex these changes continue during the lactation and the breastfeeding periods afterwards the breasts generally revert to their prepregnancy size shape and volume yet might show stretch marks  at menopause breast atrophy occurs  the breasts can decrease in size when the levels of circulating estrogen decline followed by the withering of the adipose tissue and the milk glands additional to such natural biochemical stimuli the breasts can become enlarged consequent to an adverse side effect of combined oral contraceptive pills and the size of the breasts can also increase and decrease in response to the body weight fluctuations of the woman moreover the physical changes occurred to the breasts often are recorded in the stretch marks of the skin envelope they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and the volume of a womans breasts throughout the course of her life  the primary function of the breasts as mammary glands is the feeding and the nourishing of an infant child with breast milk during the maternal lactation period the round shape of the breast helps to limit the loss of maternal body heat because milk production depends upon a highertemperature environment for the proper milkproduction function of the mammary gland tissues the lactiferous ducts regarding the shape of the breast the study the evolution of the human breast 2001 proposed that the rounded shape of a womans breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat that is because of the human infants small jaw which did not project from the face to reach the nipple he or she might block the nostrils against the mothers breast if it were of a flatter form cf chimpanzee theoretically as the human jaw receded into the face the womans body compensated with round breasts  in a woman the condition of lactation unrelated to pregnancy can occur as galactorrhea spontaneous milk flow and because of the adverse effects of drugs eg antipsychotic medications of extreme physical stress and of endocrine disorders in a newborn infant the capability of lactation is consequence of the mothers circulating hormones prolactin oxytocin etc in his or her blood stream which were introduced by the shared circulatory system of the placenta in men the mammary glands are also present in the body but normally remain undeveloped because of the hormone testosterone however when male lactation occurs it is considered a pathological symptom of a disorder of the pituitary gland breast ptosis or sagging of the breasts is a normal consequence of aging  where the breast tissue droops lower on the chest and the nipple points downward  researchers have found that ptosis is influenced by several key factors greater age higher body mass index larger bra cup size history of significant weight loss 50 lbs number of pregnancies and history of cigarette smoking    it is not caused as commonly believed by many women and medical practitioners by breastfeeding  plastic surgeons categorize ptosis by evaluating the position of the nipple relative to the inframammary crease where the underside of the breast meets the chest wall this is determined by measuring from the center of the nipple to the sternal notch at the top of the breast bone to gauge how far the nipple has fallen the standard anthropometric measurement for young women is 21 centimetres 83in this measurement is used to assess both breast ptosis and breast symmetry the surgeon will assess the breasts angle of projection the apex of the breast which includes the nipple can have a flat angle of projection 180 degrees or acute angle of projection greater than 180 degrees the apex rarely has an angle greater than 60 degrees the angle of the breast apex is partly determined by the tautness of the suspensory coopers ligaments for example when a woman lies on her back the angle of the breast apex becomes a flat obtuse angle less than 180 degrees while the basetolength ratio of the breast ranges from 05 to 10  the breast is susceptible to numerous benign and malignant conditions the most frequent benign conditions are puerperal mastitis fibrocystic breast changes and mastalgia breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in european prehistoric societies sculptures of female figures with pronounced or highly exaggerated breasts were common a typical example is the socalled venus of willendorf one of many paleolithic venus figurines with ample hips and bosom artifacts such as bowls rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15000bc up to late antiquity all across europe north africa and the middle east many female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk figures of the phoenician goddess astarte were represented as pillars studded with breasts isis an egyptian goddess who represented among many other things ideal motherhood was often portrayed as suckling pharaohs thereby confirming their divine status as rulers even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breastlike appendices such as the river god hapy who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the nile female breasts were also prominent in the minoan civilization in the form of the famous snake goddess statuettes in ancient greece there were several cults worshipping the kourotrophos the suckling mother represented by goddesses such as gaia hera and artemis the worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in greece became less common during the first millennium the popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the greek city states a legacy which was passed on to the later roman empire  during the middle of the first millennium bc greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down including female goddesses like athena the patron of athens who represented heroic endeavor there were exceptions aphrodite the goddess of love was more frequently portrayed fully nude though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty a portrayal that has been compared to modern pin ups by historian marilyn yalom  although nude men were depicted standing upright most depictions of female nudity in greek art occurred usually with drapery near at hand and with a forwardbending selfprotecting posture  a popular legend at the time was of the amazons a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow the legend was a popular motif in art during greek and roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale many women regard their breasts as important to their sexual attractiveness as a sign of femininity that is important to their sense of self due to this when a woman considers her breasts deficient in some respect she might choose to undergo a plastic surgery procedure to enhance them either to have them augmented or to have them reduced or to have them reconstructed if she suffered a deformative disease such as breast cancer  after mastectomy the reconstruction of the breast or breasts is done with breast implants or autologous tissue transfer using fat and tissues from the abdomen which is performed with a tram flap or with a back latissiumus muscle flap breast reduction surgery is a procedure that involves removing excess breast tissue fat and skin and the repositioning of the nippleareola complex cosmetic improvement procedures include breast lift mastopexy breast augmentation with implants and combination procedures the two types of available breast implants are models filled with silicone gel and models filled with saline solution these types of breast surgery can also repair inverted nipples by releasing milk duct tissues that have become tethered furthermore in the case of the obese woman a breast lift mastopexy procedure with or without a breast volume reduction can be part of an upperbody lift and contouring for the woman who has undergone massive body weight loss  surgery of the breast presents the health risk of interfering with the ability to breastfeed an infant child and might include consequences such as altered sensation in the nippleareola complex interference with mammography breast xrays images when there are breast implants present in the breasts regarding breastfeeding capability after breast reduction surgery studies reported that women who underwent breast reduction can retain the ability to nurse an infant child when compared to women in a control group who underwent breast surgery using a modern pedicle surgical technique        plastic surgery organizations generally discourage elective cosmetic breast augmentation surgery for teenaged girls because at that age the volume of the breast tissues milk glands and fat can continue to grow as the girl matures to womanhood breast reduction surgery for teenaged girls however is a matter handled according to the particulars of the case of hypoplasia see breast hypertrophy other means of breast enlargement also exist such as hormonal breast enhancement   because breasts are mostly fatty tissue their shape can within limits be molded by clothing such as foundation garments bras are commonly worn by about 90 of western women    and are often worn for support  the social norm in most western cultures is to cover breasts in public though the extent of coverage varies depending on the social context some religions ascribe a special status to the female breast either in formal teachings or through symbolism  islam forbids women from exposing their breasts in public many cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts as immodest or indecent in some cultures like the himba in northern namibia barebreasted women are normal while a thigh is highly sexualised and not exposed in public in a few western countries female toplessness at a beach is acceptable although it may not be acceptable in the town center in some areas exposing a womans breasts applies only to the exposure of nipples  in the united states women who breastfeed in public can receive negative attention there have been instances where women have been asked to leave public venues in new york the topfreedom equality movement helped to bring a case people v santorelli 1992 to the new york state court of appeals they ruled that new yorks indecent exposure laws did not apply to a barebreasted woman other gender equality efforts succeeded in most of canada in the 1990s barebreasted women are legal and culturally acceptable at public beaches in australia and much of europe  in some cultures breasts play a role in human sexual activity breasts and especially the nipples are among the various human erogenous zones they are sensitive to the touch as they have many nerve endings and it is common to press or massage them with hands or orally before or during sexual activity some women can achieve an orgasm from such activities research has suggested that the sensations are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation and may also be directly linked to the genital area of the brain   sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina clitoris and cervix nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain  in the ancient indian work the kama sutra light scratching of the breasts with nails and biting with teeth are considered erotic  during sexual arousal

aesthetically pleasing as well as erotic research conducted at the victoria university of wellington showed that breasts are often the first thing men look at and for a longer time than other body parts  the writers of the study had initially speculated that the reason for this is due to endocrinology with larger breasts indicating higher levels of estrogen and a sign of greater fertility   but the researchers said that men may be looking more often at the breasts because they are simply aesthetically pleasing regardless of the size  many people regard bare female breasts to be erotic and they can elicit heightened sexual desires in men in many cultures some people show a sexual interest in female breasts distinct from that of the person which may be regarded as a breast fetish  while us culture prefers breasts that are youthful and upright some cultures venerate women with drooping breasts indicating mothering and the wisdom of experience  there are many mountains named after the breast because they resemble it in appearance and so are objects of religious and ancestral veneration as a fertility symbol and of wellbeing in asia there was breast mountain which had a cave where
