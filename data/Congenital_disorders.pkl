V polydactyly or polydactylism from greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2 polys meaning many and \u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 daktylos meaning finger also known as hyperdactyly is a congenital physical anomaly in humans dogs and cats having supernumerary fingers or toes  polydactyly is the opposite of oligodactyly fewer fingers or toes in humansanimals this condition can present itself on one or both hands the extra digit is usually a small piece of soft tissue that can be removed occasionally it contains bone without joints rarely it may be a complete functioning digit the extra digit is most common on the ulnar little finger side of the hand less common on the radial thumb side and very rarely within the middle three digits these are respectively known as postaxial little finger preaxial thumb and central ring middle index fingers polydactyly the extra digit is most commonly an abnormal fork in an existing digit or it may rarely originate at the wrist as a normal digit does  the world record holder for highest number of digits is akshat saxena from uttar pradesh india he was born in 2010 with 7 digits on each hand and 10 digits on each foot for a total of 34 digits the incidence of congenital deformities in newborns is approximately 2 and 10 of these deformities involve the upper extremity   congenital anomalies of the limb can be classified in seven categories proposed by frantz and orahilly and modified by swanson based on the embryonic failure causing the clinical presentation these categories are failure of formation of parts failure of differentiation duplication overgrowth undergrowth congenital constriction band syndrome and generalized skeletal abnormalities   polydactyly belongs to the category of duplication  because there is an association between polydactyly and several syndromes children with a congenital upper extremity deformity should be examined by a geneticist for other congenital anomalies likewise if a syndrome is suspected or over two or three generations of the family are affected  research has shown that the majority of congenital anomalies occur during the 4week embryologic period of rapid limb development  polydactyly has been associated with 39 genetic mutations  more specific loci and genetic mechanisms responsible for disorders of duplications will be defined with time as molecular research continues  polydactyly can be divided into three major types which are discussed below this is the most common situation in which the extra digit is on the ulnar side of the hand thus the side of the little finger this can also be called postaxial polydactyly it can manifest itself very subtly for instance only as a nubbin on the ulnar side of the little finger or very distinctly as a fully developed finger most commonly the extra finger is rudimentary consisting of an end phalanx with a nail and connected to the hand with a small skin pedicle mostly one neurovascular bundle can be identified with no tendons present in the extra digit in case of a fully developed extra finger the duplication usually presents itself at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint a triplication of the little finger is very rare ulnar polydactyly occurs ten times more often in negroid ethnicities and is most common in african populations  the incidence in caucasians is reported as 1 in 1339 live births compared with 1 in 143 live births in africans and african americans ulnar polydactyly is also often part of a syndrome  in patients with african ancestry ulnar polydactyly mostly occurs isolated whereas the presentation in caucasians is often associated with a syndrome  in almost 14 of all patients this type of polydactyly is hereditary it usually passes on in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expression and incomplete penetrance it is genetically heterogenic meaning that mutations in different genes can be the cause when the extra digit is pedicled it can be very movable however injuries are rare and have never been reported so far  this is a less common situation which affects the side of the hand towards the thumb radial polydactyly refers to the presence of an extra digit or extra digits on the radial side of the hand it is most frequent in indian populations and it is the second most common congenital hand disorder the incidence of radial polydactyly is reported as 1 in every 3000 live births  the clinical features of radial polydactyly will depend upon the extent of duplication  radial polydactyly varies from a barely visible radial skin tag to complete duplication thumb polydactyly varies from barely visible broadening of the distal phalanx to full duplication of the thumb including the first metacarpal  radial polydactyly is frequently associated with several syndromes  this is a very rare situation in which the extra digit is on the ring middle or index finger of these fingers the index finger is most often affected whereas the ring finger is rarely affected  this type of polydactyly can be associated with syndactyly cleft hand and several syndromes   polysyndactyly presents various degrees of syndactyly affecting fingers three and four  polydactyly is associated with different mutations either mutations in a gene itself or in a cisregulatory element responsible for the expression of a specific gene mutations in hoxa or hoxd clusters are reported leading to polydactyly interactions of hoxd13 and gli3 induce synpolydactyly a combination of extra and consolidated digits other signal transduction pathways in this context are the wnt signaling pathway or notch  in the specific case of preaxial polydactyly hemingway mutant a cisacting mutation approximately 1mb upstream of shh gene has been implicated  normally shh is expressed in an organiser region called the zone of polarizing activity zpa on the posterior limb side from there it diffuses anteriorly laterally to the growth direction of the limb in the mutant smaller ectopic expression in a new organiser region is seen on the posterior side of the limb this ectopic expression causes cell proliferation delivering the raw material for one or more new digits    in addition to the study of genetic causes of polydactyly limb patterning models are used to simulate the congenital disorder at the limb being able to explain the development paths of polydactyly polydactyly can occur by itself or more commonly as one feature of a syndrome of congenital anomalies when it occurs by itself it is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in single genes ie it is not a multifactorial trait  but mutation in a variety of genes can give rise to polydactyly typically the mutated gene is involved in developmental patterning and a syndrome of congenital anomalies results of which polydactyly is one feature or two types include 97 genetic syndromes have been associated with different kinds of polydactyly  ulnar polydactyly is often bilateral and associated with syndactyly and polydactyly of the feet this can be a simple or complex polydactyly ulnar polydactyly occurs as an isolated congenital condition but can also be part of a syndrome the syndromes which occur with ulnar polydactyly are greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome meckel syndrome ellisvan creveld syndrome mckusickkaufman syndrome down syndrome bardetbiedl syndrome smithlemliopitz syndrome   type vii of radial polydactyly is associated with several syndromes holtoram syndrome fanconi anemia aplastic anemia by the age of 6 townesbrocks syndrome and greig cephalopolysyndactyly also known to occur with ulnar polydactyly  the syndromes associated with central polydactyly are bardetbiedl syndrome  meckel syndrome  pallisterhall syndrome  legius syndrome  holtoram syndrome  also central polydactyly can be associated with syndactyly and cleft hand   other syndromes including polydactyly include acrocallosal syndrome basal cell nevus syndrome biemond syndrome ectrodactylyectodermal dysplasiascleft lippalate syndrome mirror hand deformity mohr syndrome oralfacialdigital syndrome rubinsteintaybi syndrome short rib polydactyly and vater association  it can also occur with a triphalangeal thumb classification is performed by using xray imaging to see the bone structures  the classification of ulnar polydactyly exists of either two or three types the twostage classification according to temtamy and mckusick involves type a and b in type a there is an extra little finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint or more proximal including the carpometacarpal joint the little finger can be hypoplastic or fully developed type b varies from a nubbin to an extra nonfunctional little finger part on a pedicle according to the threetype classification type i includes nubbins or floating little fingers type ii includes duplications at the mcpj and type iii includes duplications of the entire ray  the wassel classification is the most widely used classification of radial polydactyly  based upon the most proximal level of skeletal duplication the most common type is wassel 4 about 50 of such duplications followed by wassel 2 20 and wassel 6 12  the classification of central polydactyly is based on the extent of duplication and involves the following three types type i is a central duplication not attached to the adjacent finger by osseous or ligamentous attachments it frequently does not include bones joints cartilage or tendons type iia is a nonsyndactylous duplication of a digit or part of a digit with normal components and articulates with a broad or bifid metacarpal or phalanx type iib is a syndactylous duplication of a digit or part of a digit with normal components and articulates with a broad or bifid metacarpal or phalanx type iii is a complete digital duplication which has a wellformed duplicated metacarpal   ulnar polydactyly usually does not interfere with hand function but for social reasons it can be treated operatively  the treatment of type a ulnar polydactyly is complex as its goal is to remove the accessory digit while maintaining a stable functional small finger when the duplicated proximal phalanx articulates with a common broad metacarpal head the ulnar collateral ligament must be considered in those cases with a common articulation or with a sixth metacarpal the muscle executing the abduction of the little finger abductor digiti minimi must be preserved  in patients with a common metacarpal articulation an elliptical incision at the base of the postaxial digit is made this incision may be extended proximally in order to adequately expose the abductor digiti minimi the ulnar collateral ligament and the insertions of the abductor digiti minimi are then elevated with a periosteal sleeve the duplicated extensor and flexor tendons to the ulnar digit are transected and after that the digit is amputated at its articulation with the metacarpal if the articular surface is wide the metacarpal may be shaved at last the collateral ligament and abductor digiti minimi are reinserted at the base of the preserved proximal phalanx and a wire is then placed across the reconstructed joint in patients with a duplicated metacarpal the accessory digit is amputated in a standard ray fashion with transfer of the abductor digiti minimi to the retained small finger  in this situation there is an absence of osseous and ligamentous structures the surgical technique is analogous to radial polydactyly in which the level of duplication and anatomical components should guide operative treatment  the pedicled ulnar extra digit can be removed by suture ligation to devise the skin bridge of the newborn child this might be easier than an excision of the extra digit when the child is 6 to 12 months old   ligation occludes the vascular supply to the duplicated digit resulting in dry gangrene and subsequent autoamputation  this must be done with consideration of the presence of a neurovascular bundle even in very small skin bridges when the ligation is done inappropriately it can give a residual nubbin also a neuroma can develop in the area of the scar an excision can prevent the development of a residual nubbin and the sensibility due to a neuroma  for infants with ulnar type b polydactyly the recommended treatment is ligation in the neonatal nursery studies have shown that excision of the extra digit in the neonatal nursery is a safe and simple procedure with a good clinical and cosmetic outcome  because neither of the two thumb components is normal a decision should be taken on combining which elements to create the best possible composite digit instead of amputating the most hypoplastic thumb preservation of skin nail collateral ligaments and tendons is needed to augment the residual thumb  surgery is recommended in the first year of life generally between 9 and 15 months of age  surgical options depend on type of polydactyly  this type of procedure is recommended for wassel types 1 and 2 in which both thumbs are severely hypoplastic by some congenital hand surgeons  the technique contains a composite wedge resection of the central bone and softtissue this will be achieved with approach of the lateral tissue of each thumb the goal is to achieve a normal thumb what concerns the size which is possible  if the width of the nail bed is greater than 70 of the contralateral thumb it may be split   then the nail bed will be repaired precisely this type of procedure is used for all wassel types of polydactyly and is the most commonly used technique it is recommended in all cases of thumb duplication with a hypoplastic lessfunctional thumb otherwise one could consider the bilhautcloquet the ulnar thumb is preferably preserved as it is the more developed one in most cases  by detaching the radial collateral ligament from distal to proximal a periosteal sleeve can be preserved  in this way the radial collateral band of the radial digit will function as the absent radial collateral ligament of the preserved ulnar thumb elevation of the apb and fpb is performed in wassel type 4 duplication this can be accomplished via the periosteum or separately as the tendons insert proximally the elevation is performed proximally too to potentially rebalance the ulnar thumb after the radial thumb is amputated the ulnar elements are centralized and fixed with a kirschner wire in most cases a longitudinal and sagittal osteotomy is needed to centralize the bony parts of the ulnar thumb while the softtissue of the radial thumb was preserved it is now attached to the radial side of the ulnar thumb together with the periosteal sleeve the apb and fpb of the ablated radial thumb are attached to the distal phalanx for more stability if necessary the extensor pollicis longus and the flexor pollicis longus are reattached to centralize their course  in wassel type 5 and 6 the opponens pollicis muscle must be transferred to the ulnar metacarpal soft tissue with collateral ligament reconstruction is used to avoid any angular deformity in the preserved thumb tendon centralization is also often used for correction still cases with osseous deformities may happen to provide alignment osteotomies are necessary to be done this operation may need bone grafting which is obtained from the amputated thumb  this type is indicated when one thumb is larger proximally and the other thumb has a larger distal component the procedure is initially described as a way to lengthen amputated digits the goal is to create a functional thumb by combining lesshypoplastic components on top plasty procedure is rarely employed in the treatment of congenital thumb duplication it is might be necessary for wassel types 4 5 6  at the level of the midproximal phalanx or midmetacarpal the distal component is transferred to the proximal component the tendons of the distal component are preserved as the rest of the distal component is amputated the neurovascular bundle which supplies the distal component is reserved and transferred proximally  early osteotomy and ligament reconstructions should be done to prevent deformities such as angular growth deformities  the surgical treatment of central polydactyly is highly variable after the surgery the hand must be functional and stable but also aesthetically pleasing this requires intraoperative creativity and flexibility the surgeon must also consider whether retention of a fully functional supranumerary digit is preferable to surgical intervention in contrast a functional fourfingered hand achieved via ray amputation may be preferable to a fivefingered hand with a deformed or stiff reconstructed finger  cases of polysyndactyly are approached through a standard opposing zigzag incision the incision is favored toward the accessory digit preserving extra skin for subsequent closure depending on the level and extent of duplication the flexor and extensor tendons may require centralization or rebalancing also the collateral ligaments must be preserved or reconstructed wide articular surfaces should be narrowed and phalangeal wedge osteotomies may be required to provide an axial alignment attention must also be given to reconstruct the intermetacarpal ligament furthermore one should take in mind the provision for adequate webspace soft tissue  there are no substantive outcome studies regarding the function of these hands following surgical intervention this is mainly caused by the fact that there is a generally normal function of these patients hands following ablation with collateral ligament reconstruction  in a study on 27 patients undergoing surgical excision for type a ulnar polydactyly only one complication was noted in the form of an infection  however no investigators have objectively reviewed functional range of motion or articular stability  in a study on 21 patients with type b ulnar polydactyly treated with suture ligation it was found that the duplicated digit was typically amputated at an average of 10 days and no complications of infection or bleeding were reported  in a large study on 105 patients treated with suture ligation an overall complication rate of 235 was reported citing a residual tender or unacceptable bump in 16 infection in 6 and bleeding in 1 of patients  in general suture ligation is safe and effective when applied to appropriate cases of type b polydactyly in which no substantial ligamentous or osseous structures are present within the pedicle parents should be educated as to the progression of necrosis and that revision of residual tissue or scar may be necessary when the child is 6 months of age or older  advantages by combining two hypoplastic thumbs a sufficient thumb size is acquired furthermore the ip and mcp joints are very stable as the collateral ligaments are not violated during reconstruction  disadvantages violation during reconstruction can lead to growth arrest or asymmetric growth nail deformity could also occur after reconstruction although the joint are stable restriction of flection may be possible  the average ip flexion in a reconstructed thumb is 55 degrees less than the contralateral thumb mcp flection averaged 55 degrees in reconstructed thumbs compared to 75 degrees in the contralateral thumb  advantages the reconstructed joints tend to remain flexible also it preserves the nail bed and physis this increases the prevention of nail deformities over time  disadvantages although surgeons try to obtain a stable thumb of appropriate size instability of the ip and mcp joint may occur as well as a size mismatch thumbs are defined as unacceptable if ip joint deviation exceeds 15 degrees mcp joint deviation exceeds 30 degrees and thumb size is inappropriate based on the examiners assessment also thumb size onethird greater or less than the contralateral thumb is defined as unacceptable  no surgical outcomes studies exist for evaluating the function of the thumbs after an ontop plasty reconstruction  few clinical outcome studies exist regarding the treatment of central polydactyly tada and colleagues note that satisfactory surgical correction of central polydactyly is difficult to achieve and that outcomes are generally poor in tadas study 12 patients were reviewed all patients required secondary surgical procedures to address flexion contractures and angular deviation at the ip joint level  however several primary factors contribute to the complexity of central polydactyly reconstruction hypoplastic joints and soft tissues that predispose the reconstructed finger to joint contracture and angular deformities as well as complex tendon anomalies are often difficult to address therefore treatment is wholly dependent on the anatomic components present the degree of syndactyly and the function of the duplicated finger  the condition has an incidence of 1 in every 500 live births  postaxial hand polydactyly is a common isolated disorder in african black children and autosomal dominant transmission is suspected postaxial polydactyly is more frequent in blacks than in whites and is more frequent in male children  in contrast postaxial polydactyly seen in white children is usually syndromic and associated with an autosomal recessive transmission one study by finley et al combined data from jefferson county alabama united states and uppsala county sweden this study showed incidence of all types of polydactyly to be 23 per 1000 in white males 06 per 1000 in white females 135 per 1000 in black males and 111 per 1000 in black females  cats normally have five digits on the front paws and four on the rear polydactyl cats have more and this is a moderately common condition especially in certain cat populations polydactyly is a common trait in several heritage chicken breeds including silkies a number of mutations of the lmbr1 gene in dogs humans and mice can cause polydactyly  a 2014 report indicated that mice could also exhibit polydactyly arising from mutation in the vps25 gene  dogs like other canids normally have four claws on their rear paws a fifth is often called a dewclaw and is especially found in certain dog breeds  including the norwegian lundehund and great pyrenees polydactyly was believed to be common in the earliest tetrapods the number of digits settling to the common five on each foot in amniotes and four to the hand and five to the foot in amphibians in the early carboniferous see polydactyly in early tetrapods

V disorders of sex development dsd sometimes referred to as disorders of sex differentiation or differences of sex development  are medical conditions involving the reproductive system more specifically these terms refer to congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal gonadal or anatomical sex is atypical  the term has been controversial the world health organization and many medical journals still reference dsds as intersex traits or conditions  the council of europe  and interamerican commission on human rights  have called for a review of medical classifications that unnecessarily medicalize intersex traits      dsds are medical conditions involving the way the reproductive system develops from infancy and before birth through young adulthood there are several types of dsds and their effect on the external and internal reproductive organs varies greatly a frequentlyused medical adjective for people with dsds is intersex intersex literally means that the body is between the two sexes male and female nevertheless most intersex people think of themselves as completely being either boysmen or girlswomen for this reason parents with dsd children and clinicians involved in dsd treatment usually try to make clear distinctions between biological sex social gender and sexual orientation this helps reduce confusion about the differences between being intersex being transgender and being gaylesbian the most common dsd is congenital adrenal hyperplasia cah which results in a person with female xx chromosomes having genitals that look somewhat masculine in mild cases cah results in a slightly enlarged clitoris while in more severe cases it can be difficult to decide just by looking whether a baby is male or female this is called having ambiguous genitals nevertheless if they are old enough to know the difference most children with cah think of themselves as girls cah is caused by a problem with the adrenal glands and is usually treated by taking a daily medication to replace or supplement the missing adrenal hormones when this adrenal problem occurs in people with male xy chromosomes the result is overmasculinization and premature puberty another common dsd is androgen insensitivity syndrome ais which means that a person with male xy chromosomes does not respond to testosterone in the usual way this results in a body that to some degree has a feminine appearance in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais the result is a totally feminine appearance including typical female breast development consequently most young women with cais are unaware of their condition until the early teen years when they fail to menstruate in the milder form called partial androgen insensitivity syndrome pais the genitals can vary from mostly female to almost completely male some people with pais think of themselves as girlswomen others regard themselves as boysmen and some consider themselves mixedgender some people with pais take hormones andor undergo surgery to give the genitals a more ordinary appearance in the past such surgeries were often performed in infancy but in recent years the tendency has been to postpone surgery until the child has expressed a clear gender preference and is old enough to participate actively in decisions about hisher medical treatment one of the more unusual dsds is 5alpha reductase deficiency 5ard popularly known as penis at 12 it is caused by a shortage early in life of an enzyme that activates testosterone in this condition a person with male xy chromosomes has a body that appears female before puberty after puberty begins other testosteroneactivating enzymes become available and the body soon takes on a masculine appearance with the scrotum and penis usually reaching typical or nearlytypical size if 5ard is diagnosed at a young age the child is generally raised as a boy since the majority of adults with this condition consider themselves men in addition to cah cais pais and 5ard there are several rarer types of dsds and in some cases it is not possible to make a clear diagnosis of the underlying condition the penis and clitoris are essentially the same organ differing only in size and generically called the phallus in typical males the urethra is located at the tip of the penis while in typical females the urethra is located below the base of the clitoris when the phallus is of intermediate size it is possible also to have a urethral opening located along the shaft this condition is known as hypospadia openminded parenting appropriate and conservative medical intervention and ageappropriate child involvement in the treatment plan contribute greatly to successful outcomes for the entire range of dsds  the term dsd and particularly its association with medical disorders has been controversial the argument over terminology reflects a deeper disagreement over the extent to which intersex conditions require medical intervention the appropriateness of certain interventions and whether physicians and parents should make irreversible treatment decisions on behalf of young children if the dsd is not lifethreatening morgan holmes argues that the replacement of the word intersex with disorders of sex development in clinical settings reinstitutionalises clinical power to delineate and silence those marked by the diagnosis and that this silencing is precisely the point of the new terminology  writing in advances in medical sociology georgiann davis described how in a series of articles on preimplantation genetic diagnosis in the american journal of bioethics in 2013 bioethicists and related authors reference intersex traits or intersex conditions professor jeff nisker describes how once a difference becomes a medical disorder to which the medical profession is dedicating time and resources to prevent procedures to this end become endowed with appropriateness  on 28 april 2014 the british medical journal published an article by associate professor rebecca jordanyoung emeritus professor peter sönksen and scholar katrina karkazis referencing women with intersex conditions  alternatives have been offered milton diamond has suggested the use of variation   or of difference  and elizabeth reis has suggested divergence  the latter two suggestions would retain the initial d in dsd in an october 2013 report of a parliamentary inquiry into the involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in australia the australian senates community affairs references committee recommended a review of clinical use of the term  a similar rejection of disorders of sex development was adopted elsewhere in australia in decisionmaking guidelines decisionmaking principles for the care of infants children and adolescents with intersex conditions published in february 2013 by the department of health of the state of victoria  australia has also enacted antidiscrimination legislation that includes the attribute intersex status   and published identity recognition guidelines available to intersex and other people  in may 2014 the world health organization issued a joint statement on eliminating forced coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization an interagency statement with the ohchr un women unaids undp unfpa and unicef the report references the involuntary surgical sexnormalising or other procedures on intersex persons the report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment including ensuring patient autonomy in decisionmaking ensuring nondiscrimination accountability and access to remedies  during 2015 the council of europe  and interamerican commission on human rights  have called for a review of medical classifications that unnecessarily medicalize intersex traits    an end to medical interventions without consent and improved disclosure the european union agency for fundamental rights  and un treaty bodies have called for consent by individuals subjected to medical treatment and improved disclosure

V marcus gunn phenomenon aka marcus gunn jawwinking   or trigeminooculomotor synkineses is an autosomaldominant condition with incomplete penetrance in which nursing infants will have rhythmic upward jerking of their upper eyelid this condition is characterized as a synkinesis when two or more muscles that are independently innervated have either simultaneous or coordinated movements common physiologic examples of synkineses occur during sucking chewing or conjugate eye movements there are also several abnormal cranial nerve synkineses both acquired and congenital marcus gunn jawwinking is an example of a pathologic congenital synkinesis first described by the ophthalmologist marcus gunn in 1883  this condition presents in approximately 5 of neonates with congenital ptosis this condition has been associated with amblyopia in 54 of cases anisometropia 26 and strabismus 56   it has been postulated that the synkinesis is due to damage to cranial nerve nuclei caused by peripheral nerve injury and the nuclear lesion releases evolutionarily older neural mechanisms with their tendency toward associated movements and so primitive reflexes are not inhibited marcus gunn jawwinking is an exaggeration of a very weak physiologic cocontraction that has been disinhibited secondary to a congenital brain stem lesion the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve by contraction of the pterygoid muscles of jaw results in the excitation of the branch of the oculomotor nerve that innervates the levator palpebrae superioris ipsilaterally on the same side of the face so the patient will have rhythmic upward jerking of their upper eyelid there are two major groups of trigeminooculomotor synkineses1 external pterygoidlevator synkinesis is when the eyelid raises upon 2 internal pterygoidlevator synkinesis is when the eyelid raises upon teeth clenching external pterygoidlevator synkinesis is the more common group treatment is usually unnecessary in severe cases surgery with a bilateral levator excision and frontalis brow suspension may be used  although treatment may be unnecessary there may be social implications especially in young children when venturing from a supportive home environment to a public environment eg starting school continued support including monitoring behavior and educating the child about his or her appearance as seen by others is encouraged gradual or sudden withdrawal from interaction with others is a sign that may or may not be related to such behavior studies are being conducted to elucidate these implications inverse marcus gunn phenomenon is a rare condition  that causes the eyelid to fall upon opening of the mouth in this case trigeminal innervation to the pterygoid muscles of the jaw is associated with an inhibition of the branch of the oculomotor nerve to the levator palpebrae superioris as opposed to stimulation in marcus gunn jawwinking

cocaine in smokable form as fetuses the concept of the crack baby emerged in the us during the 1980s and 1990s in the midst of a crack epidemic  early studies reported that people who had been exposed to crack in utero would be severely emotionally mentally and physically disabled this belief became common in the scientific and lay communities  fears were widespread that a generation of crack babies were going to put severe strain on society and social services as they grew up later studies failed to substantiate the findings of earlier ones that pce has severe disabling consequences these earlier studies had been methodologically flawed eg with small sample sizes and confounding factors scientists have come to understand that the findings of the early studies were vastly overstated and that most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero do not have disabilities  no specific disorders or conditions have been found to result for people whose mothers used cocaine while pregnant  studies focusing on children of six years and younger have not shown any direct longterm effects of pce on language growth or development as measured by test scores  pce also appears to have little effect on infant growth  however pce is associated with premature birth birth defects attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other conditions the effects of cocaine on a fetus are thought to be similar to those of tobacco and less severe than those of alcohol  no scientific evidence has shown a difference in harm to a fetus between crack and powder cocaine  studies have failed to clearly show that pce has negative cognitive effects partly because they may be due to concurrent factors  pce is very difficult to study because it very rarely occurs in isolation usually it coexists with a variety of other factors which may confound a studys results  for example pregnant mothers who use cocaine often use other drugs in addition or they may be malnourished and lacking in medical care children in households where cocaine is abused are at risk of violence and neglect and those in foster care may experience problems due to unstable family situations thus researchers have had difficulty in determining which effects result from pce and which result from other factors in the childrens histories   during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s in the us fear existed throughout the country that pce would create a generation of youth with severe behavioral and cognitive problems  early studies in the mid1980s reported that cocaine use in pregnancy caused children to have severe problems including cognitive developmental and emotional disruption  these early studies had methodological problems including small sample size confounding factors like poor nutrition and use of other drugs by the mothers  however the results of the studies sparked widespread media discussion in the context of the new war on drugs  for example a 1985 study that showed harmful effects of cocaine use during pregnancy created a huge media buzz   the term crack baby resulted from the publicity surrounding crack and pce  it was common in media reports of the phenomenon to emphasize that babies who had been exposed to crack in utero would never develop normally  the children were reported to be inevitably destined to be physically and mentally disabled for their whole lives  babies exposed to crack in utero were written off as doomed to be severely disabled and many were abandoned in hospitals  experts foresaw the development of a biological underclass of born criminals who would prey on the rest of the population   crime rates were predicted to rise when the generation of crackexposed infants grew up instead they dropped  it was predicted that the children would be difficult to console irritable and hyperactive putting a strain on the school system  charles krauthammer a columnist for the washington post wrote in 1989 theirs will be a life of certain suffering of probable deviance of permanent inferiority   the president of boston university at the time john silber said crack babies  wont ever achieve the intellectual development to have consciousness of god  these claims of soullessness biological inferiority and born criminals living in inner cities played easily into existing class and racial prejudice reporting was often sensational favoring the direst predictions and shutting out skeptics  at the time the proposed mechanism by which cocaine harmed fetuses was as a stimulantit was predicted that cocaine would disrupt normal development of parts of the brain that dealt with stimulation resulting in problems like bipolar disorder and attention deficit disorder  reports from the mid1980s to early 90s raised concerns about links between pce and slowed growth deformed limbs defects of the kidneys and genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts neurological damage small head size atrophy or cysts in the cerebral cortex bleeding into the brains ventricles obstruction of blood supply in the central nervous system  studies that find that exposure has significant effects may be more likely to be published than those that do not  a factor that may have biased reporting on the effects of pce toward indicating more severe outcomes as the crack epidemic emerged  between 1980 and 1989 57 of studies showing cocaine has effects on a fetus were accepted by the society for pediatric research compared with only 11 of studies showing no cocaine effects  after the early studies which reported that pce children would be severely disabled came studies that purported to show that cocaine exposure in utero has no important effects  almost every prenatal complication originally thought to be due directly to pce was found to result from confounding factors such as poor maternal nutrition use of other drugs depression and lack of prenatal care  more recently the scientific community has begun to reach an understanding that pce does have some important effects but that they are not severe as was predicted in the early studies  most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero are normal  the effects of pce are subtle but they exist    cocaine a small molecule is able to cross the placenta into the bloodstream of the fetus  in fact it may be present in a higher concentration in the amniotic fluid than it is in the mothers bloodstream  the skin of the fetus is able to absorb the chemical directly from the amniotic fluid until the 24th week of pregnancy  cocaine can also show up in breast milk and affect the nursing baby   cocaine prevents the reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine  thus they stay in the synapse longer causing excitement of the sympathetic nervous system and evoking a stress response  the euphoria experienced by cocaine users is thought to be largely due to the way it prevents the neurotransmitter serotonin from being reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron which released it  use of cocaine during pregnancy can negatively affect both the mother and the fetus  the ways in which it affects the fetus are poorly understood  there are multiple mechanisms by which cocaine exposure harms a fetus in addition to altering brain chemistry it may alter expression of certain genes and it causes vasoconstriction narrowing of blood vessels  constricting blood vessels causes tissues to receive insufficient blood flow killing cells but this effect is less pronounced with cocaine than with nicotine  the neurotransmitters affected by cocaine are involved in the development of the fetuss brain  so the drug may affect fetal development directly by altering the development of the brains monoaminergic system  in studies with rats cocaine has been shown to cause apoptosis programmed cell death in fetuses this could be a mechanism for some of the abnormalities of the heart associated with pce  another possible mechanism by which cocaine harms the fetus may be in part by interfering with blood supply to the uterus   the reduction in blood flow to the uterus limits the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus  the reduced blood flow to the uterus may also play a role in congenital malformations and slowed fetal growth  for example it may be this reduction in blood flow that leads to gut damage in the infant  cocaine causes changes in the mothers blood pressure that are thought to be the cause of strokes in the fetus one study found that 6 of cocaineexposed infants had had one or more strokes  such prenatal strokes may be the cause of neurological problems found in some cocaineexposed infants after birth  blood vessel contraction can also cause premature labor and birth  cocaine has also been found to enhance the contractility of the tissue in the uterus another factor that has been suggested as a possible mechanism for its contribution to increased prematurity rates  increased contractility of the uterus may also be behind the increased likelihood of placental abruption the placenta tearing away from the uterine wall which some findings have linked with pce  cocaine use during pregnancy can be discovered by asking the mother but sometimes women will not admit to having used drugs this maternal interview method has been found to be less reliable for discovering cocaine use than for other drugs such as cannabis  mothers may lie for fear of having their children taken away but even when they are willing to tell the truth their memories may not be very accurate  more reliable methods for detecting cocaine exposure involve testing the newborns hair or meconium the infants earliest stool  hair analysis however can give false positives for cocaine exposure  and a newborn may not have enough hair to test  the mothers urine can also be tested for drugs but it cannot detect drugs used too far in the past or determine how much or how often the drugs were used  drug use in the first trimester is the most harmful to the fetus in terms of neurological and developmental outcome  the effects of pce later in a childs life are poorly understood there is little information about the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on children over age five  some studies have found pcerelated differences in height and weight while others have not these differences are generally gone or small by the time children are schoolage  much is still not known about what factors may exist to aid children who were exposed to cocaine in utero  it is unknown if the effects of pce are increased once children reach adolescence or whether the neural rewiring that occurs during this developmental period attenuates the effects  a review of 27 studies performed between 2006 and 2012 found that cognitive development was mildly to moderately affected in pce adolescents but it was not clear how important these effects were in practical terms  unlike fetal alcohol syndrome no set of characteristics has been discovered that results uniquely from cocaine exposure in utero  cocaine exposure in utero may affect the structure and function of the brain predisposing children to developmental problems later or these effects may be explained by children of crackusing mothers being at higher risk for domestic violence deadbeat parenting and maternal depression  systematic reviews have found that after controlling for other factors that could be misleading there is no evidence that fetal crack exposure causes problems different from those caused by other risk factors to which those fetuses are exposed  when researchers are able to identify effects that result from pce these effects are typically small  some effects of pce have been demonstrated with high exposures to cocaine but not with low ones  as many as 1727 of cocaineusing pregnant women deliver prematurely  in association with prematurity growth in the womb is reduced and low birth weight is connected to pce  there are also data showing that spontaneous abortion is associated with cocaine use  the increased risk of placental abruption with cocaine use has been well documented  using cocaine while pregnant also heightens the chances of maternal and fetal vitamin deficiencies respiratory distress syndrome for the baby and infarction of the bowels  early reports found that cocaineexposed babies were at high risk for sudden infant death syndrome  however by itself cocaine exposure during fetal development has not subsequently been identified as a risk factor for the syndrome  some but not all pce children experience hypertonia excessive muscle tone  and reduced reflexes and motor function have been found in babies four to six weeks old  pce may have an effect on the neuroendocrine system but more study is needed to determine whether it does and what the effects are  while newborns who were exposed prenatally to drugs such as barbiturates or heroin frequently have symptoms of drug withdrawal neonatal abstinence syndrome this does not happen with babies exposed to crack in utero at least such symptoms are difficult to separate in the context of other factors such as prematurity or prenatal exposure to other drugs  studies have shown small deficits in behavioral cognitive attention emotional and language function in pce infants children and adolescents  however other studies attribute findings of negative effects on cognitive development to confounding factors  in iq studies cocaineexposed children score no lower than others and children exposed to marijuana and alcohol in utero were at the same level as those who were exposed to those drugs in addition to cocaine  in schoolage and younger children pce does not appear in studies to predispose children to poorer intellectual performance  however results of studies aiming to measure mental performance have been mixed with some reporting measurable deficits in cocaineexposed babies and others showing no differences between cocaineexposed and control groups  poor performance on iq tests could actually be due to trouble with sustaining attention if the tests fail to account for this factor separately  studies of developmental delays have also been mixed  cocaine causes impaired growth of the fetuss brain an effect that is most pronounced with high levels of cocaine and prolonged duration of exposure throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy  those pce children who had slowed brain growth as fetuses are at higher risk for impaired brain growth and motor language and attention problems after they are born  studies have found that children exposed to cocaine during fetal development experience problems with language behavior development and attention   however these effects are small especially when studies control for other factors like exposure to other drugs  cognitive and attention skills can be impacted by pce possibly due to effects on brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex  children whose mothers used cocaine during pregnancy may develop symptoms akin to those of attention deficit disorder  language development has also been found in some studies to be impacted by pce  but language studies have failed to reliably show a detriment caused by in utero cocaine exposure  evidence suggests that in utero cocaine exposure leads to problems with behavior and sustained attention possibly by affecting parts of the brain that are vulnerable to toxins during fetal development  schoolage pce children have been found to have trouble regulating their behavior and sustaining their attention  the changes in behavior and attention caused by pce are measurable by standardized scales  however these behavioral effects seem to be mild  studies from the 2000s and 2010s are conflicted on whether pce adolescents are at greater risk for use of drugs such as cocaine alcohol and marijuana  a 2010 study found that pce adolescent girls were more likely to suffer anxiety than their nonexposed peers  pce may interfere with the way the motor system matures  reports on whether pce affects motor functioning are mixed some report measurable deficits and others do not  some but not all studies have found impairments in development of motor skills in cocaineexposed babies younger than seven months but not older however this finding could be attributed to a failure to control for in utero tobacco exposure  a review of the literature reported that cocaine use causes congenital defects between 15 and 20 of the time however another largescale study found no difference in rates of birth anomalies in pce and nonpce infants  it is not well understood why cocaine exposure is associated with congenital malformations  it has been suggested that some of these birth defects could be due to cocaines disruption of blood vessel growth  most pcerelated congenital defects are found in the brain heart genitourinary tract arms and legs  cocaine use by pregnant mothers may directly or indirectly contribute to defects in the formation of the circulatory system and is associated with abnormalities in development of the aorta  abnormalities in the development of the heart both before and after birth have been linked to pce the mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood  heart malformations can include a missing ventricle and defects with the septum of the heart and can result in potentially deadly congestive heart failure  genital malformations occur at a higherthannormal rate with pce  the liver and lungs are also at higher risk for abnormalities  cloverleaf skull a congenital malformation in which the skull has three lobes the brain is deformed and hydrocephalus occurs is also associated with pce  an estimated 06 to 3 of pregnant women worldwide use cocaine  a 1995 survey in the us found that between 30000 and 160000 cases of prenatal exposure to cocaine occur each year  by one estimate in the us 100000 babies are born each year after having been exposed to crack cocaine in utero  pregnant women in urban parts of the us and who are of a low socioeconomic status use cocaine more often  however the real prevalence of cocaine use by pregnant women is unknown  the harm to a child from pce has implications for public policy and law some us states have pressed charges against pregnant women who use drugs including child abuse homicide and distribution of drugs to a minor however these approaches have generally been rejected in the courts on the basis that a fetus is not legally a child  between 1985 and 2001 more than 200 women in over 30 us states faced prosecution for drug use during pregnancy  in south carolina a woman who used crack in her third trimester of pregnancy was sentenced to prison for eight years when her child was born with cocaine metabolites in its system  the supreme court of south carolina upheld this conviction  from 1989 to 1994 in the midst of public outcry about cocaine babies the medical university of south carolina tested pregnant women for cocaine reporting those who tested positive to the police  the us supreme court found the policy to be unacceptable on constitutional grounds in 2001  some advocates argue that punishment for crackusing pregnant women as a means to treat their addiction is a violation of their right to privacy  according to studies fear of prosecution and having children taken away is associated with a refusal to seek prenatal care or medical treatment  some nonprofit organizations aim to prevent pce with birth control one such initiative project prevention offers crackaddicted women money as an incentive to undergo longterm birth control or frequently sterilizationan approach which has led to public outcry from those who consider this practice to be eugenics  children who were exposed to crack prenatally face social stigma as babies and schoolaged children some experts say that the crack baby stigma is more harmful than the pce  teachers who know that a child had been exposed to crack in utero may expect these children to be disruptive and developmentally delayed  children who were exposed to cocaine may be teased by others who know of the exposure and problems these children have may be misdiagnosed by doctors or others as resulting from pce when they may really be due to factors like illness or abuse  the social stigma of the drug also complicates studies of pce researchers labor under the awareness that their findings will have political implications  in addition the perceived hopelessness of crack babies may cause researchers to ignore possibilities for early intervention that could help them  the social stigma may turn out to be a selffulfilling prophecy  a number of the effects that had been thought after early studies to be attributable to prenatal exposure to cocaine are actually due partially or wholly to other factors such as exposure to other substances including tobacco alcohol or marijuana or to the environment in which the child is raised   some effects such as head circumference body weight and height that appear in studies to result from prenatal cocaine exposure disappear when studies control for prenatal exposure to other drugs  pce is very difficult to study because of a variety of factors that may confound the results pre and postnatal care may be poor the pregnant mother and child may be malnourished the amount of cocaine a mother takes can vary she may take a variety of drugs during pregnancy in addition to cocaine measurements for detecting deficits may not be sensitive enough and results that are found may only last a short time  studies differ in how they define heavy or light cocaine use during pregnancy and the time period of exposure during pregnancy on which they focus eg first second or third trimester  pce is clustered with other risk factors to the child such as maltreatment domestic violence and prenatal exposure to other substances  such environmental factors are known to adversely affect children in the same areas being studied with respect to pce  most women who use cocaine while pregnant use other drugs too one study found that 93 of those who use cocaine or opiates also use tobacco marijuana or alcohol  when researchers control for use of other drugs many of the seeming effects of cocaine on head size birth weight apgar scores and prematurity disappear  addiction to any substance including crack may be a risk factor for child abuse or neglect  crack addiction like other addictions distracts parents from the child and leads to inattentive parenting  conversely lowstress environments and responsive caregiving may provide a protective effect on the childs brain potentially compensating for negative effects of pce  many drug users do not get prenatal care for a variety of reasons including that they may not know they are pregnant  many crack addicts get no medical care at all and have extremely poor diets and children who live around crack smoking are at risk of inhaling secondary smoke  cocaine using mothers also have a higher rate of sexually transmitted infections such as hiv and hepatitis  drug use by mothers puts children at high risk for environmental problems and pce does not present much risk beyond these risk factors  in some cases it is not clear whether direct results of pce lead to behavioral problems or whether environmental factors are at fault  for example children who have caregiver instability may have more behavioral problems as a result or it may be that behavioral problems manifested by pce children lead to greater turnover in caregivers  other factors that make studying pce difficult include high rates of attrition loss of participants from studies unwillingness of mothers to tell the truth about drug history and uncertainty of dosages of street drugs  the difficulties in isolating crack exposure and other difficulties with studies mean that although many effects previously thought to have been attributable to crack exposure in utero have not been found undiscovered effects may emerge as pressures on children grow as they reach school age and puberty  in research studies on pregnant rats injected cocaine did less damage to cells than injected nicotine and more recovery occurred between doses

V abdominal wall defects are a type of congenital defect that allows the stomach the intestines or other organs to protrude through an unusual opening that forms on the abdomen  during the development of the fetus many unexpected changes occur inside the womb specifically the stomach intestines or other organs begin to develop outside the fetus abdomen through the abnormal hole in the abdomen and as development progresses the abdominal wall eventually encloses these organs in some cases of defect either the umbilical opening is too oversized or has developed improperly which allows the organs to remain outside or to squeeze through the abdominal wall  there are two main types of abdominal wall defects that result due to the changes during development they are omphalocele and gastroschisis gastroschisis develops when the abdominal wall does not completely close and the organs are present outside of the infants body omphalocele occurs when some of the organs protrude through the muscles of the abdomen in the area surrounding the umbilical cord omphalocele can be either minor with only some of the organs exposed or severe with most if not all of the abdominal organs being exposed    out of all of the causes of birth defects information about a great number is still unknown as of 2004 the reason that abdominal wall defects occur has yet to be determined or understood the symptoms that the mother may present that would indicate the development of the defect and unnoticeable   most cases of abdominal wall defects have been found to be sporadic and have no relationship with the history of the disorder within the family  the epa is aware that a common herbicide called atrazine causes abdominal wall defects as well as other birth defects and cancer atrazine has been banned in the eu since 2004 yet is still commonly used in the us despite the evidence of harm atrazine affects the drinking water supply most predominantly in the midwest the center for disease control and prevention did a study on the relationship between atrazine and abdominal wall defects gastroschisis and omphalocele are congenital abdominal wall defects awd atrazine and nitrates are common agricultural fertilizers and concluded indiana has significantly higher rates of awd abdominal wall defects compared with national rates increased atrazine levels correlate with increased incidence of awd before birth openings in the abdomen can usually be detected be a detailed ultrasound or afp screening in addition to the ultrasound or afp scanning it is also necessary for children with this defect to be checked for other birth defects because genetic disorders are usually associated with some of the abdominal wall defects in looking for other genetic disorders that may be associated genetic counseling and further genetic testing such as amniocentesis are offered  concerns that arise due to abdominal wall defects can be threatening and require immediate and intensive medical care some infections may persist for long periods of time and lead to serious complications such as feeding problems which can cause the infant to require several surgeries since these complications can be severe it is recommended that parents work closely with a team of physicians throughout the duration of the treatment after the treatment is completed children with abdominal wall defects may need additional help additional services are usually necessary for with omphalocele and the associated chromosomal abnormalities and birth defects that also arise treatments in these cases are longterm and focus on the physical and developmental difficulties that the children will endure the parents may find this process difficult and need assistance in dealing with the process by a service that is provided by the healthcare team  abdominal wall defects specifically the main two types gastroschisis and omphalocele are rare in occurrence  there occurrence is only in approximately one case out of every 5000 births  with rates in the united states only occurring in about one case out of 2000 births these numbers mean that there are only about 2360 cases of this disease diagnosed in the united states per year in looking at the specifics of the individuals who develop this disorder there is no difference in the number of cases found in boys verses girls mothers who are below the age of twenty are almost four times as likely to have an offspring that has developed an abdominal wall defect as a mother who is in her late twenties and older   abdominal wall defects can be treated surgically if there is no accompanying anomalies the surgical procedure also called omphalocele repairclosure or gastroschisis repairclosure is not overcomplicated the organs are normal but are misplaced however if the abdominal cavity is too small or when the organs are too large or swollen to close the skin it may be difficult to fit all the viscera into the small abdominal cavity in such cases the surgeon will place a covering pouch generally made of silastic commonly called a silo because its shaped like an agricultural silo over the abdominal organs on the outside of the infant  the silo serves to conserve heat and prevent infection  the silo is springloaded so that the device can be attached to the inside of the abdominal wall without sutures the top of the silo is secured in a way that causes it to stand upright so that the bowels are gradually coaxed into the abdominal cavity by gravity this process can take up to a week and final closure may be performed a few weeks later more surgery may be required to repair the abdominal muscles at a later time if there are no other defects the prognosis after surgical repair of this condition is relatively good however 10 of those with more severe or additional abnormalities die from it the organs themselves are fully functional the difficulty lies in fitting them inside the abdomen the condition is in fact a hernia requiring only replacement and strengthening of the passageway through which it occurred after surgery increased pressure in the stretched abdomen can compromise the function of the organs inside

V a meckels diverticulum a true congenital diverticulum is a slight bulge in the small intestine present at birth and a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct also called the vitelline duct or yolk stalk it is the most common malformation of the gastrointestinal tract and is present in approximately 2 of the population  with males more frequently experiencing symptoms meckels diverticulum was first explained by fabricius hildanus in the sixteenth century and later named after johann friedrich meckel who described the embryological origin of this type of diverticulum in 1809     meckels diverticulum is located in the distal ileum usually within 60100cm 2feet of the ileocecal valve this blind segment or small pouch is about 36cm long and may have a greater lumen diameter than that of the ileum  it runs antimesenterically and has its own blood supply it is a remnant of the connection from the yolk sac to the small intestine present during embryonic development it is a true diverticulum consisting of all 3 layers of the bowel wall which are mucosa submucosa and muscularis propria  as the vitelline duct is made up of pluripotent cell lining meckels diverticulum may harbor abnormal tissues containing embryonic remnants of other tissue types jejunal duodenal mucosa or brunners tissue were each found in 2 of ectopic cases heterotopic rests of gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue are seen in 60 and 6 of cases respectively heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location  inflammation of this meckels diverticulum may mimic appendicitis therefore during appendectomy ileum should be checked for the presence of meckels diverticulum if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix a memory aid is the rule of 2s  however the exact values for the above criteria range from 025 for example prevalence is probably 024  it can also be present as an indirect hernia typically on the right side where it is known as a hernia of littré a case report of strangulated umbilical hernia with meckels diverticulum has also been published in the literature  furthermore it can be attached to the umbilical region by the vitelline ligament with the possibility of vitelline cysts or even a patent vitelline canal forming a vitelline fistula when the umbilical cord is cut torsions of intestine around the intestinal stalk may also occur leading to obstruction ischemia and necrosis the majority of people with a meckels diverticulum are asymptomatic an asymptomatic meckels diverticulum is called a silent meckels diverticulum  if symptoms do occur they typically appear before the age of two years the most common presenting symptom is painless rectal bleeding such as melaenalike black offensive stools followed by intestinal obstruction volvulus and intussusception occasionally meckels diverticulitis may present with all the features of acute appendicitis also severe pain in the epigastric region is experienced by the patient along with bloating in the epigastric and umbilical regions at times the symptoms are so painful that they may cause sleepless nights with acute pain felt in the foregut region specifically in the epigastric and umbilical regions in most cases bleeding occurs without warning and stops spontaneously the symptoms can be extremely painful often mistaken as just stomach pain resulting from not eating or constipation a technetium99m 99mtc pertechnetate scan also called meckel scan is the investigation of choice to diagnose meckels diverticula in children this scan detects gastric mucosa since approximately 50 of symptomatic meckels diverticula have ectopic gastric or pancreatic cells contained within them  this is displayed as a spot on the scan distant from the stomach itself in children this scan is highly accurate and noninvasive with 95 specificity and 85 sensitivity  however in adults the test is only 9 specific and 62 sensitive  patients with these misplaced gastric cells may experience peptic ulcers as a consequence therefore other tests such as colonoscopy and screenings for bleeding disorders should be performed and angiography can assist in determining the location and severity of bleeding colonoscopy might be helpful to rule out other sources of bleeding but it is not used as an identification tool angiography might identify brisk bleeding in patients with meckels diverticulum  ultrasonography could demonstrate omphaloenteric duct remnants or cysts  computed tomography ct scan might be a useful tool to demonstrate a blind ended and inflamed structure in the midabdominal cavity which is not an appendix  in asymptomatic patients meckels diverticulum is often diagnosed as an incidental finding during laparoscopy or laparotomy treatment is surgical potentially with a laparoscopic resection  in patients with bleeding strangulation of bowel bowel perforation or bowel obstruction treatment involves surgical resection of both the meckels diverticulum itself along with the adjacent bowel segment and this procedure is called a small bowel resection  in patients without any of the aforementioned complications treatment involves surgical resection of the meckels diverticulum only and this procedure is called a simple diverticulectomy  with regards to asymptomatic meckels diverticulum some recommend that a search for meckels diverticulum should be conducted in every case of appendectomylaparotomy done for acute abdomen and if found meckels diverticulectomy or resection should be performed to avoid secondary complications arising from it  meckels diverticulum occurs in about 2 of the population  prevalence in males is 35 times higher than in females  only 2 of cases are symptomatic which usually presents among children at the age of 2  most cases of meckels diverticulum are diagnosed when complications manifest or incidentally in unrelated conditions such as laparotomy laparoscopy or contrast study of the small intestine classic presentation in adults includes intestinal obstruction and inflammation of the diverticulum diverticulitis painless rectal bleeding most commonly occurs in toddler inflammation in the ileal diverticulum has symptoms that mimic appendicitis therefore its diagnosis is of clinical importance detailed knowledge of the pathophysiological properties is essential in dealing with the lifethreatening complications of meckels diverticulum  the omphalomesenteric duct omphaloenteric duct vitelline duct or yolk stalk normally connects the embryonic midgut to the yolk sac ventrally providing nutrients to the midgut during embryonic development the vitelline duct narrows progressively and disappears between the 5th and 8th weeks gestation in meckels diverticulum the proximal part of vitelline duct fails to regress and involute which remains as a remnant of variable length and location  the solitary diverticulum lies on the antimesenteric border of the ileum opposite to the mesenteric attachment and extends into the umbilical cord of the embryo  the left and right vitelline arteries originate from the primitive dorsal aorta and travel with the omphaloenteric duct the right becomes the superior mesenteric artery that supplies a terminal branch to the diverticulum while the left involutes  having its own blood supply meckels diverticulum is susceptible to obstruction or infection the lifetime risk for a person with meckels diverticulum to develop certain complications is about 46 gastrointestinal bleeding peritonitis or intestinal obstruction may occur in 1530 of symptomatic patients table 1 only 64 of all complications requires surgical treatment and untreated meckels diverticulum has a mortality rate of 2515  table 1  complications of meckels diverticulum  bleeding of the diverticulum is most common in young children especially in males who are less than 2 years of age  symptoms may include bright red blood in stools hematochezia weakness abdominal tenderness or pain and even anaemia in some cases  hemorrhage may be caused by the appearance of stools may indicate the nature of the haemorrhage inflammation of the diverticulum can mimic symptoms of appendicitis ie periumbilical tenderness and intermittent crampy abdominal pain perforation of the inflamed diverticulum can result in peritonitis diverticulitis can also cause adhesions leading to intestinal obstruction  diverticulitis may result from symptoms vomiting abdominal pain and severe or complete constipation  anomalies between the diverticulum and umbilicus may include the presence of fibrous cord cyst fistula or sinus leading to  tumors in meckels diverticulum may cause bleeding acute abdominal pain gastrointestinal obstruction perforation or intussusception

V factor i deficiency also known as fibrinogen deficiency is a rare inherited bleeding disorder related to fibrinogen function in the blood coagulation cascade it is typically subclassified into three distinct disorders afibrinogenemia hypofibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia  afibrinogenemia is defined as a lack of fibrinogen in the blood clinically 20mgdeciliter of plasma the frequency of this disorder is estimated at between 05 and 2 per million  hypofibrinogenemia is defined as a partial deficiency of fibrinogen clinically 2080mgdeciliter of plasma estimated frequency varies from 05 to 3 per million   dysfibrinogenemia is defined as malfunctioning or nonfunctioning fibrinogen in the blood albeit at normal concentrations 200400mgdeciliter of plasma hypodysfibrinogenemia is a partial deficiency of fibrinogen that is also malfunctioning estimated frequency varies from 1 to 3 per million   within the united states afibrinogenemia accounts for 24 of all inherited abnormalities of fibrinogen while hypofibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia account for 38 each    the disorders associated with factor i deficiency are generally inherited   although certain liver diseases can also affect fibrinogen levels and function eg cirrhosis  afibrinogenemia is a recessive inherited disorder where both parents must be carriers  hypofibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia can be dominant ie only one parent needs to be a carrier or recessive  the origin of the disorders is traced back to three possible genes fga fgb or fgg because all three are involved in forming the hexameric glycoprotein fibrinogen mutations in any one of the three genes can cause the deficiency   afibrinogenemia is typically the most severe of the three disorders common symptoms include bleeding of the umbilical cord at birth traumatic and surgical bleeding gi tract oral and mucosal bleeding spontaneous splenal rupture and rarely intracranial hemorrhage and articular bleeding   symptoms of hypofibrinogenemia varies from mild to severe but can include bleeding of the gi tract oral and mucosal bleeding and very rarely intracranial bleeding more commonly it presents during traumatic bleeding or surgical procedures   most cases 60 of dyfibrinogenemia are asymptomatic but 28 exhibit hemorrhaging similar to that described above while 20 exhibit thrombosis ie excessive clotting  the most common type of treatment is cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate drip to increase fibrinogen levels to normal during surgical procedures or after trauma    riastap a factor i concentrate was approved by the us fda in 2009 for use in cases where the fibrinogen level was below 50mgdeciliter of plasma  recently antifibrinolytics have also been used to inhibit fibrinolysis breaking down of the fibrin clot   in the case of dysfibrinogenemia that manifests by thrombosis anticoagulants can be used  due to the inhibited clotting ability associated with a and hypofibrinogenemia physicians advise against the use of aspirin as it is known to inhibit platelet function

V macrostomia from the greek prefix makro meaning large and from greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 mouth  refers to a mouth that is unusually wide  macrostomia is characterized as a physical abnormality that causes clefts to form on the face of affected individuals these clefts can form on either or both sides of the face but they are most commonly seen on the right cheek and have a higher rate of occurrence in males  macrostomia is very irregular and on average occurs only once in every 150000 to 300000 live births  its unusual for macrostomia to occur on its own and it is included as a symptom for many diseases including craniofacial microsomia  the clefts result from improper development and fusion of the mandibular and maxillary processes  the clefts cause problems with facial muscle development  the origin of macrostomia is not yet fully understood it could potentially have multiple causes    there are four distinct variations of macrostomia  classifications are a complete lateral facial cleft simple macrostomia macrostomia with diastasis of the facial musculature and isolated facial musculature diastasis  each has a different physical appearance with varying levels of severity  the cleft associated with macrostomia is associated with improper or failed fusion of the mandibular and maxillary processes during embryonic development  this can lead to a variety of abnormalities involving skin subcutaneous tissue facial muscles and the mucous membrane  the severity of each abnormality can vary from minor to severe environmental contaminants may play a role in causing macrostomia many affected individuals were found in lagos an industrial area of nigeria where water supplies are known to be contaminated by improper disposal of industrial and domestic waste  the facial cleft runs from the corner of the mouth towards the bottom of the ear the outside of the ear on the affected side of the face appears as normal and a region of soft tissue connects the cleft to the right lateral posterior hard palate internally there is no soft palate  this version of macrostomia is less severe because it does not affect the facial muscles and is not associated with any soft tissue or bone deformities a small clefts extends from the mouth and can be repaired surgically  clefts in this variant are slightly more severe than the ones seen in simple macrostomia it also does not have bone deformities but it does include minor soft tissue deformities the defining feature is muscle diastasis which is separation of the masseter this phenotype can also be partially corrected with surgery  the facial cleft in this case results in a more severe muscle separation even though there is not a true open cleft bones in the region remain unaffected and the phenotype appears as an indentation of the cheek rather than an open cleft the external ear in this phenotype can also be deformed  likely due to the complexity of macrostomia many theories have been provided over time in an attempt to define its origin there is no definitive mechanism to explain its development but it is likely that there are interactions between genes and the environment resulting in improper development of the first and sometimes second brachial arch  macrostomia can be partially classified as a heritable autosomal dominant disease  the responsible mutation is found on the short arm of chromosome one in locations 3234 1p321p34  the mutation is heterozygous meaning that it only occurs in one allele a single base substitution in the 11th coding region of the gene ptch2 changes an adenine to guanine  this results in a valine being incorporated instead of an isoleucine at the 147th position during translation of the resulting transmembrane protein val147ile  the transmembrane protein encoded by ptch2 is 1204 amino acids long and is involved with inhibiting the sonic hedgehog signalling pathway that is involved with development  ptch2 inhibits the smooth frizzled class receptor smo which when active is responsible for increasing transcription rates of many genes involved with development and differentiation   ptch2 val147ile is a loss of function mutation which results in a lack of control of cell growth during development and links it to macrostomia

V diastematomyelia occasionally diastomyelia is a congenital disorder in which a part of the spinal cord is split usually at the level of the upper lumbar vertebra diastematomyelia is a rare congenital anomaly that results in the splitting of the spinal cord in a longitudinal sagittal direction females are affected much more commonly than males this condition occurs in the presence of an osseous bone cartilaginous or fibrous septum in the central portion of the spinal canal which then produces a complete or incomplete sagittal division of the spinal cord into two hemicords when the split does not reunite distally to the spur the condition is referred to as a diplomyelia or true duplication of the spinal cord   diastematomyelia is a dysraphic state of unknown embryonic origin but is probably initiated by an accessory neurenteric canal an additional embryonic spinal canal this condition may be an isolated phenomenon or may be associated with other segmental anomalies of the vertebral bodies such as spina bifida kyphoscoliosis butterfly vertebra hemivertebra and block vertebrae which are observed in most of the cases scoliosis is identified in more than half of these patients in most of the symptomatic patients the spinal cord is split into halves by a bony spicule or fibrous band each half being surrounded by a dural sac other conditions such as intramedullary tumors tethered cord dermoids lipoma syringomyelia hydromyelia and arnoldchiari malformations have been described in medical literature but they are exceptionally rare diastematomyelia usually occurs between 9th thoracic and 1st sacral levels of the spinal column with most being at the level of the upper lumbar vertebra cervical diastematomyelia is a very rare entity the extent or length of spinal cord involved varies from one affected individual to another in approximately 60 of patients with diastematomyelia the two hemicords each covered by an intact layer of pia arachnoid travel through a single subarachnoid space surrounded by a single dural sac each hemicord has its own anterior spinal artery this form of diastematomyelia is not accompanied by any bony spur or fibrous band and is rarely symptomatic unless hydromyelia or tethering is present the other 40 of patients have a bony spur or a fibrous band that passes through the two hemicords in these cases the dura and arachnoid are split into two separate dural and arachnoidal sacs each surrounding the corresponding hemicord which are not necessarily symmetric each hemicord contains a central canal one dorsal horn giving rise to a dorsal nerve root and one ventral horn giving rise to a ventral nerve root one study showed the bony spur typically situated at the most inferior aspect of the dural cleft they advised that if the imaging appears to show otherwise a second spur present in about 5 of patients with diastematomyelia is likely to be present the conus medullaris is situated below the l2 level in more than 75 of these diastematomyelia patients thickening of the filum terminale is seen in over half of the cases while the level of the cleft is variable it is most commonly found in the lumbar region the two hemicords usually reunite caudally to the cleft occasionally however the cleft will extend unusually low and the cord will end with two separate coni medullarae and two fila terminale diplomyelia the following definitions may help to understand some of the related entities diastematomyelia diastematomyelia is a congenital anomaly often associated with spina bifida in which the spinal cord is split into halves by a bony spicule or fibrous band each half being surrounded by a dural sac myeloschisis myeloschisis is a developmental anomaly characterized by a cleft spinal cord owing to failure of the neural plate to form a complete neural tube or to rupture of the neural tube after closure diplomyelia diplomyelia is a true duplication of spinal cord in which these are two dural sacs with two pairs of anterior and posterior nerve roots the signs and symptoms of diastematomyelia may appear at any time of life although the diagnosis is usually made in childhood cutaneous lesions or stigmata such as a hairy patch dimple hemangioma subcutaneous mass lipoma or teratoma override the affected area of the spine is found in more than half of cases neurological symptoms are nonspecific indistinguishable from other causes of cord tethering the symptoms are caused by tissue attachments that limit the movement of the spinal cord within the spinal column these attachments cause an abnormal stretching of the spinal cord the course of the disorder is progressive in children symptoms may include the stigmata mentioned above andor foot and spinal deformities weakness in the legs low back pain scoliosis and incontinence in adulthood the signs and symptoms often include progressive sensory and motor problems and loss of bowel and bladder control this delayed presentation of symptoms is related to the degree of strain placed on the spinal cord over time tethered spinal cord syndrome appears to be the result of improper growth of the neural tube during fetal development and is closely linked to spina bifida tethering may also develop after spinal cord injury and scar tissue can block the flow of fluids around the spinal cord fluid pressure may cause cysts to form in the spinal cord a condition called syringomyelia this can lead to additional loss of movement feeling or the onset of pain or autonomic symptoms cervical diastematomyelia can become symptomatic as a result of acute trauma and can cause major neurological deficits like hemiparesis to result from otherwise mild trauma  adult presentation in diastematomyelia is unusual with modern imaging techniques various types of spinal dysraphism are being diagnosed in adults with increasing frequency the commonest location of the lesion is at first to third lumbar vertebrae lumbosacral adult diastematomyelia is even rarer bony malformations and dysplasias are generally recognized on plain xrays mri scanning is often the first choice of screening and diagnosis mri generally give adequate analysis of the spinal cord deformities although it has some limitations in giving detailed bone anatomy combined myelographic and postmyelographic ct scan is the most effective diagnostic tool in demonstrating the detailed bone intradural and extradural pathological anatomy of the affected and adjacent spinal canal levels and of the bony spur prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of this anomaly is usually possible in the early to mid thirdtrimester an extra posterior echogenic focus between the fetal spinal laminae is seen with splaying of the posterior elements thus allowing for early surgical intervention and have a favorable prognosis prenate ultrasound could also detect whether the diastematomyelia is isolated with the skin intact or association with any serious neural tube defects progressive neurological lesions may result from the tethering cord syndrome fixation of the spinal cord by the diastematomyelia phenomenon or any of the associated disorders such as myelodysplasia dysraphia of the spinal cord surgerysurgical intervention is warranted in patients who present with new onset neurological signs and symptoms or have a history of progressive neurological manifestations which can be related to this abnormality the surgical procedure required for the effective treatment of diastematomyelia includes decompression surgery of neural elements and removal of bony spur this may be accomplished with or without resection and repair of the duplicated dural sacs resection and repair of the duplicated dural sacs is preferred since the dural abnormality may partly contribute to the tethering process responsible for the symptoms of this condition postmyelographic ct scanning provides individualized detailed maps that enable surgical treatment of cervical diastematomyelia first performed in 1983   observationasymptomatic patients do not require surgical treatment these patients should have regular neurological examinations since it is known that the condition can deteriorate if any progression is identified then a resection should be performed

V keutel syndrome ks is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by abnormal diffuse cartilage calcification hypoplasia of the midface peripheral pulmonary stenosis hearing loss short distal phalanges tips of the fingers and mild mental retardation    individuals with ks often present with peripheral pulmonary stenosis brachytelephalangism sloping forehead midface hypoplasia and receding chin it is associated with abnormalities in the gene coding for matrix gla protein mgp  being an autosomal recessive disorder it may be inherited from two unaffected abnormal mgpcarrying parents thus people who inherit two affected mgp genes will likely inherit ks it was first identified in 1972 as a novel rare genetic disorder sharing similar symptoms with chondrodysplasia punctata   multiple forms of chondrodysplasia punctata share symptoms consistent with ks including abnormal cartilage calcification forceful respiration brachytelephalangism hypotonia psychomotor delay and conductive deafness yet peripheral pulmonary stenosis remains unique to ks  no chromosomal abnormalities are reported in affected individuals suggesting that familial consanguinity relates to the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance also despite largely abnormal calcification of regions including the larynx tracheobronchial tree nose pinna anatomy and epiglottis patients exhibit normal serum calcium and phosphate levels    being an extremely rare autosomal genetic disorder differential diagnosis has only led to several cases since 1972 initial diagnosis lends itself to facial abnormalities including sloping forehead maxillary hypoplasia nasal bridge depression wide mouth dental maloclusion and receding chin  electroencephalography eeg computed tomography ct scanning and skeletal survey are further required for confident diagnosis commonly diffuse cartilage calcification and brachytelephalangism are identified by xradiation xray while peripheral pulmonary arterial stenosis hearing loss dysmorphic facies and mental retardation are confirmed with confidence by the aforementioned diagnostic techniques  diagnosis is often confirmed by several abnormalities of skeletal origin there is a sequential order of findings according to cormode et al which initiate in abnormal cartilage calcification and later brachytelephalangism  the uniqueness of brachytelephalangy in ks results in distinctively broadened and shortened first through fourth distal phalanges while the fifth distal phalanx bone remains unaffected  radiography also reveals several skeletal anomalies including facial hypoplasia resulting in underdevelopment of the nasal bridge with noticeably diminished alae nasi in addition to distinguishable facial features patients generally demonstrate shorter than average stature and general mild developmental delay many common effects sharing similarity with chondrodysplasia punctata stem from cartilaginous origin radiography reveals extensive diffuse cartilaginous calcification pulmonary angiography and soft tissue radiography often demonstrate significant cartilaginous ossification in the trachea and larynx with perichondral and endochondral centers significantly ossified in transformed cartilage  abnormal diffuse cartilaginous ossification is typically most pronounced in the auricles and cartilage of the trachea and larynx while peripheral pulmonary stenosis is frequently common in ks interestingly in consanguineous parents of children with ks one is often phenotypically normal while the other is positive for pulmonary stenosis perhaps emanating from diffuse laryngotracheal calcification patients often present with recurrent respiratory infection otitis media and sinusitis  apart from diffuse abnormal cartilaginous calcification in pulmonary and wiktotic systems patients develop significant arterial calcification throughout the body  such calcification is concomitant with various diseases including diabetes atherosclerosis and renal dysfunction while patients with oral anticoagulant use have significant aortic valve and coronary artery calcification   although not distinctive to ks echocardiogram analysis has revealed right ventricular hypertrophy resulting in severe pulmonary artery hypertension in several cases  keutel syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a novel lossoffunction mutation in the matrix gla protein gene mgp mgp protein resides in the extracellular matrix and is implicated in inhibiting calcification though the repression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 bmp2 mutations resulting in loss of consensus donor splice site at exon 2intron 2 junctions result in significant diffuse calcification of soft tissue cartilage  extensive diffuse cartilaginous calcification is present in mgpknockout mice manifesting in vascular media replacement with a cartilaginous chondrocytelike matrix and ultimately premature death  conversely over expression of extracellular mgp effectively abolishes calcification in chondrocytes suggesting that mgp may function in inhibiting passive calcification in soft tissues  recent evidence suggests mgp is a vitamin k dependent protein synthesized by chondrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells where it potentiates the inhibition of cartilaginous and arterial calcification thus potential vitamin k deficiency via nutritional deficiency or coumarinderivative use would render mgp uncarboxylated and inactive thus diminishing biological function   arterial calcification resulting from mgp inactivation results in inimical prognosis commonly seen in patients with diabetes atherosclerosis and renal dysfunction treatment is symptomatic often addressing indicators associated with peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis laryngotracheal calcification resulting in dyspnea and forceful breathing can be treated with bronchodilators including the short and longacting \u03b22agonists and various anticholinergics prognosis is good yet life expectancy depends on the severity and extent of diffuse pulmonary and arterial calcification

V hemifacial microsomia is a congenital disorder that affects the development of the lower half of the face most commonly the ears the mouth and the mandible it can occur on one side of the face or both if severe it can lead to difficulties in breathing obstructing the trachea and requiring a tracheotomy it is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts with an incidence in the range of 1 in 3500 to 4500  hemifacial microsomia shares many similarities with treacher collins syndrome   the condition is also known by various other names the condition develops during the fetal stage of pregnancy at approximately 4 weeks of gestation when some form of vascular problem leads to clotting and a poor supply of blood to the face this can be caused by a physical trauma though there is some evidence of it being hereditary   this restricts the developmental ability of that area of the face currently there are no definitive reasons for the development of the condition the clinical presentation of hemifacial microsomia hfm can be quite variable in some children just the ear is affected microtia or a small underdeveloped ear and in other children multiple parts of the face and body can be affected while there is no grading scale that is in use universally the omens scale standing for orbital mandible ear nerves and soft tissue was developed to help describe the heterogeneous phenotype that makes up this malformation children with hfm are at higher risk for hearing loss and should have their hearing tested a proportion of children with hfm will have extracranial anomalies including abnormalities of the kidneys and cervical spine which are important to detect early in childhood cognition and development is usually typical in children with hfm some have hypothesized that the severity of hemifacial microsomia depends on the extent of the physical injury the area with a short supply of blood and the gestational age of the fetus  the earlier the injury the greater the chance of widescale problems this has not yet been proven in an animal or human model pruzanksky classified hemifacial microsomia patients into three different types depending upon the treatment required it is sometimes most appropriate to wait until later in life for a surgical remedy  the childhood growth of the face may highlight or increase the symptoms when surgery is required particularly when there is a severe disfiguration of the jaw it is common to use a rib graft to help correct the shape according to literature hemifacial microsomia patients can be treated with various treatment options such functional therapy with an appliance distraction osteogenesis or costochondral graft the treatment is based on the type of severity for these patients according to pruzankskys classification if the patient has moderate to severe symptoms than surgery is preferred if patient has mild symptoms than a functional appliance is generally used  patients can also benefit from a bone anchored hearing aid baha

V a genetic chimærism or chimæra also spelled chimera not to be confused with the cartilaginous fish called chimaera from the creature chimæra in greek mythology is a single organism composed of cells from different zygotes this can result in male and female organs two blood types or subtle variations in form  animal chimæras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs in plant chimæras however the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same zygote and the difference is often due to mutation during ordinary cell division normally chimærism is not visible on casual inspection however it has been detected in the course of proving parentage  another way that chimærism can occur in animals is by organ transplantation giving one individual tissues that developed from two genomes for example a bone marrow transplant can change someones blood type   an animal chimæra is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction if the different cells have emerged from the same zygote the organism is called a mosaic chimæras are formed from at least four parent cells two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues there are some reports of human chimærism  this condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of allogeneic hæmatopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion in nonidentical twins chimærism occurs by means of bloodvessel anastomoses the likelihood of offspring being a chimæra is increased if it is created via in vitro fertilisation   chimæras can often breed but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male tetragametic chimærism is a form of congenital chimærism this condition occurs through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm followed by aggregation of the two at the blastocyst or zygote stages this results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines put another way the chimæra is formed from the merging of two nonidentical twins although a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins but as their dna is almost identical the presence would not be immediately detectable in a very early zygote or blastocyst phase as such they can be male female or have mixed intersex characteristics as the organism develops it can come to possess organs that have different sets of chromosomes for example the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes this has occurred in humans and at one time was thought to be extremely rare though more recent evidence suggests that it is not as rare as previously believed   this is particularly true for the marmoset recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras sharing dna with their fraternal twins  95 of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through chorionic fusions making them hematopoietic chimeras   most chimeras will go through life without realizing they are chimeras the difference in phenotypes may be subtle eg having a hitchhikers thumb and a straight thumb eyes of slightly different colors differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body etc or completely undetectable chimeras may also show under a certain spectrum of uv light distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back this is one expression of pigment unevenness called blaschkos lines  affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or if the zygotes are of opposite sex ambiguous genitalia and intersex alone or in combination such persons sometimes also have patchy skin hair or eye pigmentation heterochromia if the blastocysts are of opposite sex genitals of both sexes may be formed either ovary and testis or combined ovotestes in one rare form of intersex a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism note that the frequency of this condition does not indicate the true prevalence of chimerism most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body often most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line ie the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line and the internal organs of the other cell line genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics if the sex organs are homogeneous the individual will not be expected to exhibit any intersex traits natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as malefemale or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation the most noticeable are some male tortoiseshell cats or animals with ambiguous sex organs the existence of chimerism is problematic for dna testing a fact with implications for family and criminal law the lydia fairchild case for example was brought to court after dna testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged the charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that lydia was a chimera with the matching dna being found in her cervical tissue another case was that of karen keegan who was also suspected initially of not being her childrens biological mother after dna tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed seemed to show she wasnt their mother   the tetragametic state has important implications for organ or stemcell transplantation chimeras typically have immunologic tolerance to both cell lines microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older people who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mothers have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems the higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternallyderived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40 year old man with sclerodermalike disease an autoimmune rheumatic disease the female cells detected in his blood stream via fish fluorescence in situ hybridization were thought to be maternallyderived however his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin and whether or not microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well is unknown  women often also have a few cells genetically identical to that of their children and some people also have some cells genetically identical to that of their siblings maternal siblings only since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them chimerism occurs naturally in adult ceratioid anglerfish and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle once the male achieves adulthood it begins its search for a female using strong olfactory receptors ie smell receptors the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish the male less than an inch in length bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body fusing the pair down to the bloodvessel level while this attachment has become necessary for the males survival it will eventually consume him as both anglerfish fuse into a single hermaphroditic individual sometimes in this odd ritual more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote they will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler once fused to a female the males will reach sexual maturity developing large testicles as their other organs atrophy this process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring  germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells for example sperm and egg cells of an organism are not genetically identical to its own it has recently been discovered that marmosets can carry the reproductive cells of their fraternal twin siblings because of placental fusion during development marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins    in biological research chimeras are artificially produced by selectively transplanting embryonic cells from one organism onto the embryo of another and allowing the resultant blastocyst to develop chimeras are not hybrids which form from the fusion of gametes from two species that form a single zygote with a combined genetic makeup or hybridomas which as with hybrids result from fusion of two species cells into a single cell and artificial propagation of this cell in the laboratory essentially in a chimera each cell is from either of the parent species whereas in a hybrid and hybridoma each cell is derived from both parent species chimera is a broad term and is often applied to many different mechanisms of the mixing of cells from two different species as with cloning the process of creating and implanting a chimera is imprecise with the majority of embryos spontaneously terminating successes however have led to major advancements in the field of embryology as creating chimeras of one species with different physical traits such as colour has allowed researchers to trace the differentiation of embryonic cells through the formation of organ systems in the adult individual the first known primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins roku and hex each having 6 genomes they were created by mixing cells from totipotent 4 cell blastocysts although the cells never fused they worked together to form organs it was discovered that one of these primates roku was a sexual chimera as four percent of rokus blood cells contained two x chromosomes  a major milestone in chimera experimentation occurred in 1984 when a chimeric geep was produced by combining embryos from a goat and a sheep and survived to adulthood  the creation of the geep revealed several complexities to chimera development in implanting a goat embryo for gestation in a sheep the sheeps immune system would reject the developing goat embryo whereas a geep embryo sharing markers of immunity with both sheep and goats was able to survive implantation in either of its parent species in august 2003 researchers at the shanghai second medical university in china reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and rabbit ova to create the first human chimeric embryos the embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting then destroyed to harvest the resulting stem cells  in 2007 scientists at the university of nevada school of medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15 human cells and 85 sheep cells  chimeric mice are important tools in biological research as they allow the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it these include insights into such problems as the tissue specific requirements of a gene cell lineage and cell potential the general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins the first chimeric mouse was made by beatrice mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight cell stage embryos  injection on the other hand was pioneered by richard gardner and ralph brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected es cells  chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos es cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line es cells are also a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of homologous recombination thus allowing gene targeting since this discovery occurred in 1999 es cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice  the ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage it is composed of several parts mainly the trophectoderm the inner cell mass and the primitive endoderm each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo  two to eightcellstage embryos are competent for making chimeras since at these stages of development the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm in the case where two diploid eightcellstage embryos are used to make a chimera chimerism can be later found in the epiblast primitive endoderm and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst   it is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other for example subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo the inner cell mass of a diploid blastocyst for example can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eightcell diploid embryo the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse  from this knowledge es cell contributions to chimeras have been developed es cells can be used in combination with eightcelland twocellstage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera an example is the chimera built off of es cells and tetraploid embryos tetraploid embryos which are artificially made by electrofusion of two twocell diploid embryos the tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera   there are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and  according to the goal of the experiment  an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and es cells diploid embryo and diploid embryo es cell and tetraploid embryo diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo es cells and es cells the combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell these kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo if embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera the following procedure is common a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse by way of electroporation cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting and be able to be positively selected for   es cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst these injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouses es cells  this same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of es cells and diploid embryos diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit to these wells es cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse  the distinction between sectorial mericlinal and periclinal chimeras are widely used   these are produced by grafting tetically different parents different cultivars or different species which may belong to different genera the tissues may be partially fused together following grafting to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot  just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features so the behavior of their periclinal chimeras is like to be highly variable  the first such known chimera was probably the bizzaria which is a confusion of the florentine citron and the sour orange wellknown examples of a graftchimera are laburnocytisus adamii caused by a fusion of a laburnum and a broom and family trees where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a rootstock these are chimeras in which the layers differ in their chromosome constitution occasionally chimeras arise from loss or gain of individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments owing to misdivision  more commonly cytochimeras have simple multiple of the normal chromosome complement in the changed layer there are various effects on cell size and growth characteristics these chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a nuclear gene to a dominant or recessive allele as a rule one character is affected at a time in the leaf flower fruit or other parts these chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a plastid gene followed by the sortingout of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth alternatively after selfing or nucleic acid thermodynamics plastids may sortout from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively this type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sortingout pattern in the leaves after sortingout is complete periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear genedifferential chimeras by their nonmendelian inheritance the majority of variegatedleaf chimeras are of this kind all plastid gene and some nuclear genedifferential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves and these are grouped together as chlorophyll chimeras or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras for most variegation the mutation involved is the loss of the chloroplasts in the mutated tissue so that part of the plant tissue has no green pigment and no photosynthetic ability this mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own but is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes there are multiple reasons to explain the occurrence of plant chimera during plant recovery stage 1 the process of shoot organogenesis starts form the multicellular origin  2 the endogenous tolerance leads to the ineffectiveness of the weak selective agents 3 a selfprotection mechanism cross protection transformed cells serve as guards to protect the untransformed ones  4 the observable characteristic of transgenic cells may be a transient expression of the marker gene or it may due to the presence of agrobacterium cells untransformed cells should be easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras because its extremely important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations reporter genes such as gus and green fluorescent protein gfp are utilized in combination with plant selective markers herbicide antibody etc however gus expression depends on the plant development stage and gfp may be influenced by the green tissue autofluorescence quantitative pcr could be an alternative method for chimera detection  the us and western europe have strict codes of ethics and regulations in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells though there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework  through the creation of humanchimera comes the question where does society now draw the line of humanity this question poses serious legal and moral issues along with creating controversy chimpanzees for example are not offered any legal standing and if they pose a threat to humans are put down once a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human it may blur the ethical line between animal and man legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights  along with issues regarding the rights of chimera individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating humanchimera diminishes the dignity of being human   on may 2008 a robust debate in the house of commons of the united kingdom on the ethics of creating chimeras with human stem cells led to the decision that embryos would be allowed to be made in laboratories given that they would be destroyed within the first 14 days on 11 july 2005 a bill the human chimera prohibition act was introduced into the united states congress by senator samuel brownback however it died in congress sometime in the next year the bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life because of this serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between man and animal and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity the final claim brought up in the human chimera prohibition act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of humananimal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans  since the bills death in congress there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the united states

V a vestigial twin is a rare form of conjoined siamese twinning or more accurately of parasitic twinning where the parasitic twin is so malformed and incomplete that it typically consists entirely of extra limbs or organs this phenomenon occurs when a fertilized ovum or partially formed embryo splits incompletely the result can be anything from two whole people joined by a bit of skin conjoined  siamese twins to one person with extra body parts belonging to the vestigial twin most vestigial limbs are nonfunctional and although they may have bones muscles and nerve endings they are not under the control of the host the possession of six or more digits on the hands and feet polydactyly usually has a genetic or chromosomal cause and is not a case of vestigial twinning

V fibular hemimelia or longitudinal fibular deficiency is the congenital absence of the fibula and it is the most common congenital absence of long bone of the extremities   it is the shortening of the fibula at birth or the complete lack thereof in humans the disorder can be noted by ultrasound in utero to prepare for amputation after birth or complex bone lengthening surgery the amputation usually takes place at six months with removal of portions of the legs to prepare them for prosthetic use the other treatments which include repeated corrective osteotomies and leglengthening surgery are costly and associated with residual deformity    characteristics are partial or total absence of fibula is among the most frequent limb anomalies it is the most common long bone deficiency and is the most common skeletal deformity in the leg it most often is unilateral present only on one side paraxial fibular hemimelia is the most common manifestation in which only the postaxial portion of the limb is affected it is commonly seen as complete terminal deficiency where the lateral rays of the foot are also affected hemimelia can also be intercalary in which case the foot remains unaffected although the missing bone is easily identified this condition is not simply a missing bone  males are affected twice as often as females in most series   the cause of fibular hemimelia is unclear purportedly there have been some incidents of genetic distribution in a family however this does not account for all cases maternal viral infections embryonic trauma teratogenic environmental exposures or vascular dysgenesis failure of the embryo to form a satisfactory blood supply between four and seven weeks gestation are considered possible causes

V congenital trigger thumb or pediatric trigger thumb is a trigger thumb in neonates and young children triggering clicking or snapping is observed by flexion or extension of the interphalangeal joint ipj in the furthest stage no extension is possible and there is a fixed flexion deformity of the thumb in the ipj etiology natural history prognosis and recommended treatment are controversial   it is unclear whether the cause of the trigger thumb is congenital or acquired the occurrence of bilateral incidence and trigger thumbs in both children of twins are an indication for a congenital cause    trigger thumb in children is also associated with trisomy of chromosome 13  for these reasons it was assumed that trigger thumbs in children are to be of congenital cause however more and more evidence which point towards an acquired cause have been found in recent studies   therefore the name pediatric trigger thumb is also widely used and currently preferred by some for the same disorder not much research has been done on the epidemiology of congenital trigger thumbs there are a few reports on the incidence in their respective studies the most recent data comes from a japanese study by kukichi and ogino where they found an incidence 33 trigger thumbs per 1000 live births in 1 year old children  besides the clicking snapping or triggering a characteristic notta nodule is commonly found on the palmar side at the metacarpophalangeal mcp joint  this nodule can be found by palpation children can also present a thumb which they cannot extend actively due to entrapment of the nodule to the a1 pulley some may even present with a fixed flexion deformity of the ipj where no extension is possible diagnosis of a trigger thumb is solely made by these clinical observations and further classified into four stages   there are several types of treatment for congenital trigger thumb conservative and surgical the conservative treatment consists of observation in time studies show that the trigger thumb spontaneously resolves in 49 months  according to leung et al trigger thumbs in infants resolve spontaneously in 63 of the cases  no residual deformities were found and there is no recurrence once resolved  residual deformity is defined as persistent flexion deformities of the thumb and radial deviation at the ipj  extension exercises and splinting can be added to the observation these two elements have favourable results in improvement in flexion impairment of the thumb  however compared to observation the benefit of merely extension exercises and splinting are still unclear  it has been recommended to attempt conservative treatment first before attempting surgical treatment   surgical treatment should be considered when the patient has a trigger thumb bilaterally and when the patient has a severe trigger thumb severe is defined as when the thumb is locked so that the thumb cannot be flexed or extended either passively or actively surgical treatment should also be considered when observation andor splint therapy hasnt achieved sufficient results after 49 months  unlike the surgical treatment given for adults which is unambiguously a surgical release of the a1 pulley of the thumb the optimum surgical treatment for infants has not yet been discerned in case of infants research has shown that only in 15 of the cases a1 pulley release alone is sufficient  in most of the cases there was an additional annular pulley structure distal to the a1 to be released resolving the triggering the socalled av pulley or variable pulley   therefore infants and adults need to be treated differently as the main problem is different there are two types of surgery open surgery which is mentioned above and percutaneous surgery unlike open surgery percutaneous surgery is done without exposing the anatomical structures beneath the skin research has shown that percutaneous surgery is a good alternative to open surgery percutaneous surgery is done with a needle which is inserted in the flexor sheath at the level of the a1 pulley before the needle insertion the thumb is placed in extension whereas when the needle is already inserted the thumb will be put into semiflexion so that the needle can be moved and the palmar skin is movable the a1 pulley will then be cut with the needle longitudinally and parallel to the fibers of the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus muscle when the release with the needle is done according to the pivot maneuver the chances of incomplete release and damage to the digital nerve nearby will be increased to prevent any postoperative hematoma and swelling pressure should be applied for at least 10 minutes after the procedure percutaneous surgery has also been proven to be without residual deformities and recurrence after surgery when the a1 pulley is too thick and long to be release at once open surgery still can be a solution the advantages over open surgery are that percutaneous surgery is simpler more straightforward and shorter concerning the duration it can also be done in every other examination room unlike the open surgery which is done in an operation room the risk nonetheless is that the digital nerve of the thumb nearby can be damaged

V congenital disorder also known as congenital disease birth defect or anomaly  is a condition existing at or before birth regardless of cause of these diseases those characterized by structural deformities are termed congenital anomalies and involve defects in a developing fetus birth defects vary widely in cause and symptoms any substance that causes birth defects is known as a teratogen some disorders can be detected before birth through prenatal diagnosis screening birth defects may be the result of genetic or environmental factors this includes errors of morphogenesis infection epigenetic modifications on a parental germline or a chromosomal abnormality the outcome of the disorder will depend on complex interactions between the prenatal deficit and the postnatal environment  animal studies indicate that the mothers and likely the fathers diet vitamin intake and glucose levels prior to ovulation and conception have longterm effects on fetal growth and adolescent and adult disease  animal studies have shown that paternal exposures prior to conception and during pregnancy result in increased risk of certain birth defects and cancers this research suggests that paternal food deprivation germ line mutations alcohol use chemical mutagens age smoking habits and epigenetic alterations can affect birth outcomes     however the relationship between offspring health and paternal exposures age and lifestyle are still relatively weak this is likely because paternal exposures and their effects on the fetus are studied far less extensively than maternal exposures birth defects are present in about 3 of newborns in usa  congenital anomalies resulted in about 632000 deaths per year in 2013 down from 751000 in 1990  the type with the greatest death are congenital heart disease 323000 followed by neural tube defects 69000  much of the language used for describing congenital conditions predates genomic mapping and structural conditions are often considered separately from other congenital conditions it is now known that many metabolic conditions may have subtle structural expression and structural conditions often have genetic links still congenital conditions are often classified in a structural basis organized when possible by primary organ system affected several terms are used to describe congenital abnormalities some of these are also used to describe noncongenital conditions and more than one term may apply in an individual condition a limb anomaly is called a dysmelia these include all forms of limbs anomalies such as amelia ectrodactyly phocomelia polymelia polydactyly syndactyly polysyndactyly oligodactyly brachydactyly achondroplasia congenital aplasia or hypoplasia amniotic band syndrome and cleidocranial dysostosis congenital anomalies of the heart include patent ductus arteriosus atrial septal defect ventricular septal defect and tetralogy of fallot helen taussig has been a major force in research on congenital anomalies of the heart  congenital anomalies of the nervous system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida meningocele meningomyelocele encephalocele and anencephaly other congenital anomalies of the nervous system include the arnoldchiari malformation the dandywalker malformation hydrocephalus microencephaly megencephaly lissencephaly polymicrogyria holoprosencephaly and agenesis of the corpus callosum congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal system include numerous forms of stenosis and atresia and perforation such as gastroschisis congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract cakut include renal parenchyma kidneys and urinary collecting system  defects can be bilateral or unilateral and different defects often coexist in an individual child a congenital metabolic disease is also referred to as an inborn error of metabolism most of these are single gene defects usually heritable many affect the structure of body parts but some simply affect the function other well defined genetic conditions may affect the production of hormones receptors structural proteins and ion channels the mothers consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can cause a continuum of various permanent birth defects cranofacial abnormalities  brain damage  intellectual disability  heart disease kidney abnormality skeletal anomalies ocular abnormalities  the prevalence of children affected is estimated at least 1 percent in us  as well in canada very few studies have investigated the links between paternal alcohol use and offspring health  however recent animal research has shown a correlation between paternal alcohol exposure and decreased offspring birth weight behavioral and cognitive disorders including difficulties with learning and memory hyperactivity and lowered stress tolerance have been linked to paternal alcohol ingestion the compromised stress management skills of animals whose male parent was exposed to alcohol are similar to the exaggerated responses to stress that children with fetal alcohol syndrome display because of maternal alcohol use these birth defects and behavioral disorders were found in cases of both long and shortterm paternal alcohol ingestion   in the same animal study paternal alcohol exposure was correlated with a significant difference in organ size and the increased risk of the offspring displaying ventricular septal defects vsd at birth  vsd has also been correlated with paternal alcohol abuse in humans  substances whose toxicity can cause congenital disorders are called teratogens and include certain pharmaceutical and recreational drugs in pregnancy as well as many environmental toxins in pregnancy  a review published in 2010 identified 6 main teratogenic mechanisms associated with medication use folate antagonism neural crest cell disruption endocrine disruption oxidative stress vascular disruption and specific receptor or enzymemediated teratogenesis  it is estimated that 10 of all birth defects are caused by prenatal exposure to a teratogenic agent  these exposures include but are not limited to medication or drug exposures maternal infections and diseases and environmental and occupational exposures paternal smoking use has also been linked to an increased risk of birth defects and childhood cancer for the offspring where the paternal germ line undergoes oxidative damage due to cigarette use   teratogencaused birth defects are potentially preventable studies have shown that nearly 50 of pregnant women have been exposed to at least one medication during gestation  during pregnancy a female can also be exposed to teratogens from the contaminated clothing or toxins within the seminal fluid of a partner    an additional study found that of 200 individuals referred for genetic counseling for a teratogenic exposure 52 were exposed to more than one potential teratogen  the most notorious teratogenic drug is the thalidomide developed at the end of 1950 by chemie gr\u0171nenthal as a hypnotic and antiemetic and therefore frequently prescribed to pregnant women in almost 50 countries worldwide between 1956 1962  until william mcbride published the study leading to its withdrawal from the market at 1961 about 8 10 000 severely malformed children were born the most typical disorder induced by thalidomide were reductional deformities of the long bones of the extremities phocomelia otherwise a rare deformity which therefore helped to recognise the teratogenic effect of the new drug among other malformations caused by thalidomide were those of ears eyes brain kidney heart digestive and respiratory tract 40 of the prenatally affected children died soon after birth  as thalidomide is used today as a treatment for multiple myeloma and leprosy several births of affected children were described in spite of the strictly required use of contraception among female patients treated by it vitamin a or retinol is the sole vitamin which is embryotoxic even in a therapeutic dose for example in multivitamins because its metabolite the retinoic acid plays an important role as a signal molecule in the development of several tisues and organs its natural precursor the \u03b2carotene is considered safe whereas the consumption of animal liver can lead to malformation liver stores lipofile vitamines including retinol  isotretinoin 13cisretinoicacid brand name roaccutane vitamine a analog which is often used to treat severe acne is such a strong teratogen that just a single dose taken by a pregnant woman even transdermally may result in serious birth defects because of this effect most countries have systems in place to ensure that it is not given to pregnant women and that the patient is aware of how important it is to prevent pregnancy during and at least one month after treatment medical guidelines also suggest that pregnant women should limit vitamin a intake to about 700 \u03bcgday as it has teratogenic potential when consumed in excess   vitamine a and similar substances can induce spontaneous abortions premature births defects of eyes microphthalmia ears thymus face deformities neurological hydrocephalus microcephalia and cardiovascular defects as well as mental retardation  tetracycline an antibiotic should never be prescribed to women in the reproductive age or children because of its negative impact on bone mineralization and teeth mineralization the tetracycline teeth have brown or grey colour as a result of a defective development of both the dentine and the enamel of teeth  several anticonvulsants are known to be highly teratogenic phenytoin also known as diphenylhydantoin along with carbamazepine is responsible for the fetal hydantoin syndrome which may typically include broad nose base cleft lip andor palate microcephalia nails and fingers hypoplasia intrauterine growth restriction and mental retardation trimethadione taken during pregnancy is responsible for the fetal trimethadione syndrome characterized by craniofacial cardiovascular renal and spine malformations along with a delay in mental and physical development valproate has antifolate effects leading to neural tube closurerelated defects such as spina bifida lower iq and autism have recently also been reported as a result of intrauterine valproate exposure  hormonal contraception is considered as harmless for the embryo peterka and novotná  do however state that syntethic progestines used to prevent miscarriage in the past frequently caused masculinization of the outer reproductive organs of female newborns due to their androgenic activity diethylstilbestrol is a synthetic estrogen used from the 1940s to 1971 when the prenatal exposition has been linked to the clearcell adenocarcinoma of the vagina following studies showed elevated risks for other tumors and congenital malformations of the sex organs for both sexes all cytostatics are strong teratogenes abortion is usually recommended when pregnancy is found during or before chemotherapy aminopterin a cytostatic drug with antifolate effect was used during the 1950s and 1960s to induce therapeutic abortions in some cases the abortion didnt happen but the newborns suffered a fetal aminopterin syndrome consisting of growth retardation craniosynostosis hydrocephalus facial dismorphities mental retardation andor leg defomities   drinking water is often a vessel through which harmful toxins travel studies have shown that heavy metals elements nitrates nitrites fluoride can be carried through water and cause congenital disorders nitrate which is found mostly in drinking water from ground sources is a powerful teratogen a casecontrol study in rural australia that was conducted following frequent reports of prenatal mortality and congenital malformations found that those who drank the nitrateinfected groundwater as opposed to rain water ran the risk of giving birth to children with central nervous system disorders muscoskeletal defects and cardiac defects  chlorinated and aromatic solvents such as benzene and trichloroethylene sometimes enter the water supply due to oversights in waste disposal a casecontrol study on the area found that by 1986 leukemia was occurring in the children of woburn massachusetts at a rate that was four times the expected rate of incidence further investigation revealed a connection between the high occurrence of leukemia and an error in water distribution that delivered water to the town with significant contamination manufacturing waste containing trichloroethylene  as an endocrine disruptor the ddt was shown to induce miscarriages interfere with the development of the female reproductive system cause the congenital hypothyroidism and suspectibly childhood obesity  fluoride when transmitted through water at high levels can also act as a teratogen two reports on fluoride exposure from china which were controlled to account for the education level of parents found that children born to parents who were exposed to 412 ppm fluoride grew to have iqs that were on average seven points lower than their counterparts whose parents consumed water that contained 091 ppm fluoride in studies conducted on rats higher ppm fluoride in drinking water lead to increased acetylcholinesterase levels which can alter prenatal brain development the most significant effects were noted at a level of 5 ppm  the fetus is even more susceptible to damage from carbon monoxide intake which can be harmful when inhaled during pregnancy usually through first or secondhand tobacco smoke the concentration of carbon monoxide in the infant born to a nonsmoking mother is around 2 and this concentration drastically increases to a range of 69 if the mother smokes tobacco other possible sources of prenatal carbon monoxide intoxication are exhaust gas from combustion motors use of dichloromethane paint thinner varnish removers in enclosed areas defective gas hot water heaters indoor barbeques open flames in poorlyventilated areas atmospheric exposure in highly polluted areas exposure to carbon monoxide at toxic levels during the first two trimesters of pregnancy can lead to intrauterine growth restriction leading to a baby that has stunted growth and is born smaller than 90 of other babies at the same gestational age the effect of chronic exposure to carbon monoxide can depend on the stage of pregnancy in which the mother is exposed exposure during the embryonic stage can have neurological consequences such as telencephalic dysgenesis behavioral difficulties during infancy and reduction of cerebellum volume there are also possible skeletal defects that could result from exposure to carbon monoxide during the embryonic stage such as hand and foot malformations hip dysplasia hip subluxation agenisis of a limb and inferior maxillary atresia with glossoptosis also carbon monoxide exposure between days 35 and 40 of embryonic development can lead to an increased risk of the child developing a cleft palate exposure to carbon monoxide or polluted ozone exposure can also lead to cardiac defects of the ventrical septal pulmonary artery and heart valves  the effects of carbon monoxide exposure are decreased later in fetal development during the fetal stage but they may still lead to anoxic encephalopathy  industrial pollution can also lead to congenital defects over a period of 37 years the chisso corporation a petrochemical and plastics company contaminated the waters of minamata bay with an estimated 27 tons of methylmercury contaminating the local water supply this led to many people in the area developing what became known as the minamata disease because methylmercury is a teratogen the mercury poisoning of those residing by the bay resulted in neurological defects in the offspring infants exposed to mercury poisoning in utero showed predispositions to cerebral palsy ataxia inhibited psychomotor development and mental retardation  landfill sites have been shown to have adverse effects on fetal development extensive research has been shown that landfills have several negative effects on babies born to mothers living near landfill sites low birth weight birth defects spontaneous abortion and fetal and infant mortality studies done around the love canal site near niagara falls and the lipari landfill in new jersey have shown a higher proportion of low birth babies than communities farther away from landfills a study done in california showed a positive correlation between time and quantity of dumping and low birth weights and neonatal deaths a study in the united kingdom showed a correspondence between pregnant women living near landfill sites and an increased risk of congenital disorders such as neural tube defects hypospadias epispadia and abdominal wall defects such as gastroschisis and exomphalos a study conducted on a welsh community also showed an increase incidence of gastroschisis another study was done on twentyone european hazardous waste sites and showed that those living within three kilometers had an increased risk of giving birth to infants with birth defects and that as distance from the land increased the risk decreased these birth defects included neural tube defects malformations of the cardiac septa anomalies of arteries and veins and chromosomal anomalies  looking at communities that live near landfill sites brings up environmental justice a vast majority of sites are located near poor mostly black communities for example between the early 1920s and 1978 about 25 of houstons population was black however over 80 of landfills and incinerators during this time were located in these black communities  another issue regarding environmental justice is lead poisoning if the fetus is exposed to lead during the pregnancy this can result in learning difficulties and slowed growth a lot of paints before 1978 and pipes contain lead therefore pregnant women who live in homes with lead paint will inhale the dust containing lead leading to lead exposure in the fetus when lead pipes are used for drinking water and cooking water this water is ingested along with the lead exposing the fetus to this toxin this issue is more prevalent in poorer communities this is because more well off families are able to afford to have their homes repainted and pipes renovated  paternal smoking prior to conception has been linked with the increased risk of congenital abnormalities in offspring  smoking causes dna mutations in the germ line of the father which can be inherited by the offspring cigarette smoke acts as a chemical mutagen on germ cell dna the germ cells suffer oxidative damage and the effects can be seen in altered mrna production infertility issues and side effects in the embryonic and fetal stages of development this oxidative damage may result in epigenetic or genetic modifications of the fathers germ line research has shown that fetal lymphocytes have been damaged as a result of a fathers smoking habits prior to conception   correlations between paternal smoking and the increased risk of offspring developing childhood cancers including acute leukemia brain tumors and lymphoma before age five have been established however further research is needed to confirm these findings little is currently known about how paternal smoking damages the fetus and what window of time in which the father smokes is most harmful to offspring  a vertically transmitted infection is an infection caused by bacteria viruses or in rare cases parasites transmitted directly from the mother to an embryo fetus or baby during pregnancy or childbirth it can occur when the mother gets an infection as an intercurrent disease in pregnancy congenital disorders were initially believed to be the result of only hereditary factors however in the early 1940s australian pediatric ophthalmologist norman gregg began recognizing a pattern in which the infants arriving at his surgery were developing congenital cataracts at a higher rate than those who developed it from hereditary factors on october 15 1941 gregg delivered a paper which explained his findings68 out of the 78 children who were afflicted with congenital cataracts had been exposed in utero due to an outbreak in australian army camps these findings confirmed to gregg that there could in fact be environmental causes for congenital disorders currently rubella is known to cause abnormalities of the eye internal ear heart and sometimes the teeth more specifically fetal exposure to rubella during weeks five to ten of development the sixth week particularly can cause cataracts and microphthalmia in the eyes if the mother is infected with rubella during the ninth week a crucial week for internal ear development there can be destruction of the organ of corti causing deafness in the heart the ductus arteriosus can remain after birth leading to hypertension rubella can also lead to atrial and ventricular septal defects in the heart if exposed to rubella in the second trimester the fetus can develop central nervous system malformations however because infections of rubella may remain undetectedmisdiagnosed or unrecognized in the mother andor some abnormalities are not evident until later in the childs life precise incidence of birth defects due to rubella are not entirely known the timing of the mothers infection during fetal development determines the risk and type of birth defect as the embryo develops the risk of abnormalities decreases if exposed to the rubella virus during the first four weeks the risk of malformations is 47 percent exposure during weeks five through eight creates a 22 percent chance while weeks nine to twelve a seven percent chance exists followed by a percentage of six if the exposure is during the thirteenth to sixteenth weeks exposure during the first eight weeks of development can also lead to prematurity and fetal death these numbers are calculated from immediate inspection of the infant after birth therefore mental defects are not accounted for in the percentages because they are not evident until later in the childs life if they were to be included these numbers would be much higher  other infectious agents include cytomegalovirus the herpes simplex virus hyperthermia toxoplasmosis and syphilis mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly cerebral calcifications blindess chorioretinitis which can cause blindness hepatosplenomegaly and meningoencephalitis in fetuses  microcephaly is a disorder in which the fetus has an atypically small head  cerebral calcifications means certain areas of the brain have atypical calcium deposits  and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain all three disorders cause abnormal brain function or mental retardation hepatosplenomegaly is the enlargement of the liver and spleen which causes digestive problems  it can also cause some kernicterus and petechiae kernicterus causes yellow pigmentation of the skin brain damage and deafness  petechaie is when the capillaries bleed resulting in redpurple spots on the skin  however cytomegalovirus is often fatal in the embryo the herpes simplex virus can cause microcephaly microphthalmus abnormally small eyeballs  retinal dysplasia hepatosplenomegaly and mental retardation  both microphthalmus and retinal dysplasia can cause blindness however the most common symptom in infants is an inflammatory response that develops during the first three weeks of life  hyperthermia causes anencephaly which is when part of the brain and skull are absent in the infant   mother exposure to toxoplasmosis can cause cerebral calcification hydrocephalus causes mental disabilities  and mental retardation in infants other birth abnormalities have been reported as well such as chorioretinitis microphthalmus and ocular defects syphilis causes congenital deafness mental retardation and diffuse fibrosis in organs such as the liver and lungs if the embryo is exposed  for example a lack of folic acid a vitamin b in the diet of a mother can cause cellular neural tube deformities that result in spina bifida congenital disorders such as a neural tube deformity ntd can be prevented by 72 if the mother consumes 4 milligrams of folic acid before the conception and after 12 weeks of pregnancy  folic acid or vitamin b12 aids the development of the foetal nervous system  studies with mice have found that food deprivation of the male mouse prior to conception leads to the offspring displaying significantly lower blood glucose levels  external physical shocks or constrainment due to growth in a restricted space may result in unintended deformation or separation of cellular structures resulting in an abnormal final shape or damaged structures unable to function as expected an example is potter syndrome due to oligohydramnios this finding is important for future understandings of how genetics may predispose individuals for diseases like obesity diabetes and cancer for multicellular organisms that develop in a womb the physical interference or presence of other similarly developing organisms such as twins can result in the two cellular masses being integrated into a larger whole with the combined cells attempting to continue to develop in a manner that satisfies the intended growth patterns of both cell masses the two cellular masses can compete with each other and may either duplicate or merge various structures this results in conditions such as conjoined twins and the resulting merged organism may die at birth when it must leave the lifesustaining environment of the womb and must attempt to sustain its biological processes independently genetic causes of congenital anomalies include inheritance of abnormal genes from the mother or the father as well as new mutations in one of the germ cells that gave rise to the fetus male germ cells mutate at a much faster rate than female germ cells and as the father ages the dna of the germ cells mutates quickly   if an egg is fertilized with sperm that has damaged dna there is a possibility that the fetus could develop abnormally   genetic disorders or diseases are all congenital though they may not be expressed or recognized until later in life genetic diseases may be divided into singlegene defects multiplegene disorders or chromosomal defects singlegene defects may arise from abnormalities of both copies of an autosomal gene a recessive disorder or of only one of the two copies a dominant disorder some conditions result from deletions or abnormalities of a few genes located contiguously on a chromosome chromosomal disorders involve the loss or duplication of larger portions of a chromosome or an entire chromosome containing hundreds of genes large chromosomal abnormalities always produce effects on many different body parts and organ systems a low socioeconomic status in a deprived neighborhood may include exposure to environmental stressors and risk factors  socioeconomic inequalities are commonly measured by the cartairsmorris score index of multiple deprivation townsend deprivation index and the jarman score  the jarman score for example considers unemployment overcrowding single parents underfives elderly living alone ethnicity low social class and residential mobility  in vos metaanalysis these indices are used to view the effect of low ses neighborhoods on maternal health in the metaanalysis data from individual studies were collected from 1985 up until 2008  vos concludes that a correlation exists between prenatal adversities and deprived neighborhoods  other studies have shown that low ses is closely associated with the development of the fetus in utero and growth retardation  studies also suggest that children born in low ses families are likely to be born prematurely at low birth weight or with asphyxia a birth defect a disability fetal alcohol syndrome or aids  bradley and corwyn also suggest that congenital disorders arise from the mothers lack of nutrition a poor lifestyle maternal substance abuse and living in a neighborhood that contains hazards affecting fetal development toxic waste dumps  in a metaanalysis that viewed how inequalities influenced maternal health it was suggested that deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors such as smoking drug and alcohol use  after controlling for socioeconomic factors and ethnicity several individual studies demonstrated an association with outcomes such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth  for the survivors of the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki who are known as the hibakusha no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defectscongenital malformations was found among their later conceived children or found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received radiotherapy      the surviving women of hiroshima and nagasaki who were able to conceive though exposed to substantial amounts of radiation went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalitiesbirth defects than in the japanese population as a whole   relatively few studies have researched the effects of paternal radiation exposure on offspring following the chernobyl disaster it was found that the germ line of irradiated fathers suffered minisatellite mutations in the dna which was inherited by descendants   animal studies have show that the xray irradiation of male mice resulted in birth defects of the offspring  in the 1980s a relatively high prevalence of pediatric leukemia cases in children living near a nuclear processing plant in west cumbria uk led researchers to investigate whether the cancer was a result of paternal radiation exposure a significant association between paternal irradiation and offspring cancer was found but further research in different areas of nuclear processing plants did not heed the same results   the effects of paternal age on offspring are not yet well understood and are studied far less extensively than the effects of maternal age  fathers contribute proportionally more dna mutations to their offspring via their germ cells than the mother with the paternal age governing how many mutations are passed on this is because as humans age male germ cells acquire mutations at a much faster rate than female germ cells    around a 5 increase in the incidence of ventricular septal defects atrial septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus in offspring has been found to be correlated with advanced paternal age advanced paternal age has also been linked to increased risk of achondroplasia and apert syndrome offspring born to fathers under the age of 20 show increased risk of being affected by patent ductus arteriosus ventricular septal defects and the tetralogy of fallot it is hypothesized that this may be due to environmental exposures or lifestyle choices  research has found that there is a correlation between advanced paternal age and risk of birth defects such as limb anomalies syndromes involving multiple systems and downs syndrome    recent studies have concluded that 59 of downs syndrome cases are due to paternal effects but these findings are controversial     there is concrete evidence that advanced paternal age is associated with the increased likelihood that a mother will suffer from a miscarriage or that fetal death will occur  although significant progress has been made in identifying the etiology of some birth defects approximately 65 have no known or identifiable cause  these are referred to as sporadic a term that implies an unknown cause random occurrence regardless of maternal living conditions  and a low recurrence risk for future children for 2025 of anomalies there seems to be a multifactorial cause meaning a complex interaction of multiple minor genetic anomalies with environmental risk factors another 1013 of anomalies have a purely environmental cause eg infections illness or drug abuse in the mother only 1225 of anomalies have a purely genetic cause of these the majority are chromosomal anomalies  congenital anomalies resulted in about 632000 deaths per year in 2013 down from 751000 in 1990  the type with the greatest death are congenital heart disease 323000 followed by neural tube defects 69000  many studies have found that the frequency of occurrence of certain congenital malformations depends on the sex of the child table      for example pyloric stenosis occurs more often in males while congenital hip dislocation is four to five times more likely to occur in females among children with one kidney there are approximately twice as many males whereas among children with three kidneys there are approximately 25 times more females the same pattern is observed among infants with excessive number of ribs vertebrae teeth and other organs which in a process of evolution have undergone reductionamong them there are more females contrarily among the infants with their scarcity there are more males anencephaly is shown to occur approximately twice as frequently in females  the number of boys born with 6 fingers is two times higher than the number of girls  now various techniques are available to detect congenital anomalies in fetus before birth  about 3 of newborns have a major physical anomaly meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance  physical congenital abnormalities are the leading cause of infant mortality in the united states accounting for more than 20 of all infant deaths seven to ten percent of all children  will require extensive medical care to diagnose or treat a birth defect  p m rajewski and a l sherman 1976 have analyzed the frequency of congenital anomalies in relation to the system of the organism prevalence of men was recorded for the anomalies of phylogenetically younger organs and systems  in respect of an etiology sexual distinctions can be divided on appearing before and after differentiation of males gonads in during embryonic development which begins from eighteenth week the testosterone level in male embryos thus raises considerably  the subsequent hormonal and physiological distinctions of male and female embryos can explain some sexual differences in frequency of congenital defects it is difficult to explain the observed differences in the frequency of birth defects between the sexes by the details of the reproductive functions or the influence of environmental and social factors the cdc and national birth defect project studied the incidence of birth defects in the us key findings include

V plagiocephaly also known as flat head syndrome   is a condition characterized by an asymmetrical distortion flattening of one side of the skull it is characterized by a flat spot on the back or one side of the head caused by remaining in a supine position for too long  etymology greek plagios oblique slanting from pie plag flat spread from plak  and cephal modern latin head skull brain  together means flat head plagiocephaly is the word that is used to describe a diagonal asymmetry across the head shape this word particularly describes a flattening which is to one side at the back of the head and there is often some facial asymmetry plagiocephaly divides into two groups synostotic plagiocephaly with one or more fused cranial sutures and nonsynostotic deformational plagiocephaly surgical treatment of these groups includes the deference method however the treatment of deformational plagiocephaly is controversial  brachycephaly describes a very wide head shape with a flattening across the whole back of the head   slight plagiocephaly is routinely diagnosed at birth and may be the result of a restrictive intrauterine environment giving a diamond shaped head when seen from above if there is premature union of skull bones this is more properly called craniosynostosis  the incidence of plagiocephaly has increased dramatically since the advent of antisudden infant death syndrome recommendations for parents to keep their babies on their backs  treatments range from a simple repositioning of babies below the age of 5 months to more involved treatment with a helmet for children under the age of 18 months  preliminary research indicates that some babies with plagiocephaly may comprise a highrisk group for developmental difficulties    following tools and therapy could serve as an effective and safe treatment modality on managing this development disorder such as the condition will usually improve to some extent as the baby grows but in many cases treatment can significantly improve the shape of a babys head initially treatment usually takes the form of reducing the pressure on the affected area through repositioning of the baby onto his or her abdomen for extended periods of time throughout the day  other treatments include repositioning the childs head throughout the day so that the rounded side of the head is placed dependent against the mattress repositioning cribs and other areas that infants spend time in so that they will have to look in a different direction to see their parents or others in the room repositioning mobiles and other toys for similar reasons and avoiding extended time sleeping in carseats when not in a vehicle bouncy seats or other supine seating which is thought to exacerbate the problem if the child appears to have discomfort or cries when they are repositioned they may have a problem with the neck  if this is unsuccessful treatment using a cranial remolding orthosis baby helmet can help to correct abnormal head shapes these helmets are used to treat deformational plagiocephaly brachycephaly scaphocephaly and other head shape deformities in infants 318 months of age by gently allowing the head shape to grow back into a normal shape this type of treatment although in some countries controversial have a long and successful history in radically improving the head shape  studies by researchers in the netherlands reported that there was no significant difference over time between infants treated with helmets and infants left untreated this randomised study followed 42 infants in a treated and 42 in a non treated group of the infants in the treated group only 30 were fitted with orthoses 22 of the 30 reported problems with the fit of the helmet the parents of infants treated with helmets confirmed negative side effects including skin irritation sweating unpleasant odor from helmet and feeling hindered from cuddling their child   this study focused on patients with moderate to severe cases the participation rate was only 21 84 of a total 403 eligible infants and there was a 73 reporting of fitting issues  calling into question the problems in the study incorrectly fit devices cannot be expected to yield results additionally independent published research that examined the effectiveness of helmet therapy conclude that as many as 95 of patients demonstrate an improvement in head shape symmetry following helmet therapy and the american orthotics and prosthetics association aopa has serious concerns about the relevance and validity of this study  this study is at odds with the results proved in all other studies and reduces its data to two lines of aggregated results a recent study at alder hey childrens hospital aimed to document changes in head shape associated with use of a passive orthotic mattress for the management of positional plagiocephaly the study of 30 patients with plagiocephaly at alder hey childrens hospital took place between april 2008 and june 2010 cranial vault asymmetry was assessed before treatment and was classified into mild moderate or severe plagiocephaly followup after 6 months of using the sleepcurve mattress demonstrated a significant improvement in cranial vault asymmetry in those treated with the passive orthotic mattress  whilst this type of mattress is useful in helping to prevent a deformity there is less evidence to show that it will improve an existing deformity

V pulmonary hypoplasia is incomplete development of the lungs resulting in an abnormally low number or size of bronchopulmonary segments or alveoli a congenital malformation it most often occurs secondary to other fetal abnormalities that interfere with normal development of the lungs primary idiopathic pulmonary hypoplasia is rare and usually not associated with other maternal or fetal abnormalities incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia ranges from 911 per 10000 live births and 14 per 10000 births  pulmonary hypoplasia is a common cause of neonatal death  it also is a common finding in stillbirths although not regarded as a cause of these   causes of pulmonary hypoplasia include a wide variety of congenital malformations and other conditions in which pulmonary hypoplasia is a complication  these include congenital diaphragmatic hernia congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation fetal hydronephrosis caudal regression syndrome mediastinal tumor and sacrococcygeal teratoma with a large component inside the fetus     large masses of the neck such as cervical teratoma also can cause pulmonary hypoplasia presumably by interfering with the fetuss ability to fill its lungs in the presence of pulmonary hypoplasia the exit procedure to rescue a baby with a neck mass is not likely to succeed  fetal hydrops can be a cause  or conversely a complication  pulmonary hypoplasia is associated with oligohydramnios through multiple mechanisms both conditions can result from blockage of the urinary bladder blockage prevents the bladder from emptying and the bladder becomes very large and full the large volume of the full bladder interferes with normal development of other organs including the lungs pressure within the bladder becomes abnormally high causing abnormal function in the kidneys hence abnormally high pressure in the vascular system entering the kidneys this high pressure also interferes with normal development of other organs an experiment in rabbits showed that ph also can be caused directly by oligohydramnios  pulmonary hypoplasia is associated with dextrocardia of embryonic arrest in that both conditions can result from early errors of development resulting in congenital cardiac disorders ph is a common direct cause of neonatal death resulting from pregnancy induced hypertension  medical diagnosis of pulmonary hypoplasia in utero may use imaging usually ultrasound or mri   the extent of hypoplasia is a very important prognostic factor  one study of 147 fetuses 49 normal 98 with abnormalities found that a simple measurement the ratio of chest length to trunk torso length was a useful predictor of postnatal respiratory distress  in a study of 23 fetuses subtle differences seen on mris of the lungs were informative  in a study of 29 fetuses with suspected pulmonary hypoplasia the group that responded to maternal oxygenation had a more favorable outcome  pulmonary hypoplasia is diagnosed also clinically management has three components interventions before delivery timing and place of delivery and therapy after delivery in some cases fetal therapy is available for the underlying condition this may help to limit the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia in exceptional cases fetal therapy may include fetal surgery   a 1992 case report of a baby with a sacrococcygeal teratoma sct reported that the sct had obstructed the outlet of the urinary bladder causing the bladder to rupture in utero and fill the babys abdomen with urine a form of ascites the outcome was good the baby had normal kidneys and lungs leading the authors to conclude that obstruction occurred late in the pregnancy and to suggest that the rupture may have protected the baby from the usual complications of such an obstruction  subsequent to this report use of a vesicoamniotic shunting procedure vasp has been attempted with limited success    often a baby with a high risk of pulmonary hypoplasia will have a planned delivery in a specialty hospital such as in the united states a tertiary referral hospital with a level 3 neonatal intensivecare unit the baby may require immediate advanced resuscitation and therapy  early delivery may be required in order to rescue the fetus from an underlying condition that is causing pulmonary hypoplasia however pulmonary hypoplasia increases the risks associated with preterm birth because once delivered the baby requires adequate lung capacity to sustain life the decision whether to deliver early includes a careful assessment of the extent to which delaying delivery may increase or decrease the pulmonary hypoplasia it is a choice between expectant management and active management an example is congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation with hydrops impending heart failure may require a preterm delivery  severe oligohydramnios of early onset and long duration as can occur with early preterm rupture of membranes can cause increasingly severe ph if delivery is postponed by many weeks ph can become so severe that it results in neonatal death  after delivery most affected babies will require supplemental oxygen some severely affected babies may be saved with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo  not all specialty hospitals have ecmo and ecmo is considered the therapy of last resort for pulmonary insufficiency  an alternative to ecmo is highfrequency oscillatory ventilation  in 1908 maude abbott documented pulmonary hypoplasia occurring with certain defects of the heart  in 1915 abbott and j c meakins showed that pulmonary hypoplasia was part of the differential diagnosis of dextrocardia  in 1920 decades before the advent of prenatal imaging the presence of pulmonary hypoplasia was taken as evidence that diaphragmatic hernias in babies were congenital not acquired

V genu valgum commonly called knockknee is a condition in which the knees angle in and touch one another when the legs are straightened individuals with severe valgus deformities are typically unable to touch their feet together while simultaneously straightening the legs the term originates from the latin genu knee and valgus which actually means bent outwards but in this case it is used to describe the distal portion of the knee joint which bends outwards and thus the proximal portion seems to be bent inwards for citation and more information on uses of the words valgus and varus please visit the internal link to varus mild genu valgum is diagnosed when a person standing upright with the feet touching also shows the knees touching it can be seen in children from ages 2 to 5 and is often corrected naturally as children grow however the condition may continue or worsen with age particularly when it is the result of a disease such as rickets or obesity idiopathic genu valgum is a form that is either congenital or has no known cause other systemic conditions may be associated such as schnyder crystalline corneal dystrophy an autosomal dominant condition frequently reported with hyperlipidemia   the degree of genu valgum can be estimated by the q angle which is the angle formed by a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine through the center of the patella and a line drawn from the center of the patella to the center of the tibial tubercle in women the q angle should be less than 22 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 9 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion in men the q angle should be less than 18 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 8 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion a typical q angle is 12 degrees for men and 17 degrees for women  persons with knock knees often have collapsed inner arches of their feet and their inner ankle bones are generally lower than their outer ankle bones adults with uncorrected genu valgum are typically prone to injury and chronic knee problems such as chondromalacia and osteoarthritis these in turn can cause severe pain and problems in walking it is normal for children to have knock knees between the ages of two and five years of age and almost all of them resolve as the child grows older if symptoms are prolonged and pronounced or hereditary doctors often use orthotic shoes or leg braces at night to gently move a childs leg back into position if the conditions persists and worsens later in life surgery may be required to relieve pain and complications resulting from severe or hereditary genu valgum available surgical procedures include adjustments to the lower femur and total knee replacement tkr weight loss and substitution of lowimpact for highimpact exercise can help slow progression of the condition with every step the patients weight places a distortion on the knee toward a knocked knee position and the effect is increased with increased angle or increased weight even in the normal knee position the femurs function at an angle because they connect to the hip girdle at points much further apart than they connect at the knees physical therapy is generally of benefit to people with knock knees to correct knock knees the entire leg must be treated especially working with a physical medicine specialist such as a physiatrist or a physiotherapistmay assist a patient learning how to improve outcomes and use the leg muscles properly to support the bone structures alternative or complementary treatments may include certain procedures from iyengar yoga or the feldenkrais method rarely the bone malformation underlying knock knees can be traced to a lack of nutrition necessary for bone growth which can cause conditions such as rickets lack of bone nutrients especially dietary vitamin d and calcium or scurvy lack of vitamin c the correction of the underlying vitamin deficiency may restore a more normal progression of bone growth

V smithfinemanmyers syndrome sfms1 also called xlinked mental retardationhypotonic facies syndrome 1 mrxhf1 carpenterwaziri syndrome chudleylowry syndrome sfms holmesgang syndrome and jubergmarsidi syndrome jms  is a rare xlinked recessive  congenital disorder that causes birth defects this syndrome was named after 3 men richard d smith robert m fineman and gart g myers who discovered it around 1980    sfms is an xlinked disease by chromosome xq13 xlinked diseases map to the human x chromosome because this syndrome is an x chromosome linked females who have two chromosomes are not affected but because males only have one x chromosome they are more likely to be affected and show the full clinical symptoms this disease only requires one copy of the abnormal xlinked gene to display the syndrome since females have two x chromosomes the effect of one x chromosome is recessive and the second chromosome masks the affected chromosome  affected fathers can never pass this xlinked disease to their sons but affected fathers can pass the xlinked gene to their daughters who has a 50 chance to pass this diseasecausing gene to each of her children since females who inherit this gene do not show symptoms they are called carriers each of the females carriers son has a 50 chance to display the symptoms but none of the female carriers daughters would display any symptoms  some patients with sfms have been founded to have a mutation of the gene in the atrx on the x chromosome also known as the xq13 location atrx is a gene disease that is associated with other forms of xlinked mental retardation like alphathalassemiamental retardation syndrome carpenter syndrome jubergmarsidi syndrome and soastic paraplegia it is possible that patients with sfms have alphathalassemiamental retardation syndrome without the affected hemoglobin h that leads to alphathalassemia mental retardation syndrome in the traditionally recognized disease  sfms affects the skeletal and nervous system this syndromes external signs would be an unusual facial appearance with their heads being slightly smaller and unusually shaped a narrow face which is also called dolichocephaly a large mouth with a drooping lower lip that are held open protruding upper jaw widely spaced upper front teeth an underdeveloped chin cleft palate and exotropiedslanted eyes with drooping eyelids males who have sfms have short stature and a thin body build also skin is lightly pigmented with multiple freckles they may have scoliosis and chest abnormalities affected boys have reduced muscle tone as infants and young children xrays sometimes show that their bones are underdeveloped and show characteristics of younger bones of children boys usually under the age of 10 have reduced muscle tone but later patients with sfms over the age of 10 have increased muscle tone and reflexes that cause spasticity their hands are short with unusual palm creases with short shaped fingers and foot abnormalities are shortened and have fused toes and usually mild they have an absent of a spleen and the genitals may also show undescended testes ranging from mild to severe that leads to female gender assignment people who have sfms have severe mental retardation they are sometimes restless behavior problems seizures and severe delay in language development they are selfabsorbed with reduced ability to socialize with others around them they also have psychomotor retardation which is the slowingdown of thoughts and a reduction of physical movements they have cortical atrophy or degeneration of the brains outer layer cortical atrophy is usually founded in older affected people  the assessment for smithfinemenmyers syndrome like any other mental retardation includes a detailed family history and physical exam that tests the mentality of the patient the patient also gets a brain and skeletal imaging though ct scans or xrays they also does a chromosome study and certain other genetic biochemical tests to help figure out any other causes for the mental retardation the diagnosis of sfms is based on visible and measurable symptoms until 2000 sfms was not known to be associated with any particular gene as of 2001 scientists do not yet know if other genes are involved in this rare disease generic analysis of the atrx gene may prove to be helpful in diagnosis of sfms  treatments are usually based on the individuals symptoms that are displayed the seizures are controlled with anticonvulsant medication for the behavior problems the doctors proscribe to a few medications and behavioral modification routines that involve therapists and other types of therapy even if mental retardation is severe it does not seem to shorten the lifespan of the patient or to get worse with age on september 15 1991 in sydney australia at the prince of wales childrens hospital reported on two brothers with a distinct facial appearance severe mental retardation short stature cryptorchidism undescended testicle asplenia in one absent spleen dramatic failure to thrive early hypotonia and later hypertonia all suggestive of the smithfinemanmyers syndrome all five of the reported cases have been males suggesting xlinked inheritance  on september 23 1998 at the hospital injury research and rehabilitation at the university of são paulo in bauru brazil report on two boys monozygotic twins born to normal and non consanguineous parents presenting with an unusual facial appearance cortical atrophy dolichocephaly short stature cleft palate micrognathia prominent upper central incisors bilateral sidney line minor foot deformities unstableness in walking early hypotonia hyperreflexia hyperactivity psychomotor retardation and severe delay in language development these symptoms resemble those previously described in the smithfinemanmyers syndrome

V congenital myasthenic syndrome cms is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by defects of several types at the neuromuscular junction the effects of the disease are similar to lamberteaton syndrome and myasthenia gravis the difference being that cms is not an autoimmune disorder   the types of cms are classified into three categories presynaptic postsynaptic and synaptic onset symptoms for all ages may include droopy eyelids a particular form of postsynaptic cms slowchannel cms includes severe weakness beginning in infancy or childhood that progresses and leads to loss of mobility and respiratory problems in adolescence or later life cms is associated with genetic defects that affect proteins of the neuromuscular junction postsynaptic defects are the most frequent cause of cms and often result in abnormalities in the acetylcholine receptor achr in the neuromuscular junction there is a vital pathway that maintains synaptic structure and results in the aggregation and localization of achr on the postsynaptic folds this pathway consists of agrin musclespecific tyrosine kinase musk acetylcholine receptors achrs and the achrclustering protein rapsyn encoded by the rapsn gene the vast majority of mutations causing cms are found in the achr subunits and rapsyn genes  out of all mutations associated with cms more than half are mutations in one of the four genes encoding the adult acetylcholine receptor achr subunits mutations of the achr often result in endplate deficiency most of the mutations of the achr are mutations of the chrne gene the chrne gene codes for the epsilon subunit of the achr most mutations are autosomal recessive lossoffunction mutations and as a result there is endplate achr deficiency chrne is associated with changing the kinetic properties of the achr  one type of mutation of the epsilon subunit of the achr introduces an arginine into the binding site at the \u03b1\u03b5 subunit interface of the receptor the addition of a cationic arg into the anionic environment of the achr binding site greatly reduces the kinetic properties of the receptor the result of the newly introduced arg is a 30fold reduction of agonist affinity 75fold reduction of gating efficiency and an extremely weakened channel opening probability this type of mutation results in an extremely fatal form of cms  another common underlying mechanism of cms is the mutation of the rapsyn protein coded by the rapsn gene rapsyn interacts directly with the achrs and plays a vital role in agrininduced clustering of the achr without rapsyn functional synapses cannot be created as the folds do not form properly patients with cmsrelated mutations of the rapsyn protein typically are either homozygous for n88k or heterozygous for n88k and a second mutation the major effect of the mutation n88k in rapsyn is to reduce the stability of achr clusters the second mutation can be a determining factor in the severity of the disease  studies have shown that most patients with cms that have rapsyn mutations carry the common mutation n88k on at least one allele however research has revealed that there is a small population of patients who do not carry the n88k mutation on either of their alleles but instead have different mutations of the rapsn gene that codes for rapsyn on both of their alleles two novel missense mutations that have been found are r164c and l283p and the result is a decrease in coclustering of achr with raspyn a third mutation is the intronic base alteration ivs115ca and it causes abnormal splicing of rapsn rna these results show that diagnostic screening for cms mutations of the rapsn gene cannot be based exclusively on the detection of n88k mutations  dok7 is a postsynaptic protein that binds and activates musk protein which then leads to achr clustering and typical folding of the postsynaptic membrane mutations of dok7 are another underlying mechanism of postsynaptic cms  congenital myasthenic syndrome cms is often difficult to diagnose because of a broad differential diagnosis and lack of specific laboratory findings identification of the underlying mutation is critical as certain mutations lead to treatmentresponsive conditions while others do not  whole exome sequencing wes is often used as a diagnostic tool that allows for the initiation of specific treatment  treatment depends on the form category of the disease although symptoms are similar to myasthenia gravis treatments used in mg are not useful in cms mg is treated with immunosuppressants but cms is not an autoimmune disorder instead cms is genetic and responds to other forms of drug treatments a form of presynaptic cms is caused by an insufficient release of acetylcholine ach and is treated with cholinesterase inhibitors postsynaptic fastchannel cms ach receptors do not stay open long enough is treated with cholinesterase inhibitors and 34diaminopyridine   in the us the more stable phosphate salt formulation of 34diaminopyridine amifampyridine is under development as an orphan drug for cms and is available to eligible patients at no cost under an expanded access program      postsynaptic slowchannel cms is treated with quinidine or fluoxetine which plugs the ach receptor ephedrine has been tested on patients in clinical trials and appears to be an effective treatment for dok7 cms most patients tolerate this type of treatment and improvements in strength can be impressive further research must be done in order to determine the longterm response of ephedrine as well as the most effective dosage regimen ephedrine also known as oral salbutamol can lead to a profound improvement in muscle strength and an even more impressive effect on daytoday function the effect of ephedrine is delayed and the improvement occurs over a period of months  ephedrine was given at doses between 15 and 90mgday and as a result muscle strength improved

V anencephaly is the absence of a major portion of the brain skull and scalp that occurs during embryonic development  it is a cephalic disorder that results from a neural tube defect that occurs when the rostral head end of the neural tube fails to close usually between the 23rd and 26th day following conception  strictly speaking the greek term translates as no inhead that is totally lacking the inside part of the head ie the brain but it is accepted that children born with this disorder usually only lack a telencephalon  the largest part of the brain consisting mainly of the cerebral hemispheres including the neocortex which is responsible for cognition the remaining structure is usually covered only by a thin layer of membrane skin bone meninges etc are all lacking  with very few exceptions   infants with this disorder do not survive longer than a few hours or possibly days after their birth the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds describes the presentation of this condition as follows a baby born with anencephaly is usually blind deaf unaware of its surroundings and unable to feel pain although some individuals with anencephaly may be born with a main brain stem the lack of a functioning cerebrum permanently rules out the possibility of ever gaining awareness of their surroundings reflex actions such as breathing and responses to sound or touch may occur  the cause of anencephaly is disputed folic acid has been shown to be important in neural tube formation since at least 1995 and as a subtype of neural tube defect folic acid may play a role in anencephaly studies have shown that the addition of folic acid to the diet of women of childbearing age may significantly reduce although not eliminate the incidence of neural tube defects therefore it is recommended that all women of childbearing age consume 04mg of folic acid daily  especially those attempting to conceive or who may possibly conceive as this can reduce the risk to 003  it is not advisable to wait until pregnancy has begun since by the time a woman knows she is pregnant the critical time for the formation of a neural tube defect has usually already passed a physician may prescribe even higher dosages of folic acid 4mgday for women having had a previous pregnancy with a neural tube defect  in general neural tube defects do not follow direct patterns of heredity though there is some indirect evidence of inheritance  and recent animal models indicate a possible association with deficiencies of the transcription factor tead2  studies show that a woman who has had one child with a neural tube defect such as anencephaly has about a 3 risk of having another child with a neural tube defect  as opposed to the background rate of 01 occurrence in the population at large  genetic counseling is usually offered to women at a higher risk of having a child with a neural tube defect to discuss available testing it is known that people taking certain anticonvulsants and people with insulindependent diabetes have a higher risk of having a child with a neural tube defect  anencephaly and other physical and mental deformities have also been blamed on a high exposure to such toxins as lead chromium mercury and nickel  until recently medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases that are now being found to be related as a result of new genetic research some of these are in fact highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorders anencephaly is one such disease part of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies the underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell organelles present in many cellular types throughout the human body the cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multisymptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia bardetbiedl syndrome polycystic kidney and liver disease nephronophthisis alström syndrome meckelgruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration  anencephaly can often be diagnosed before birth through an ultrasound examination the maternal serum alphafetoprotein afp screening  and detailed fetal ultrasound  can be useful for screening for neural tube defects such as spina bifida or anencephaly meronanencephaly is a rare form of anencephaly characterized by malformed cranial bones a median cranial defect and a cranial protrusion called area cerebrovasculosa area cerebrovasculosa is a section of abnormal spongy vascular tissue admixed with glial tissue ranging from simply a membrane to a large mass of connective tissue hemorrhagic vascular channels glial nodules and disorganized choroid plexuses  the most common type of anencephaly in which the brain is completely absent  the most severe type of anencephaly where area cerebrovasculosa and area medullovasculosa fill both cranial defects and the spinal column craniorachischisis is characterized by anencephaly accompanied by bony defects in the spine and the exposure of neural tissue as the vault of the skull fails to form   craniorachischisis occurs in about 1 of every 1000 live births but various physical and chemical tests can detect neural tube closure during early pregnancy  there is no cure or standard treatment for anencephaly and the prognosis for patients is death most anencephalic fetuses do not survive birth accounting for 55 of nonaborted cases if the infant is not stillborn then he or she will usually die within a few hours or days after birth from cardiorespiratory arrest   five recorded cases of anencephalic children surviving for longer periods of time are stephanie keene of falls church virginia usa who lived for 2 years 174 days vitoria de cristo born in brazil in january 2010 and surviving until july 17 2012  nickolas coke  of pueblo colorado usa who lived for 3 years and 11 months and died october 31 2012   and angela morales from providence rhode island  baby aaron who is over two years old as of october 2015   in almost all cases anencephalic infants are not aggressively resuscitated because there is no chance of the infants ever achieving a conscious existence instead the usual clinical practice is to offer hydration nutrition and comfort measures and to let nature take its course artificial ventilation surgery to fix any coexisting congenital defects and drug therapy such as antibiotics are usually regarded as futile efforts some clinicians and medical ethicists view even the provision of nutrition and hydration as medically futile  in the united states anencephaly occurs in about 1 out of every 10000 births  rates may be higher among black africans with rates in nigeria estimated at 3 per 10000 in 1990 while rates in ghana estimated at 8 per 10000 in 1992  rates in china are estimated at 5 per 10000  research has suggested that overall female babies are more likely to be affected by the disorder  one issue concerning anencephalic newborns is organ donation initial legal guidance came from the case of baby theresa in 1992 in which the boundaries of organ donation were tested for the first time  infant organs are scarce and the high demand for pediatric organ transplants poses a major public health issue in 1999 it was found that among children who die under the age of two thirty to fifty percent do so while awaiting transplant  in order for infant organs to be viable and used for transplant they must be removed while the infant still has circulation or very soon after circulation has ceased however this poses both legal and ethical issues in the united states all states have laws that forbid the removal of organs from a donor until after the donor has died except in the case of altruistic living donations of a kidney or liver segment the goal of those in support of organ donation is that it will further contribute to the pool of suitable organs for transplants while the need for lifesaving organ transplants is so great it has been estimated that 400500 infant hearts and kidneys and 5001000 infant livers are needed in the united states each year  because anencephalic neonates have partially functioning brain stems they possess some brain stem reflexes such as spontaneous respirations for this reason these patients cannot be declared brain dead within the medical community the main ethical issues with organ donation are a misdiagnosis of anencephaly the slippery slope argument that anencephalic neonates would rarely be a source of organs and that it would undermine confidence in organ transplantation  slippery slope concerns are a major issue in personhood debates across the board in regards to anencephaly those who oppose organ donation argue that it could open the door for involuntary organ donors such as an elderly person with severe dementia another point of contention is the number of children who would actually benefit there are discrepancies in statistics however it is known that most anencephalic children are stillborn  proposals have been made to bypass the legal and ethical issues surrounding organ donation these include waiting for death to occur before procuring organs expanding the definition of death creating a special legal category for anencephalic infants and defining them as nonpersons  in the united kingdom a child born with anencephaly was reported as the countrys youngest organ donor teddy houlston was diagnosed as anencephalic at 12 weeks his parents jess evans and mike houlston decided against abortion and instead proposed organ donation teddy was born on 22 april 2014 in cardiff wales and lived for 100 minutes after which his heart and kidneys were removed his kidneys were later transplanted into an adult in leeds teddys twin noah was born healthy  there are four different concepts used to determine brain death failure of heart failure of lungs whole brain death and neocortical death some argue that anencephalics experience neocortical death in which there is an irreversible loss of consciousness and selfawareness two determinants of a person brain death is another source of support for organ donation  neocortical death similar to a persistent vegetative state pvs involves loss of cognitive functioning of the brain a proposal by law professor david randolph smith  in an attempt to prove that neocortical death should legally be treated the same as brain death involved pet scans to determine the similarities however this proposal has been criticized on the basis that confirming neocortical death by pet scan may risk indeterminacy  anencephaly can be diagnosed before delivery with a high degree of accuracy although anencephaly is a fatal condition the option of abortion is dependent on the abortion laws in the state  according to a 2013 report 26 of the worlds population reside in a country where abortion is generally prohibited    in 2012 brazil extended the right of abortion to mothers with anencephalic fetuses this decision is however receiving much disapproval by several religious groups  the case of baby theresa was the beginning of the ethical debate over anencephalic infant organ donation  the story of baby theresa remains a focus of basic moral philosophy baby theresa was born with anencephaly in 1992 her parents knowing that their child was going to die requested that her organs be given for transplantation although her physicians agreed florida law prohibited the infants organs from being removed while she was still alive by the time she died nine days after birth her organs had deteriorated past the point of being viable  baby k was an anenecephalic infant that was kept alive for two years and 174 days under intensive care by order of the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit the uniform determination of death act udda is a model bill adopted by many us states stating that an individual who has sustained either 1 irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or 2 irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain including the brain stem is dead this bill was a result of much debate over the definition of death and is applicable to the debate over anencephaly a related bill the uniform anatomical gift act uaga grants individuals and after death their family members the right to decide whether or not to donate organs because it is against the law for any person to pay money for an organ the person in need of an organ transplant must rely on a volunteer  there have been two state bills that proposed to change current laws regarding death and organ donation california senate bill 2018 proposed to amend the udda to define anencephalic infants as already dead while new jersey assembly bill 3367 proposed to allow anencephalic infants to be organ sources even if they are not dead   some genetic research has been conducted to determine the causes of anencephaly it has been found that cartilage homeoprotein cart1 is selectively expressed in chondrocytes cartilage cells the cart1 gene to chromosome 12q213q22 has been mapped also it has been found that mice homozygous for deficiency in the cart1 gene manifested acrania and meroanencephaly and prenatal treatment with folic acid will suppress acrania and meroanencephaly in the cart1deficient mutants

V aflatoxin b1 is an aflatoxin produced by aspergillus flavus and a parasiticus it is arguably the most potent carcinogen known and is up to twice as carcinogenic as an equitoxic dose of xrays aflatoxin b1 is a common contaminant in a variety of foods including peanuts cottonseed meal corn and other grains  as well as animal feeds  aflatoxin b1 is considered the most toxic aflatoxin and it is highly implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma hcc in humans  in animals aflatoxin b1 has also been shown to be mutagenic  teratogenic  and to cause immunosuppression  several sampling and analytical methods including thinlayer chromatography tlc highperformance liquid chromatography hplc mass spectroscopy and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa among others have been used to test for aflatoxin b1 contamination in foods  according to the food and agriculture organization fao the worldwide maximum tolerated levels of aflatoxin b1 was reported to be in the range of 120 µgkg in food and 550 µgkg in dietary cattle feed in 2003    aflatoxin b1 is mostly found in contaminated food and humans are exposed to aflatoxin b1 almost entirely through their diet  occupational exposure to aflatoxin b1 has also been reported in swine  and poultry production  aflatoxin b1 can permeate through the skin dermal exposure to this aflatoxin in particular environmental conditions can lead to major health risks  the liver is the most susceptible organ to aflatoxin b1 toxicity in animal studies pathological lesions associated with aflatoxin b1 intoxication include reduction in weight of liver  vacuolation of hepatocytes  and hepatic carcinoma  other liver lesions include enlargement of hepatic cells fatty infiltration necrosis hemorrhage fibrosis regeneration of nodules and bile duct proliferationhyperplasia  aflatoxin b1 is derived from both a dedicated fatty acid synthase fas and a polyketide synthase pks together known as norsolorinic acid synthase the biosynthesis begins with the synthesis of hexanoate by the fas which then becomes the starter unit for the iterative type i pks    the pks adds seven malonylcoa extenders to the hexanoate to form the c20 polyketide compound the pks folds the polyketide in a particular way to induce cyclization to form the anthraquinone norsolorinic acid a reductase then catalyzes the reduction of the ketone on the norsolorinic acid sidechain to yield averantin    averantin is converted to averufin via a two different enzymes a hydroxylase and an alcohol dehydrogenase this will oxygenate and cyclize averantins side chain to form the ketal in averufin from this point on the biosynthetic pathway of aflatoxin b1 becomes much more complicated with several major skeletal changes most of the enzymes have not been characterized and there may be several more intermediates that are still unknown  however what is known is that averufin is oxidized by a p450oxidase avfa in a baeyervilliger oxidation this opens the ether rings and upon rearrangement versiconal acetate is formed now an esterase esta catalyzes the hydrolysis of the acetyl forming the primary alcohol in versiconal   the acetal in versicolorin a is formed from the cyclization of the sidechain in versiconal which is catalyzed by verb synthase and then verb a desaturase reduces versicolorin b to form the dihydrobisfuran   there are two more enzymes that catalyze the conversion of versicolorin a to demethylsterigmatocystin afln an oxidase and aflm a reductase these enzymes utilize both molecular oxygen and two nadphs to dehydrate one of the hydroxyl groups on the anthraquinone and open the quinine with the molecular oxygen   upon forming the aldehyde in the ring opening step it is oxidized to form the carboxylic acid and subsequently a decarboxylation event occurs to close the ring forming the sixmember ether ring system seen in demethylsterigmatocystin the next two steps in the biosynthetic pathway is the methylation by sadenosyl methionine sam of the two hydroxyl groups on the xanthone part of demethysterigmatocystin by two different methyltransferases omtb and omta   this yields omethylsterigmatocystin in the final steps there is an oxidative cleavage of the aromatic ring and loss of one carbon in omethylsterigmatocystin which is catalyzed by orda an oxidoreductase   then a final recyclization occurs to form aflatoxin b1 several aflatoxin b1 toxicity studies have been conducted on various animal species  aflatoxin b1 exposure is best managed by measures aimed at preventing contamination of crops in the field postharvest handling and storage or via measures aimed at detecting and decontaminating contaminated commodities or materials used in animal feed for instance biological decontamination involving the use of a single bacterial species flavobacterium aurantiacum has been used to remove aflatoxin b1 from peanuts and corn  several countries around the world have rules and regulations governing aflatoxin b1 in foods and these include the maximum permitted or recommended levels of aflatoxin b1 for certain foods

V caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis or hypoplasia of the sacrum is a congenital disorder in which there is abnormal fetal development of the lower spinethe caudal partition of the spine  it occurs at a rate of approximately one per 25000 live births   this condition exists in a variety of forms ranging from partial absence of the tail bone regions of the spine to absence of the lower vertebrae pelvis and parts of the thoracic andor lumbar areas of the spine in some cases where only a small part of the spine is absent there may be no outward sign of the condition in cases where more substantial areas of the spine are absent there may be fused webbed or smaller lower extremities and paralysis bowel and bladder control is usually affected there are four levels or types of malformation the least severe indicates partial deformation unilateral of the sacrum the second level indicates a bilateral uniform deformation the most severe types involve a total absence of the sacrum depending on the type of sacral agenesis bowel or urinary bladder deficiencies may be present a permanent colostomy may be necessary in the case of imperforate anus incontinence may also require some type of continence control system eg selfcatheterization be utilized occasionally if deformities of the knees legs or feet would prove unresponsive to corrective action amputation at the knee may be proposed before more comprehensive medical treatment was available full amputation of the legs at the hip was often performed more recently the amputation actually a disarticulation because no cutting of the bone is involved is done at the knee for those who have bent knee positions and webbing between thigh and calf to enable more ease of mobility and better seating some children with knee disarticulation use prosthetic legs to walk prosthetics for children without substantial hip and trunk control is usually abandoned in favor of faster and easier wheelchair mobility as the childs weight and age increases children may walk on their hands and generally are able to climb and move about to accomplish whatever they need and want to accomplish children more mildly affected may have normal gait and no need for assistive devices for walking others may walk with bracing or crutches there is typically no cognitive impairment associated with this disability adults with this disability live independently attend college and have careers in various fields in 2012 spencer west a man with sacral agenesis and both legs amputated climbed mt kilimanjaro using only his hands  the condition arises from some factor or set of factors present during approximately the 3rd week to 7th week of fetal development formation of the sacrumlower back and corresponding nervous system is usually nearing completion by the 4th week of development due to abnormal gastrulation the mesoderm migration is disturbed this disturbance results in symptoms varying from minor lesions of the lower vertebrae to more severe symptoms such as complete fusion of the lower limbs while the exact etiology is unknown it has been speculated that the condition may be associated with certain dietary deficiencies including a lack or insufficient amounts of folic acid sacral agenesis syndrome agenesis of the lumbar spine sacrum and coccyx and hypoplasia of the lower extremities is a wellestablished congenital anomaly associated with maternal diabetes mellitus not gestational diabetes however other etiologic factors are presumably involved as demonstrated by the rare incidence of caudal regression syndrome 160000 compared to diabetes certainly not all children born with caudal regression syndrome have diabetic mothers the dominant inherited sacral agenesis also referred to as currarino syndrome is very often correlated with a mutation in the hb9 also called hlxb9 gene shown by sally ann lynch 1995 nature genetics it may be the cause of sirenomelia mermaid syndrome synonyms for crs

V hajducheney syndrome also called acroosteolysis with osteoporosis and changes in skull and mandible arthrodentoosteodysplasia and cheney syndrome  is an extremely rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder   of the connective tissue characterized by severe and excessive bone resorption leading to osteoporosis and a wide range of other possible symptoms mutations in the notch2 gene identified in 2011 cause hcs hcs is so rare that only about 70 cases have been reported worldwide since the discovery of the syndrome in 1948   hajducheney syndrome causes many issues with an individuals connective tissues some general characteristics of an individual with hajducheney syndrome include bone flexibility and deformities short stature delayed acquisition of speech and motor skills dolichocephalic skull wormian bone small maxilla hypoplastic frontal sinuses basilar impression joint laxity bulbous finger tips and severe osteoporosis wormian bone occurs when extra bones appear between cranial sutures fetuses with hajducheney syndrome often will not be seen to unclench their hands on obstetrical ultrasound they may also have lowset ears and their eyes may be farther apart than on a usual child called hypertelorism childrens heads can have some deformities in their shape and size plagiocephaly early tooth loss and bone deformities such as serpentine tibiae and fibulae are also common in those affected the mechanism thought to cause hcs is an abnormality in osteoblast and osteoid function these are major components of bone development and the low function of each leads to the weak bones that characterize hcs hajducheney syndrome is a monogenic disorder the disorder is inherited and controlled by a single pair of genes a single copy of the mutant gene on an autosome causes hcs hcs is an autosomal dominant disorder only one parent with the defective gene is needed to pass the disorder to the offspring mutations within the last coding exon of notch2 that remove the pest domain and escape the nonsensemediated mrna decay have been shown to be the main cause of hajducheney syndrome    the notch2 gene plays a very important role in skeletogenesis mutations of notch2 that seem to cause hcs occur in the last coding exon of the gene exon 34 these mutations remove pest domains which mediate proteosomal destruction of the protein these pest domains are removed due to the premature stop codon in the amino acid sequence all hcs alleles are observed to have premature protein destruction before the pest sequence is fully translated the result is a mature notch2 gene with a partially completed pest sequence in some cases no pest sequence at all is seen this leads to the no proteosomal destruction of the protein the notch2 gene is ubiquitously expressed in all embryonic tissue when researching hcs in mice the homozygous deletion of notch2 leads to death this observation is important because it explains how the hcs phenotype is not isolated to only one system of the body notch2 is also shown to regulate rankl osteoclastogenesis which is the production of functional osteoclasts osteoclasts are the component that breaks bone down this is why bone loss is observed in hcs patients due to the overactivation of rankl one of the main methods of pinpointing a notch2 mutation that leads to hcs is through whole genome sequencing this is then followed by exome capture by means of insolution hybridization the exome part of the genome consists of exons parallel sequencing follows the hybridization which results in about 35 gb of sequence data these sequence data are then analyzed through sequence analysis and symptom presentation in hcs patients this proves to be the most definitive method of diagnosis laboratory testing reveals multiple mutations of hcs two genetic variants result in sporadic hcs symptoms which are hcs02 and hcs03 these mutations produce symptoms that come and go but have been present de novo hcs03 was identified as the variant that is passed through afflicted family members and presents symptoms throughout the lifetime of the individual all variants of hcs lead to the same premature termination of pest sequences which compromise normal function of notch2 notch has four different receptors which have an affinity for similar ligands they are classified as singlepass transmembrane receptors since about 2002 some patients with this disorder have been offered drug therapy with bisphosphonates a class of osteoporosis drugs to treat problems with bone resorption associated with the bone breakdown and skeletal malformations that characterize this disorder brand names include actonel risedronatealendronate made by merck pharmaceuticals other drugs include pamidronate made by novartis and strontium ranelate made by eli lilly however for more progressive cases surgery and bone grafting are necessary it is named after nicholas hajdu 19081987 a hungarianenglish radiologist working in the uk and william d cheney md 18991985 a us radiologist

V megalencephaly or macrencephaly abbreviated meg is a growth development disorder in which the brain is abnormally large it is characterized by a brain with an average weight that is 25 standard deviations from the mean of the general population  megalencephaly is usually diagnosed at birth and is confirmed with an mri a mutation in the pi3kakt pathway is believed to be the primary cause of brain proliferation and ultimately the root cause of megalencephaly this mutation has produced a classification of brain overdevelopment that consists of two syndromes including megalencephalycapillary malformation mcap and megalencephalypolydactylypolymicrogyriahydrocephalus mpph  approximately 1 out of 50 children 2 are said to have the characteristics of megalencephaly in the general population  there are several neuropsychiatric disorders linked with megalencephaly however studies have shown that autism is the most prevalent association with the malformation of meg  although no treatment currently exists for megalencephaly management methods are focused at reducing deficits linked with autism most recent research is targeted at creating inhibitors to reduce the mutational pathway that causes megalencephaly    it is believed that megalencephaly was discovered in 1972 prior to diagnoses that used mri scanning as a way to confirm brain overgrowth cases of megalencephaly were diagnosed by autopsy in which the physical brain was measured and weighed  macrocephaly is a term used to define a person who has an abnormally large head the circumference of the head must be above the 95th percentile or at least 25 standard deviations from the mean of normal weight and gender groups in the united states   a person with macrocephaly does not necessarily indicate that megalencephaly is also present large skulls usually exhibit no neurodevelopment conditions at all meaning most individuals with macrocephaly are healthy hemimegalencephaly is an extremely rare form of macrocephaly and is characterized by uneven development of brain hemispheres onehalf of brain is larger than other  the syndrome can be presented by itself or in association with phakomatosis or hemigigantism additionally hemimegalencephaly will frequently cause severe epilepsy focal neurological deficits macrocrania and mild to severe mental retardation  megalencephalycapillary mcap is one of the two major syndromes of megalencephaly typically mcap and mpph can be distinguished by somatic features  mcap includes many characteristics that are observed at birth including cutaneous vascular malformations especially capillary malformations of the face and cutis marmorata polydactyly connective tissue dysplasia and focal or segmental body overgrowth  furthermore mcap can occasionally be linked with asymmetric brain overgrowth hemimegalencephaly as well as segmental overgrowth of the body hemihypertrophy  megalencephalypolymicrogyriapolydactylyhydrocephalus mpph is one of the two major syndromes contributing to megalencephaly typically mcap and mpph can be distinguished by somatic features  in differentiation to mcap mpph lacks consistent somatic features other than postaxial polydactly  furthermore brain and body development is normally symmetric in the majority of patients that appear to have mpph symptoms  although very little is still known as to the direct cause of megalencephaly recent studies have begun to provide early indications of possible sources for its formation recent research has shown that there is a strong link between genetic pathways that cause brain develop and mutations in that pathway that result in brain overgrowth recent studies have shown that mutations in phosphoinositide 3kinase pi3k and akt also known as protein kinase b pathway have been identified in mcap and mpph this pathway has proven to be an integral part of brain growth and development and is an area of interest to many researchers who study the cause of megalencephaly mutations in this pathway have been shown to cause a gain of function in the activation of the pi3kakt pathway  this cellular pathway is critical in the regulation of diverse cell functions including cell growth proliferation metabolism survival apoptosis angiogenesis tumorigenesis and most importantly in regards to megalencephaly brain development  akt is a crucial signaling molecule part of the pi3k pathway and is also involved in many cellular functions these functions include brain development synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment loss of function in akt can cause microcephaly in humans while inactivation of the pathway can cause hemimegalencephaly  there are also several cancers that have been shown to be linked with mutations in the akt pathway including melanoma and lung cancer    puralpha pur\u03b1 is a sequencespecific singlestranded dna and rnabinding protein studies have shown that the protein is primarily active during early development and is believed to have a role in brain enlargement  although the exact function is still controversial it is believed that puralpha is responsible for neuronal proliferation during neurogenesis as well as the maturation of dendrites  thus puralpha is also considered a potential root cause of megalencephaly and brain overgrowth one impact of megalencephaly is the complete lack of motor development one medical study assessed three patients presenting megalencephaly who showed severely impaired motor and speech development as well as distinct facial abnormalities including skull bossing a low nasal bridge and large eyes  diagnosis of megalencephaly has changed over the years however with the development of more advanced equipment physicians have been able to confirm the disorder with better accuracy usually a physical exam is first performed when characteristics of megalencephaly have appeared this typically occurs at birth or during early child development a physician will then take head measurements in order to determine the circumference this is known as the head circumference  then a family background will be recorded in order to determine if there has been a history of megalencephaly in the family  a neurological exam will then be performed using the technology of an mri machine in order to confirm the diagnosis of megalencephaly these imaging tests give detailed information regarding brain size volume asymmetry and other irregular developments linked with mcap mpph and hemimegalencephaly   there is also a strong correlation of epilepsy and megalencephaly and this can aid doctors in their diagnosis  if a diagnosis of megalencephaly is confirmed the child is referred to a specialist who focuses on managing the symptoms and improving lifestyle since megalencephaly is usually presented with autism the goal of treatment is to improve deficiencies associated with autistic causes additionally since each patient has unique symptoms there is no one specific treatment method and therefore is heavily reliant on symptoms associated with an individual there is currently no specific treatment for megalencephaly however periodic head measurements may be assessed to determine the rate of brain growth those individuals who develop neurological disorders may be prescribed antiepileptic drugs for seizures  studies have shown that reducing epilepsy can increase cell apoptosis and reduce the proliferation of neurons that ultimately leads to brain overgrowth  since there are very few treatment methods focused on managing megalencephaly future research is targeted at inhibiting mutation of the pathway however this next step could be met with several complications as understanding the underlying mechanism of the mutation is a difficult task the genetic coding that initiates a single mutation is sporadic and patterns are hard to detect in many cases  even thought very little research has been done to create inhibitors of the pi3kakt pathway several pharmaceutical companies have begun to focus their interests in designing a prevention method for this purpose  the prognosis of megalencephaly depends heavily on the underlying cause and assosciated neurological disorders  because the majority of megalencephaly cases are linked with autism the prognosis is equivalent to the corresponding condition since hemimegalencephaly is associated with severe seizures hemiparesis and mental retardation the result is a poor prognosis in most cases those diagnosed with this type of megalencephaly usually do not survive through adulthood  future research is targeted at further understanding mutations and how they lead to mcap and mpph sydnromes the majority of studies of megalencephaly have included mice who present brain abnormalities and overgrowth the next step is to move to clinical trials involving humans in order to determine the exact genetic mutation causing the sequences additionally scientists and pharmaceutical companies have begun to show interest in mutation inhibition and designing preventative methods to eliminate the underlying cause of megalencephaly altogether  approximately one out of every 50 2 children in the general population are said to have megalencephaly  additionally it is said that megalencephaly affects 34 times more men than females those individuals that are classified with macrocephaly or general head overgrowth are said to have megalencephaly at a rate of 1030 of the time there is an extremely high association between megalencephaly and autism approximately 20 of autistic children have megalencephaly making it the most common physical characteristic of autism  patients that present both megalencephaly and autistic characteristics usually also show signs of hyperactivity as a major symptom however there is no definitive evidence that autism is the primary causeresult of megalencephaly this is because megalencephaly has also been described in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia or alzheimers  since most children with megalencephaly also have autism the goal of treatment for meg is focused on managing the signs and symptoms associated with autism

V first described by columbi in 1559  triphalangeal thumb tpt is a congenital malformation where the thumb has three phalanges instead of two the extra phalangeal bone can vary in size from that of a small pebble to a size comparable to the phalanges in nonthumb digits the true incidence of the condition is unknown but is estimated at 125000 live births  in about twothirds of the patients with triphalangeal thumbs there is a hereditary component  besides the three phalanges there can also be other malformations   the triphalangeal thumb has a different appearance than normal thumbs the appearance can differ widely the thumb can be a longer thumb it can be deviated in the radioulnar plane clinodactyly thumb strength can be diminished in the case of a five fingeredhand it has a fingerlike appearance with the position in the plane of the four fingers thenar muscle deficiency and additional length there is often a combination with radial polydactyly generally triphalangeal thumbs are nonopposable in contrast to most people with opposable thumbs a person suffering from tpt cannot easily place his or her thumb opposite the other four digits of the same hand the opposable thumbs ability to effortlessly utilize fingers in a pinch formation is critical in precision gripping for the thumb to adequately grip certain thumb criteria must be met eg suitable position and length stable joints and good thenar muscle strength  because triphalangeal thumbs cannot easily oppose and do not possess many of the optimal qualities found in most opposable thumbs they tend to cause the hand to be less effective in use and therefore prove to be more problematic in daily life malformations of the upper extremities can occur in the third to seventh embryonic week  in some cases the tpt is hereditary in these cases there is a mutation on chromosome 7q36  if the tpt is hereditary it is mostly inherited as an autosomal dominant trait  nonopposable and bilateral  the sporadic cases are mostly opposable and unilateral  triphalangeal thumb can occur in syndromes but it can also be isolated the triphalangeal thumb can appear in combination with other malformations or syndromes  syndromes include malformations include  there are multiple classifications for the triphalangeal thumb the reason for these different classifications is the heterogeneity in appearance of the tpt the classification according to wood   describes the shape of the extra phalanx delta fig 4 rectangular or full phalanx table 1 with the classification made by buckgramcko a surgical treatment can be chosen table 1 buckgramcko differentiates between six different shapes of the extra phalanx and associated malformations  table 1 classifications of wood   and buckgramcko   the goals of surgical treatment are reducing length of the thumb creating a good functioning a stable and non deviated joint and improving the position of the thumb if necessary hereby improving function of the hand and thumb in general the surgical treatment is done for improvement of the thumb function however an extra advantage of the surgery is the improvement in appearance of the thumb in the past surgical treatment of the triphalangeal thumb was not indicated  but now it is generally agreed that operative treatment improves function and appearance because an operation was not indicated in the past theres still a population with an untreated triphalangeal thumb the majority of this population doesnt want surgery because the daily functioning of the hand is good  the main obstacle for the untreated patients might not be the diminished function but the appearance of the triphalangeal thumb  the timing of surgery differs between wood and buckgramcko wood advises operation between the age of six months and two years  while buckgramcko advises to operate for all indications before the age of six years

V a schatzki ring or schatzkigary ring is a narrowing of the lower esophagus that can cause difficulty swallowing dysphagia the narrowing is caused by a ring of mucosal tissue which lines the esophagus or muscular tissue  a schatzki ring is a specific type of esophageal ring and schatzki rings are further subdivided into those above the esophagusstomach junction a rings  and those found at the squamocolumnar junction in the lower esophagus b rings  patients with schatzki rings can develop intermittent difficulty swallowing or more seriously a completely blocked esophagus the ring is named after the germanamerican physician richard schatzki   not all patients with schatzki rings have symptoms barium swallow tests of the esophagus sometimes show schatzki rings in patients with no swallowing difficulties when schatzki rings cause symptoms they usually result in episodic dysphagia with solid foods or a sensation that the food sticks while swallowing especially if the food is not chewed thoroughly patients usually are able to regurgitate or force through the food material and resume eating however complete obstruction of the esophagus by a bolus of food often called steakhouse syndrome can occur this can cause crushing chest pain and may need immediate treatment with endoscopy which is the use of a specialized fibreoptic camera in order to remove the lodged food  after the obstruction is located snares or forceps are inserted to pull the food out of the esophagus or to push it into the stomach the latter is done with caution usually when the anatomy of the structures around the obstruction is already known a schatzki ring is usually diagnosed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy or barium swallow endoscopy usually shows a ring within the lumen of the esophagus which can be of variable size see picture the ring is usually located a few centimetres above the gastroesophageal junction where the esophagus joins the stomach schatzki rings can often resemble a related entity called an esophageal web esophageal webs also contain extra mucosal tissue but do not completely encircle the esophagus endoscopies and barium swallows done for other reasons often reveal unsuspected schatzki rings  meaning that many schatzki rings are asymptomatic two varieties of schatzki rings have been described the original description by schatzki and gary was of a ring of fibrous tissue seen on autopsy this is the less common type of schatzki ring  more commonly the ring consists of the same mucosal tissue that lines the entire esophagus although many hypotheses have offered the cause of schatzki rings remains uncertain both congenital and acquired factors may be involved asymptomatic schatzki rings seldom worsen over time and need no treatment symptomatic schatzki rings may be treated with esophageal dilatation using bougie or balloon dilators these have been found to be equally effective  bougie dilatation involves passage of long dilating tubes of increasing size down the esophagus to stretch the area of narrowing either over a guidewire passed into the stomach by endoscopy the savarygillard system or using mercuryweighted dilators the maloney system this is usually done with intravenous sedation to reduce discomfort dilatation can produce some temporary irritation a short course of proton pump inhibitor therapy may decrease aggravation by stomach acid reflux into the esophagus the duration of the benefit of dilation varies but may be from months to years dilation may be repeated if narrowing recurs about 6 to 14 percent of patients who receive a routine barium swallow test of the esophagus are found to have a schatzki ring

V malpuech facial clefting syndrome also called malpuech syndrome or gypsy type facial clefting syndrome  is a rare congenital syndrome it is characterized by facial clefting any type of cleft in the bones and tissues of the face including a cleft lip and palate a caudal appendage a human tail   growth deficiency intellectual and developmental disability and abnormalities of the renal system kidneys and the male genitalia  abnormalities of the heart and other skeletal malformations may also be present  the syndrome was initially described by guilliaume malpuech and associates in 1983  it is thought to be genetically related to juberghayward syndrome malpuech syndrome has also been considered as part of a spectrum of congenital genetic disorders associated with similar facial urogenital and skeletal anomalies termed 3mc syndrome this proposed spectrum includes malpuech michels and mingarellicarnevale osa syndromes   mutations in the collec11 and masp1 genes are believed to be a cause of these syndromes  the incidence of malpuech syndrome is unknown the pattern of inheritance is autosomal recessive which means a defective mutated gene associated with the syndrome is located on an autosome and the syndrome occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited    malpuech syndrome is congenital being apparent at birth it is characterized by a feature known as facial clefting observed and noted in the initial description of the syndrome as a cleft lip and palate  facial clefting is identified by clefts in the bones muscles and tissues of the face including the lips and palate the forms of cleft lip and palate typically seen with malpuech syndrome are midline down the middle of the lip and palate  or bilateral affecting both sides of the mouth and palate  facial clefting generally encompasses a wide range of severity ranging from minor anomalies such as a bifid split uvula to a cleft lip and palate to major developmental and structural defects of the facial bones and soft tissues  clefting of the lip and palate occurs during embryogenesis   additional facial and orthodental anomalies that have been described with the syndrome include hypertelorism unusually wideset eyes sometimes reported as telecanthus narrow palpebral fissures the separation between the upper and lower eyelids and ptosis drooping of the eyelids frontal bossing prominent eyebrow ridge with synophris highly arched eyebrows wide nasal root and a flattened nasal tip malar hypoplasia underdeveloped upper cheek bone micrognathia an undersized lower jaw and prominent incisors auditory anomalies include an enlarged ear ridge and hearing impairment associated with congenital otitis media or glue ear inflammation of the middle ear and sensorineural hearing loss    another feature identified with malpuech syndrome is a caudal appendage   a caudal appendage is a congenital outgrowth stemming from the coccyx tailbone present in many nonhuman animal species as a typical tail this feature when seen in an infant has been described as a human tail   this was observed by guionalmeida 1995 in three individuals from brazil the appendage on xrays variously appeared as a prominent protrusion of the coccyx  on a physical examination the appendage resembles a nodulelike stub of an animal tail  deficiencies such as mental retardation learning disability growth retardation and developmental delay are common psychiatric manifestations that have been reported with the syndrome include psychotic behavior obsessivecompulsive disorder loss of inhibition hyperactivity aggression fear of physical contact and compulsive actions like echolalia repeating the words spoken by another person neuromuscular tics have also been noted   urogenital abnormalities or those affecting the urinary and reproductive systems are common with the syndrome malpuech et al 1983 and kerstjensfrederikse et al 2005 reported variously in affected males a micropenis hypospadias a congenital mislocation of the urinary meatus cryptorchidism ectopic or undescended testes bifid split and underdeveloped scrotum and an obstructive urethral valve   an affected boy was also reported by reardon et al 2001 with left renal agenesis an enlarged and downwardly displaced right kidney cryptorchidism and a shawl scrotum  other malformations that have been noted with the syndrome are omphalocele  and an umbilical hernia  congenital abnormalities of the heart have also been observed with malpuech syndrome from a healthy japanese couple chinen and naritomi 1995 described the sixth child who had features consistent with the disorder this twomonthold male infant was also affected by cardiac anomalies including patent ductus arteriosus pda  and ventricular septal defect  the opening in the ductus arteriosus associated with pda had been surgically repaired in the infant at 38 days of age a number of minor skeletal aberrations were also reported in the infant including wormian bones at the lambdoid sutures  malpuech syndrome has been shown to have physical or phenotypical similarities with several other genetic disorders a report by reardon et al 2001 of a nineyearold boy exhibiting facial caudal and urogenital anomalies consistent with malpuech syndrome who also had skeletal malformites indicative of juberghayward syndrome suggests that the two disorders may be allelic caused by different mutations of the same gene  along with several other disorders that have similar or overlapping features and autosomal recessive inheritance malpuech syndrome has been considered to belong under the designation 3mc syndrome titomanlio et al 2005 described a threeyearold female known to have michels syndrome in their review of the physical similarities between michels malpuech and mingarellicarnevale syndromesparticularly the facial appearance including instances of cleft lip and palate and ptosis and a similarity of congenital abdominal and urogenital anomaliesthey believed the syndromes may represent a spectrum of genetic disorders rather than three individual disorders they initially suggested this spectrum could be named 3mc michelsmalpuechmingarellicarnevale syndrome  this conclusion and the name 3mc syndrome was supported by leal et al 2008 who reported a brother and sister with an array of symptoms that overlapped the various syndromes  further assertion of 3mc syndrome was by rooryck et al 2011 in an elaboration of its cause  malpuech syndrome as with the other disorders within the 3mc syndrome consideration is caused by mutations in the collec11 and masp1 genes in an investigation by rooryck et al 2011 eleven families affected by 3mc syndrome were studied which resulted in the identification of these two mutations both genes encode proteins of the lectin complement pathway which plays a role in the complement system of innate or nonspecific immunity in humans and other species  the collec11 or clk1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 2p253 in humans  the clk1 protein is a ctype lectin and belongs to the collectin family of these proteins other than its role in innate immunity the protein is thought to be involved in the development of tissues including craniofacial cartilage the heart and kidney during embryogenesis this function in facial development was corroborated through study of the zebrafish where mutations in its version of clk1 contributed to craniofacial abnormalities possibly associated with errors in neural crest cell migration  the masp1 or mannanbinding serine protease i gene is located on the long arm of human chromosome 3 at 3q27q28  the protein is a type of connectin called a mannanbinding lectin which plays a role in innate immunity by binding to pathogens such as viruses including hiv  as described by sirmaci et al 2010 three turkish individuals from two consanguineous families the children of relatives such as cousins are said to be in a consanguineous family with various characteristics of 3mc syndrome including facial dysmorphism and a caudal appendage were evaluated investigation of homologous chromosomes through gene mapping revealed an autozygous region a location on a chromosome where both alleles of a gene originate from a common ancestor at chromosome 3q27 in both families in one family a missense mutation in masp1 at this location resulted in the replacement of the amino acid glycine by arginine at position 687 in the gene sequence the mutation cosegregated with the observed phenotype in individuals from the second family dna sequencing of masp1 showed a nonsense mutation that resulted in a deactivation of tryptophan at position 290 in the gene that also cosegregated with the phenotype both mutations occur in a form of masp1 known to process igfbp5 loss of this function associated with mutation of masp1 causes disruptions in the availability of insulinlike growth factor during craniofacial and musculoskeletal development during the embryonic period these results indicate that mutations in masp1 are responsible for an array of features found with malformation disorders including malpuech syndrome  the syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner  this means the defective genes responsible for the disorder collec11 masp1 is located on an autosome chromosomes 2 and 3 are autosomes and two copies of the defective gene one inherited from each parent are required in order to be born with the disorder the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder it is suggested that the diagnostic criteria for malpuech syndrome should include cleft lip andor palate typical associated facial features and at least two of the following urogenital anomalies caudal appendage and growth or developmental delay  due to the relatively high rate of hearing impairment found with the disorder it too may be considered in the diagnosis another congenital disorder wolfhirschhorn pittrogersdanks syndrome shares malpuech features in its diagnostic criteria because of this lacking differentiation karyotyping microscopic analysis of the chromosomes of an individual can be employed to distinguish the two whereas deletions in the short arm of chromosome 4 would be revealed with wolfhirschhorn a karyotype without this aberration present would favor a malpuech syndrome diagnosis also the karyotype of an individual with malpuech syndrome alone will be normal  many of the congenital malformations found with malpuech syndrome can be corrected surgically these include cleft lip and palate omphalocele urogenital and craniofacial abnormalities skeletal deformities such as a caudal appendage or scoliosis and hernias of the umbillicus the primary area of concern for these procedures applied to a neonate with congenital disorders including malpuech syndrome regards the logistics of anesthesia methods like tracheal intubation for management of the airway during general anesthesia can be hampered by the even smaller or maldeveloped mouth of the infant for regional anesthesia methods like spinal blocking are more difficult where scoliosis is present in a 2010 report by kiernan et al a fouryearold girl with malpuech syndrome was being prepared for an unrelated tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy while undergoing intubation insertion of a laryngoscope needed to identify the airway for the placement of the endotracheal tube was made troublesome by the presence of micrognathia attributed to the syndrome after replacement with a laryngoscope of adjusted size intubation proceeded normally successful general anesthesia followed  a rare followup of a male with malpuech syndrome was presented by priolo et al 2007 born at term from an uneventful pregnancy and delivery the infant underwent a surgical repair of a cleft lip and palate no problems were reported with the procedure a heart abnormality atrial septal defect was also apparent but required no intervention at age three years mental retardation hyperactivity and obsessive compulsive disorder were diagnosed hearing impairment was diagnosed at age six managed with the use of hearing aids over the course of the decade that followed a number of psychiatric evaluations were performed at age 14 he exhibited a fear of physical contact at age 15 he experienced a severe psychotic episode characterized by agitation and a loss of sociosexual inhibition this array of symptoms were treated pharmocologically with prescription medications he maintained a low level of mental deficiency by age 17 with moments of compulsive echolalia  the incidence of malpuech syndrome has not been determined  a 1999 report by crisponi et al suggested that only about 12 individuals worldwide were affected by the disorder at that time  the syndrome was first reported by guilliaume malpuech and colleagues in 1983 observed in four children of unspecified gender in what was described as a gypsy family the children included three siblings and their first cousin the family was known to be highly consanguineous

V pierre robin syndrome abbreviated to prs and also known as pierre robin malformation pierre robin anomaly or pierre robin anomalad is a congenital condition of facial abnormalities in humans prs is a sequence ie a chain of certain developmental malformations one entailing the next the three main features are cleft palate retrognathia abnormal positioning of the jaw or maxilla and glossoptosis airway obstruction caused by backwards displacement of the tongue base a genetic cause to prs was recently identified pierre robin sequence may be caused by genetic anomalies at chromosomes 2  11  or 17    prs is characterized by an unusually small mandible micrognathia  posterior displacement or retraction of the tongue glossoptosis and upper airway obstruction incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth cleft palate is present in the majority of patients and is commonly ushaped it is not known how this abnormality occurs in infants  but one theory is that at some time during the stage of the formation of the bones of the fetus the tip of the jaw mandible becomes stuck in the point where each of the collar bones clavicle meet the sternum effectively preventing the jaw bones from growing it is thought that at about 12 to 14 weeks gestation when the fetus begins to move the movement of the head causes the jaw to pop out of the collar bones from this time on the jaw of the fetus grows as it would normally with the result that when born the jaw of the baby is much smaller micrognathia than it would have been with normal development although it does continue to grow at a normal rate until the child reaches maturity however association with gene loci 2q241333 4q32qter 11q21231 and 17q21243 has been found  recent studies have indicated that genetic dysregulation of sox9 gene prevents the sox9 protein from properly controlling the development of facial structures which leads to isolated prs  similarly kcnj2 gene also has a role to play  overlap with certain other genetic syndromes like patau syndrome has also been found  prs may occur in isolation but it is often part of an underlying disorder or syndrome  the most common is stickler syndrome other disorders causing prs according to dr robert j sphrintzen phd of the center for craniofacial disorders montefiore medical center are velocardiofacial syndrome fetal alcohol syndrome and treacher collins syndrome for more disorders associated with prs see dr sphrintzens article entitled the implications of the diagnosis of robin sequence the syndrome is generally diagnosed clinically shortly after birth the infant usually has respiratory difficulty especially when supine the cleft palate is often ushaped and wider than in cleft palate that is not associated with this syndrome the goals of treatment in infants with robin sequence focus upon breathing and feeding and optimizing growth and nutrition despite the predisposition for breathing difficulties if there is evidence of airway obstruction snorty breathing apnea difficulty taking a breath or drops in oxygen then the infant should be placed in the sidelying or prone position which helps bring the tongue base forward in many children one study of 60 infants with prs found that 63 of infants responded to prone positioning smith and senders 2006 int j pediatr oto 53 of the infants in this study required some form of feeding assistance either nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube feedings feeding directly into the stomach in a separate study of 115 children with the clinical diagnosis of prs managed at 2 different hospitals in boston evans et al 2006 in j pediatr oto respiratory distress was managed successfully in 56 without an operation either by prone positioning short term intubation or placement of a nasopharyngeal airway in this study gastrostomy tube feeding were placed in 42 of these infants due to feeding difficulties gastroesophageal reflux ger seems to be more prevalent in children with robin sequence dudkiewicz march 2000 cpcj because reflux of acidic contents in the posterior pharynx and upper airway can intensify the symptoms of robin sequence specifically by worsening airway obstruction it is important to maximize treatment for ger in children with prs and reflux symptoms treatment may include upright positioning on a wedge a tucker sling may be needed if the baby is in the prone position small and frequent feedings to minimize vomiting andor pharmacotherapy such as proton pump inhibitors in nasopharyngeal cannulation or placement of the nasopharyngeal airway or tube the infant is fitted with a blunttipped length of surgical tubing or an endotracheal tube fitted to the child which is placed under direct visualization with a laryngoscope being inserted into the nose and down the pharynx or throat ending just above the vocal cords surgical threads fitted through holes in the outside end of the tube are attached to the cheek with a special skinlike adhesive material called stomahesive which is also wrapped around the outside end of the tube but not over the opening at the end to keep the tube in place this tube or cannula which itself acts as an airway primarily acts as a sort of splint which maintains patency of the airway by keeping the tongue form falling back on the posterior pharyngeal wall and occluding the airway therefore preventing airway obstruction hypoxia and asphyxia nasopharyngeal airways are not available at every center however when available nasopharyngeal cannulation should be favored over the other treatments mentioned in this article as it is far less invasive it allows the infant to feed without the further placement of a nasogastric tube this treatment may be utilized for multiple months until the jaw has grown enough so that the tongue assumes a more normal position in the mouth and airway at birth the jaws of some infants are so underdeveloped that only the tip of the tongue can be seen when viewed in the throat some institutions discharge the infant home with a nasopharyngeal tube in place citation kd anderson may 2007 cpcj distraction osteogenesis do also called a mandibular distraction can be used to correct abnormal smallness of one or both jaws seen in patients with robin sequence enlargement of the lower jaw brings the tongue forward preventing it from obstructing the upper airway the process of do begins with preoperative assessment doctors use threedimensional imaging to identify the parts of the patients facial skeleton that need repositioning and determine the magnitude and direction of distraction they may then select the most appropriate distraction device or sometimes have custom devises fabricated when possible intraoral devices are used do surgery starts with an osteotomy surgical division or sectioning of bone followed by the distraction device being placed under the skin and across the osteotomy a few days later the two ends of the bone are very gradually pulled apart through continual adjustments that are made to the device by the parents at home the adjustments are made by turning a small screw that protrudes through the skin usually at a rate of 1mm per day this gradual distraction leads to formation of new bone between the two ends after the process is complete the osteotomy is allowed to heal over a period of six to eight weeks a small second surgery is then performed to remove the device the cleft palate is generally repaired between the ages of 6½ months and 2 years by a plastic or maxillofacial surgeon in many centres there is now a cleft lip and palate team comprising both of these specialties as well as a coordinator a speech and language therapist an orthodontist sometimes a psychologist or other mental health specialist an audiologist an otorhinolaryngologist ent surgeon and nursing staff the glossoptosis and micrognathism generally do not require surgery as they improve to some extent unaided though the mandibular arch remains significantly smaller than average in some cases jaw distraction is needed to aid in breathing and feeding liptongue attachment is performed in some centres though its efficacy has been recently questioned children affected with prs usually reach full development and size however it has been found internationally that the child is often slightly below average size raising concerns of incomplete development due to chronic hypoxia related to upper airway obstruction as well as lack of nutrition due to early feeding difficulties or the development of an oral aversion however the general prognosis is quite good once the initial breathing and feeding difficulties are overcome in infancy most prs babies grow to lead a healthy and normal adult life the most important medical problems are difficulties in breathing and feeding affected infants very often need assistance with feeding for example needing to stay in a lateralon the side or proneon the tummy position which helps bring the tongue forward and opens up the airway babies with a cleft palate will need a special cleft feeding device such as the haberman feeder infants who are unable to take in enough calories by mouth to ensure growth may need supplementation with a nasogastric tube this is related to the difficulty in forming a vacuum in the oral cavity related to the cleft palate as well as to breathing difficulty related to the posterior position of the tongue given the breathing difficulties that some babies with prs face they may require more calories to grow as working of breathing is somewhat like exercising for an infant infants when moderately to severely affected may occasionally need nasopharyngeal cannulation or placement of a nasopharyngeal tube to bypass the airway obstruction at the base of the tongue in some places children are discharged home with a nasopharyngeal tube for a period of time and parents are taught how to maintain the tube sometimes endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy may be indicated to overcome upper respiratory obstruction in some centers a tongue lip adhesion is performed to bring the tongue forward effectively opening up the airway mandibular distraction can be effective by moving the jaw forward to overcome the upper airway obstruction caused by the posterior positioning of the tongue given that a proportion of children with robin sequence will have stickler syndrome it is important that a child with prs have an evaluation by an optometrist or ophthalmologist in the first year of life looking for myopia that can be seen in stickler syndrome because retinal detachment that can occur in stickler syndrome is a leading cause of blindness in children it is very important to recognize and be thoughtful of this diagnosis the prevalence has been estimated at 1 in 10000 births  but exact values are hard to know because some that have the symptoms rarely have pierrerobin sequence without any other associated malformation the condition is named for pierre robin   noel rosa one of the most famous and influential artists in brazilian music history likely had prs

V porencephaly is an extremely rare cephalic disorder involving encephalomalacia  it is a neurological disorder of the central nervous system characterized by cysts or cavities within the cerebral hemisphere  porencephaly was termed by heschl in 1859 to describe a cavity in the human brain  the cysts and cavities are usually the result of destructive or cystic brain lesions but can also be from abnormal development direct damage inflammation or hemorrhage  the cysts and cavities cause a wide range of physiological physical and neurological symptoms  depending on the patient this disorder may cause only minor neurological problems without any disruption on intelligence while others may be severely disabled or face death before the second decade of their lives however this disorder is far more common within infants and porencephaly can occur in both before or after birth    patients diagnosed with porencephaly display a variety of symptoms from mild to severe effects on the patient patients with severe cases of porencephaly suffer epileptic seizures and developmental delays whereas patients with a mild case of porencephaly display little to no seizures and healthy neurodevelopment infants with extensive defects show symptoms of the disorder shortly after birth and the diagnosis is usually made before the age of 1   the following text lists out common signs and symptoms of porencephaly in affected individuals along with a short description of certain terminologies     porencephaly is a rare disorder the exact prevalence of porencephaly is not known however it has been reported that 68 of patients with cerebral palsy or 68 of patients with epilepsy and congenital vascular hemiparesis have porencephaly  porencephaly has a number of different often unknown causes including absence of brain development and destruction of brain tissue with limited research the most commonly regarded cause of porencephaly is disturbances in blood circulation ultimately leading to brain damage  however a number of different and multiple factors such as abnormal brain development or damage to the brain tissue can also affect the development of porencephaly  the following text lists out potential risk factors of developing porencephaly and porencephalic cysts and cavities along with brief description of certain terminologies     cysts or cavities can occur anywhere within the brain and the locations of these cysts depend highly on the patient cysts can develop in the frontal lobe parietal lobe forebrain hindbrain temporal lobe or virtually anywhere in the cerebral hemisphere  from recent studies de novo and inherited mutations in the gene col4a1 suggesting genetic predisposition within the family that encodes type iv collagen \u03b11 chain has shown to be associated with and present in patients with porencephaly col4a1 mutation causes a variety of phenotypes including porencephaly infantile hemiplegia and cerebral small vessel diseases involving both stroke and infarction  abnormal gene expression of col4a1 can contribute to the development of porencephaly col4a1 gene expresses a type iv collagen basement protein that is present in all tissue and blood vessels and is extremely important for the structural stability of vascular basement membranes the col4a1 protein provides a strong layer around blood vessels  the mutation can weaken the blood vessels within the brain elevating the probability of a hemorrhage and eventually promoting internal bleeding then leading to porencephaly during neurodevelopment of infantile stage  therefore the formation of cavities can be a result of hemorrhages which promote cerebral degeneration  in a mouse model mouse with col4a1 mutations displayed cerebral hemorrhage porencephaly and abnormal development of vascular basement membranes such as uneven edges inconsistent shapes and highly variable thickness  purposely causing a mutation in the col4a1 gene caused several mouse to develop cerebral hemorrhage and porencephalylike diseases though there is no direct correlation between mutations of the col4a1 gene it appears that it has an influential effect on the development of porencephaly    another genetic mutation factor v g1691a mutation has been reported to show possible association to the development of porencephaly a mutation in factor v g1691a increases the risk of thrombosis blood clots in neonates infants and children  therefore 76 porencephalic and 76 healthy infants were investigated for factor v g1691a mutation along with other different prothrombotic risk factors the results indicated that there was higher prevalence of the factor v g1691a mutation in the porencephalic patient group the prediction that childhood porencephaly is caused by hypercoagulable state a condition where one has a higher chance of developing blood clots was supported by the significance of the factor v g1691a mutation also pregnant women in hypercoagulable state can cause the fetus to have the same risks therefore possibly causing fetal loss brain damage lesions and infections that lead to porencephaly however other different prothrombotic risk factors individually did not reach statistical significance to link it to the development of porencephaly but a combination of multiple prothrombotic risk factors in the porencephaly group was significant overall factor v g1691a mutation has been linked to the development of porencephaly however this one mutation is not the cause of porencephaly and whether further prothrombiotic risk factors are associated with porencephaly still remains unknown  the presence of porencephalic cysts or cavities can be detected using transillumination of the skull of infant patients porencephaly is usually diagnosed clinically using the patients and families history clinical observations or based on the presence of certain characteristic neurological and physiological features of porencephaly advanced medical imaging with computed tomography ct magnetic resonance imaging mri or with ultrasonography can be used as a method to exclude other possible neurological disorders the diagnosis can be made antenatally with ultrasound other assessments include memory speech or intellect testing to help further determine the exact diagnose of the disorder  currently there is no cure for porencephaly because of the limited resources and knowledge about the neurological disorder however several treatment options are available treatment may include physical therapy rehabilitation medication for seizures or epilepsy shunt medical or neurosurgery removal of the cyst  according to the location extent of the lesion size of cavities and severity of the disorder combinations of treatment methods are imposed in porencephaly patients patients achieved good seizure control with appropriate drug therapy including valproate carbamazepine and clobazam   also antiepileptic drugs served as another positive method of treatment  the severity of the symptoms associated with porencephaly varies significantly across the population of those affected depending on the location of the cyst and damage of the brain for some patients with porencephaly only minor neurological problems may develop and those patients can live normal lives therefore based on the level of severity selfcare is possible but for the more serious cases lifelong care will be necessary  for those that have severe disability early diagnosis medication participation in rehabilitation related to finemotor control skills and communication therapies can significantly improve the symptoms and ability of the patient with porencephaly to live a normal life infants with porencephaly that survive with proper treatment can display proper communication skills movement and live a normal life under the united states federal government the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke and national institute of health are involved in conducting and supporting research related to normal and abnormal brain and nervous system development information gained from the research is used to develop understanding of the mechanism of porencephaly and used to offer new methods of treatment and prevention for developmental brain disorders such as porencephaly

V a palatal obturator is a prosthesis that totally occludes an opening such as an oronasal fistula in the roof of the mouth they are similar to dental retainers but without the front wire palatal obturators are typically shortterm prosthetics used to close defects of the hardsoft palate that may affect speech production or cause nasal regurgitation during feeding following surgery there may remain a residual orinasal opening on the palate alveolar ridge or labial vestibule a palatal obturator may be used to compensate for hypernasality and to aid in speech therapy targeting correction of compensatory articulation caused by the cleft palate in simpler terms a palatal obturator covers any fistulas or holes in the roof of the mouth that lead to the nasal cavity providing the wearer with a plasticacrylic removable roof of the mouth which aids in speech eating and proper air flow palatal obturators are not to be confused with palatal lifts or other prosthetic devices a palatal obturator may be used in cases of a deficiency in tissue when a remaining opening in the palate occurs in some cases it may be downsized gradually so that tissue can strengthen over time and compensate for the decreasing size of the obturator the palatal lift however is used when there is not enough palatal movement it raises the palate and reduces the range of movement necessary to provide adequate closure to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity speech bulbs and palatal lifts aid in velopharyngeal closure and do not obturate a fistula a speech bulb yet another type of prosthetic device often confused with a palatal obturator contains a pharyngeal section which goes behind the soft palate palatal obturators are needed by individuals with cleft palate those who have had tumors removed or have had traumatic injuries to their palate   a palatal plate is a prosthetic device generally consisting of an acrylic plate and retention clasps of orthodontic wire which covers a fistula of the palate it may be used to aid in improving articulation and feeding the blockage of the opening helps improve hypernasality and suckling ability for babies in the case of a labialoralnasal fistula the plate may include an anterior upward extension to fully occlude the passageway running between the labial surface of the alveolus alveolus and nasal cavity the plate may be constructed to include any congenitally missing teeth to improve articulation and appearance individuals who use palatal plates must be monitored periodically by their dental professionals due to possible tissue irritation by the plate materials such as food particles oral mucosa and secretions may cause buildup on the upper surface of the plate therefore it is essential to clean a palatal obturator at least twice a day to avoid tissue irritation there are also more specific terms used for obturators depending on their time and purpose of use photo examples of the latham device or the nasal alveolar are prime examples for use in cleft palate deformities the latham device post latham nasal alveolar molding device post insertion palatal adhesives are oral adhesives or skin barrier materials used to occlude a fistula of the hard palate obturators of this type must be removed before eating and drinking users must cut the new piece of adhesive and hold it over the fistula until it adheres adhesives are not to be used for soft palate fistulae if the soft palate has some mobility due to possible unintentional dislodging and digestion of the material this fixed obturator is based on the nance appliance which was originally used as a space maintainer in dentistry and orthodontics but has been redesigned for closing anterior palatal fistulas in patients with cleft lip and palate the nance obturator may be used when the surgical closure of the fistula is not feasible and a removable device is not successful often a palatal obturator is used because a palatal fistula can affect development and proper articulation as fistula sizes vary small fistulae tend to result in little to no speech alterations whereas large fistulae tend to result in audible nasal emissions and weak pressure with andor without hypernasality misarticulations abnormal nasal resonance and nasal escape or air often results from the problem fistulae may decrease intraoral air pressure during production of oral pressure consonants causing distortion of sounds as well as increase in nasal airflow it is common for an individual with a fistula to compensate for a loss of pressure during speech sound production by attempting to regulate intraoral air pressure with increasing respiration effort and using compensatory articulation middorsum palatal stops atypical place of articulation often results from palatal fistulae causing sound distortions during speech occlusion for the fistula is attempted by speakers with deviant tongue placements during these palatal stops the palatal obturation may be managed temporarily or may be sustained for longer periods of time locationspecific palatal obturation has been documented to significantly improve articulation errors hypernasality based on listener judgments and nasal emissions immediately postobturation only usage of more anterior tongue placements is considered a primary target for speech therapy the relationship between palatal openings and articulation is important to note prior to surgical plans to ascertain timing of speech therapy and most appropriate therapy goals and approach speech therapy may be most beneficial prior to sustained palatal obturation rather than shortterm obturation

V acalvaria is a rare malformation consisting of absence of the calvarial bones dura mater and associated muscles in the presence of a normal skull base and normal facial bones the central nervous system is usually unaffected the presumed pathogenesis of acalvaria is faulty migration of the membranous neurocranium with normal placement of the embryonic ectoderm resulting in absence of the calvaria but an intact layer of skin over the brain parenchyma in other words instead of having a skull cap protecting the brain there is only skin covering it  the size of the area that is missing the skull cap can vary from case to case in extreme cases the entire top part of the cranium that is domeshaped may be absent    there are four main signs of acalvaria absence of the flat bones of the cranial vault absence of the dura mater and muscles associated with it skull abnormalities and the absence of a skull cap  this condition can be diagnosed prior to birth using ultrasonography physicians often use magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis because in utero acalvaria is sometimes confused with anencephaly or encephalocele  a distinguishable difference is that with anencephaly the cerebral hemispheres are missing but with acalvaria all parts of the cerebrum are usually present and developed whereas parts of the calvarium are missing  currently there is no identified cause of acalvaria  the primary presumed pathogenesis is problematic migration of the membranous neurocranium with respect to the normal positioning of the immature ectoderm  when an embryo develops normally the anterior neural pore closes about the fourth week after this occurs mesenchymal tissue migrates under the ectoderm this ectoderm underlies where the cerebral hemisphere will eventually be when a fetus has acalvaria the embryonic ectoderm is in its correct place but the mesenchymal migration does not occur correctly therefore acalvaria is considered to be a postneurulation defect  because it is a postneurulation defect it must develop after embryonic stage 11 between 24 and 26 days after conception  because this malformation is rare and there are extremely few individuals living with this condition treatment is limited treatment consists of carefully managing the condition in a controlled manner proceeding with a bone graft when the child reaches school age is also recommended  usually babies with this malformation do not survive past birth  however there have been cases of survival as of 2004 there were only two reported living cases of these two one was severely cognitively impaired and physically disabled the status of the other was unreported if the fetus progresses to full term there is the risk that it will have head trauma from the pressure applied to the head while being delivered  a few other cases of acalvaria have been reported which did not progress to birth in addition to the lack skull cap there were brain malformations present in each case and all of the pregnancies were terminated either electively or the fetuses were spontaneously aborted  acalvaria usually occurs in less than 1 of every 100000 births  by way of epidemiological data it is thought that females are more prone to have this defect currently acalvaria is not thought to have much of a risk of recurrence

V doxorubicin sold under the trade names adriamycin among others is a medication used in cancer chemotherapy it is derived by chemical semisynthesis from a bacterial species  it is an anthracycline antitumor antibiotic note in this context this does not mean it is used to treat bacterial infections closely related to the natural product daunomycin and like all anthracyclines it works by intercalating dna with the most serious adverse effect being lifethreatening heart damage it is commonly used in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including hematological malignancies blood cancers like leukaemia and lymphoma many types of carcinoma solid tumours and soft tissue sarcomas  it is often used in combination chemotherapy as a component of various chemotherapy regimens common adverse effects of doxorubicin include hair loss seen in most of those treated with the drug myelosuppression a compromised ability of the bodys bone marrow to produce new blood cells nausea and vomiting which are seen in roughly 3090 of people treated with the drug oral mucositis oesophagitis diarrhoea skin reactions including handfoot syndrome and localised swelling and redness along the vein in which the drug is delivered   less common yet serious reactions include hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis radiation recall heart damage and liver dysfunction  it is on the world health organizations list of essential medicines the most important medication needed in a basic health system  the drug is administered intravenously as the hydrochloride salt  doxorubicin is photosensitive and containers are often covered by an aluminum bag andor brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it  doxorubicin is also available in liposomeencapsulated forms as doxil pegylated form myocet nonpegylated form and caelyx although these forms must also be given by intravenous injection    doxorubicin is commonly used to treat some leukemias and hodgkins lymphoma as well as cancers of the bladder breast stomach lung ovaries thyroid soft tissue sarcoma multiple myeloma and others   commonly used doxorubicincontaining regimens are ac adriamycin cyclophosphamide tac taxotere ac abvd adriamycin bleomycin vinblastine dacarbazine beacopp chop cyclophosphamide hydroxydaunorubicin vincristine prednisone and fac 5fluorouracil adriamycin cyclophosphamide  doxil see below is used primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer where the disease has progressed or recurred after platinumbased chemotherapy or for the treatment of aidsrelated kaposis sarcoma  there is a pegylated polyethylene glycol coated liposomeencapsulated form of doxorubicin sold as doxil it was developed to treat kaposis sarcoma an aidsrelated cancer that causes lesions to grow under the skin in the lining of the mouth nose and throat or in other organs the polyethylene glycol coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin however this also results in a side effect called palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia ppe more commonly known as handfoot syndrome following administration of this form of doxorubicin small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet the result of this leakage is redness tenderness and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful in clinical testing at 50mgm  dosing every 4 weeks half of people developed handfoot syndrome the rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen thereby limiting potential substitution substitution would be desirable because liposomeencapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin this form is also approved by the fda for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma   a nonpegylated liposomal doxorubicin called myocet is approved in europe and canada for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide but has not been approved by the fda for use in the united states unlike doxil the myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating and therefore does not result in the same rate of handfoot syndrome the minimization of this side effect may allow for one for one substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy like doxil the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity in theory by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs such as trastuzumab there is an fda black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin only in sequential combination though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure chf published phase ii study results have shown that myocet trastuzumab and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk as measured by reduction in lvef function while still achieving superior tumor response this finding is the basis for the ongoing phase iii trial for fda approval  the most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure the rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose with an incidence about 4 when the dose of doxorubicin is 500550mgm² 18 when the dose is 551600mgm² and 36 when the dose exceeds 600mgm²  there are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy including oxidative stress downregulation of genes for contractile proteins and p53 mediated apoptosis  the drug dexrazoxane is used to mitigate doxorubicins cardiotoxicity another common and potentially fatal complication of doxorubicin is typhlitis an acute lifethreatening infection of the bowel  additionally some patients may develop ppe characterized by skin eruptions on the palms of the hand or soles of the feet swelling pain and erythema  due to these side effects and its red color doxorubicin has earned the nickname red devil  or red death  chemotherapy can cause reactivation of hepatitis b and doxorubicincontaining regimens are no exception   doxorubicin and several chemotherapeutic drugs including cyclophosphamide cause dyspigmentation other groups of drugs that cause this problem include antimalarials amiodarone heavy metals but not iron tetracyclines and antipsychotics  doxorubicin dxr is a 14hydroxylated version of daunorubicin the immediate precursor of dxr in its biosynthetic pathway daunorubicin is more abundantly found as a natural product because it is produced by a number of different wild type strains of streptomyces in contrast only one known nonwild type species streptomyces peucetius subspecies cesius atcc 27952 was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin  this strain was created by arcamone et al in 1969 by mutating a strain producing daunorubicin but not dxr at least in detectable quantities  subsequently hutchinsons group showed that under special environmental conditions or by the introduction of genetic modifications other strains of streptomyces can produce doxorubicin  his group has also cloned many of the genes required for dxr production although not all of them have been fully characterized in 1996 strohls group discovered isolated and characterized dox a the gene encoding the enzyme that converts daunorubicin into dxr  by 1999 they produced recombinant dox a a cytochrome p450 oxidase and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in dxr biosynthesis including steps leading to daunorubicin  this was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicinproducing strains have the necessary genes to produce dxr the much more therapeutically important of the two hutchinsons group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of dxr from the fermentation process used in its commercial production not only by introducing dox a encoding plasmids but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt dxr precursors to less useful products for example baumycinlike glycosides  some triple mutants that also overexpressed dox a were able to double the yield of dxr this is of more than academic interest because at that time dxr cost about 137 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225kg per annum  more efficient production techniques have brought the price down to 11 million per kg for the nonliposomal formulation although dxr can be produced semisynthetically from daunorubicin the process involves electrophilic bromination and multiple steps and the yield is poor  since daunorubicin is produced by fermentation it would be ideal if the bacteria could complete dxr synthesis more effectively doxorubicin interacts with dna by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis    this inhibits the progression of the enzyme topoisomerase ii which relaxes supercoils in dna for transcription  doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase ii complex after it has broken the dna chain for replication preventing the dna double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication  it may also increase quinone type free radical production hence contributing to its cytotoxicity  the planar aromatic chromophore portion of the molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the dna while the sixmembered daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site as evidenced by several crystal structures   by intercalation doxorubicin can also induce histone eviction from transcriptionally active chromatin   as a result dna damage response epigenome and transcriptome are deregulated in doxorubicinexposed cells  in the 1950s an italian research company farmitalia research laboratories began an organized effort to find anticancer compounds from soilbased microbes a soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the castel del monte a 13thcentury castle a new strain of streptomyces peucetius which produced a red pigment was isolated and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice since a group of french researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time the two teams named the compound daunorubicin combining the name dauni a preroman tribe that occupied the area of italy where the compound was isolated with the french word for ruby rubis describing the color  clinical trials began in the 1960s and the drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma however by 1967 it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity  researchers at farmitalia soon discovered that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes in the structure of the compound a strain of streptomyces was mutated using nnitrosonmethyl urethane and this new strain produced a different redcolored antibiotic they named this new compound adriamycin after the adriatic sea and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention  doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors and especially solid tumors it also showed a higher therapeutic index yet the cardiotoxicity remained  doxorubicin and daunorubicin together can be thought of as prototype compounds for the anthracyclines subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics or analogs and there are now over 2000 known analogs of doxorubicin by 1991 553 of them had been evaluated in the screening program at the national cancer institute nci  in 2016 gpx150 was granted orphan drug designation by us fda  it is also known as hydroxydaunorubicin and hydroxydaunomycin it is sold under a number of different brand names including adriamycin pfs adriamycin rdf or rubex  as of february 2014 doxil was available in limited supply  in 2011 doxil became available only in very limited supply due to production problems with the thirdparty manufacturer johnson  johnson jnj through its subsidiary janssen products lp had been receiving its doxil supply from contract manufacturer ben venue laboratories located in bedford ohio a unit of boehringer ingelheim gmbh of germany  the problems began when ben venue temporarily shut down their manufacturing facility due to quality control issues  in february 2012 to address the doxil shortage the us food and drug administration fda allowed for the temporary importation of lipodox which contains the same active ingredient as doxil and is made by sun pharma global fze sun a subsidiary of indias sun pharmaceutical industries ltd  the agency said it intends to continue allowing the importation of lipodox until sun has made enough generic doxil to meet demand  the fda approved the first generic version of doxil made by sun in february 2013 it will be available in 20 milligram and 50 milligram vials  combination therapy experiments with sirolimus rapamycin and doxorubicin have shown promise in treating aktpositive lymphomas in mice  recent animal research coupling a murine monoclonal antibody with doxorubicin has created an immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate hiv1 infection in mice current treatment with antiretroviral therapy art still leaves pockets of hiv within the host the immunoconjugate could potentially provide a complementary treatment to art to eradicate antigenexpressing t cells  there is some evidence for antimalarial activity for doxorubicin and similar compounds in 2009 a compound similar in structure to doxorubicin was found to inhibit plasmepsin ii an enzyme unique to the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum  the pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline gsk later identified doxorubicin in a set of compounds that inhibit parasite growth

V esophageal atresia or oesophageal atresia is a congenital medical condition birth defect which affects the alimentary tract it causes the esophagus to end in a blindended pouch rather than connecting normally to the stomach it comprises a variety of congenital anatomic defects that are caused by an abnormal embryological development of the esophagus it is characterized anatomically by a congenital obstruction of the esophagus with interruption of the continuity of the esophageal wall    it occurs in approximately 1 in 2500 live births  congenital esophageal atresia ea represents a failure of the esophagus to develop as a continuous passage instead it ends as a blind pouch tracheoesophageal fistula tef represents an abnormal opening between the trachea and esophagus ea and tef can occur separately or together ea and tef are diagnosed in the icu at birth and treated immediately the presence of ea is suspected in an infant with excessive salivation drooling and in a newborn with drooling that is frequently accompanied by choking coughing and sneezing when fed these infants swallow normally but begin to cough and struggle as the fluid returns through the nose and mouth the infant may become cyanotic turn bluish due to lack of oxygen and may stop breathing as the overflow of fluid from the blind pouch is aspirated sucked into the trachea the cyanosis is a result of laryngospasm a protective mechanism that the body has to prevent aspiration into the trachea over time respiratory distress will develop if any of the above signssymptoms are noticed a catheter is gently passed into the esophagus to check for resistance if resistance is noted other studies will be done to confirm the diagnosis a catheter can be inserted and will show up as white on a regular xray film to demonstrate the blind pouch ending sometimes a small amount of barium chalklike liquid is placed through the mouth to diagnose the problems treatment of ea and tef is surgery to repair the defect if ea or tef is suspected all oral feedings are stopped and intravenous fluids are started the infant will be positioned to help drain secretions and decrease the likelihood of aspiration babies with ea may sometimes have other problems studies will be done to look at the heart spine and kidneys surgery to repair ea is essential as the baby will not be able to feed and is highly likely to develop pneumonia once the baby is in condition for surgery an incision is made on the side of the chest the esophagus can usually be sewn together following surgery the baby may be hospitalized for a variable length of time care for each infant is individualized its very commonly seen in a newborn with imperforate anus this condition takes several different forms often involving one or more fistulas connecting the trachea to the esophagus tracheoesophageal fistula this birth defect arises in the fourth fetal week when the trachea and esophagus should begin to separate from each other it can be associated with disorders of the tracheoesophageal septum  other birth defects may coexist particularly in the heart but sometimes also in the anus spinal column or kidneys this is known as vacterl association because of the involvement of vertebral column anorectal cardiac tracheal esophageal renal and limbs it is associated with polyhydramnios in the third trimester this condition is visible after about 26 weeks on an ultrasound on antenatal usg the finding of an absent or small stomach in the setting of polyhydramnios was considered a potential symptom of esophageal atresia however these findings have a low positive predictive value the upper neck pouch sign is another sign that helps in the antenatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia and it may be detected soon after birth as the affected infant will be unable to swallow its own saliva also the newborn can present with gastric distention cough apnea tachypnea and cyanosis in many types of esophageal atresia a feeding tube will not pass through the esophagus any attempt at feeding could cause aspiration pneumonia as the milk collects in the blind pouch and overflows into the trachea and lungs furthermore a fistula between the lower esophagus and trachea may allow stomach acid to flow into the lungs and cause damage because of these dangers the condition must be treated as soon as possible after birth treatments for the condition vary depending on its severity the most immediate and effective treatment in the majority of cases is a surgical repair to close the fistulas and reconnect the two ends of the esophagus to each other although this is usually done through an incision between the ribs on right side of the baby a technique using three small incisions thoracoscopy is being used at some centers in a minority of cases the gap between upper and lower esophageal segments may be too long to bridge in some of these socalled long gap cases though an advanced surgical treatment developed by john foker md  may be utilized to elongate and then join together the short esophageal segments using the foker technique surgeons place traction sutures in the tiny esophageal ends and increase the tension on these sutures daily until the ends are close enough to be sewn together the result is a normally functioning esophagus virtually indistinguishable from one congenitally well formed unfortunately the results have been somewhat difficult to replicate by other surgeons and the need for multiple operations has tempered enthusiasm for this approach the optimal treatment in cases of long gap esophageal atresia remains controversial  traditional surgical approaches include gastrostomy followed by gastric pullup colonic transposition and jejunum transposition  gastric pullup has been the preferred approach at many specialized centers including great ormond street london and mott childrens hospital ann arbor  gastrostomy or gtube allows for tube feedings into the stomach through the abdominal wall often a cervical esophagostomy will also be done to allow the saliva which is swallowed to drain out a hole in the neck months or years later the esophagus may be repaired sometimes by using a segment of bowel brought up into the chest interposing between the upper and lower segments of esophagus post operative complications sometimes arise including a leak at the site of closure of the esophagus sometimes a stricture or tight spot will develop in the esophagus making it difficult to swallow this can usually be dilated using medical instruments in later life most children with this disorder will have some trouble with either swallowing or heartburn or both tracheomalaciaa softening of the trachea usually above the carina carina of trachea but sometimes extensive in the lower bronchial tree as wellis another possible serious complication even after esophageal repair anastomosis the relative flaccidity of former proximal pouch blind pouch above along with esophageal dysmotility can cause fluid buildup during feeding owing to proximity pouch ballooning can cause tracheal occlusion severe hypoxia dying spells follows and medical intervention can often be required a variety of treatments for tracheomalacia associated with esophageal atresia are available if not severe the condition can be managed expectantly since the trachea will usually stiffen as the infant matures into the first year of life when only the trachea above the carina is compromised one of the simplest interventions is aortopexy wherein the aortic loop is attached to the rear of the sternum thereby mechanically relieving pressure from the softened trachea an even simpler intervention is stenting however epithelial cell proliferation and potential incorporation of the stent into the trachea can make subsequent removal dangerous a method for repairing longgap esophageal atresia using magnets has been developed that does not require replacing the missing section with grafts of the intestine or other body parts using electromagnetic force to attract the upper and lower ends of the esophagus together was first tried in the 1970s by using steel pellets attracted to each other by applying external electromagnets to the patient in the 2000s a further refinement was developed by mario zaritzkys group and others the newer method uses permanent magnets and a balloon in april 2015 annalise dapo became the first patient in the united states to have their esophageal atresia corrected using magnets

V trevor disease also known as fairbanks disease and trevors disease is a congenital bone developmental disorder there is 1 case per million population the condition is three times more common in males than in females   this disorder is rare and is characterised by an asymmetrical limb deformity due to localized overgrowth of cartilage histologically resembling osteochondroma it is believed to affect the limb bud in early fetal life the condition occurs mostly in the ankle or knee region and it is always confined to a single limb this usually involves only the lower extremities and on medial side of the epiphysis it is named after researcher david trevor  trevor disease was first described by the french surgeon albert mouchet and j belot in 1926 in 1956 the name dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica was proposed by fairbank  the usual symptoms are the appearance of an osseous protuberance on one side of the knee ankle or foot joint which gradually increases radiologically  the condition shows a nonuniformity of growth and multiple unconnected ossification centers around the epiphyses  trevor disease can often mimic posttraumatic osseous fragments   synovial chondromatosis ostechondroma or anterior spur of ankle     it is not possible to distinguish deh from osteochondroma on the basis of histopathology alone   special molecular tests of the genes ext1 ext2 are used for the analysis of genetic expressions these are within normal ranges in deh while they are lower in ostechondroma owing to a mutation     these tests are expensive and the diagnosis is often made on clinical and radiological findings synovial chondromatosis occurs in a much older age group and can be ruled out on this basis  most reported cases of deh in the literature have been treated surgically with excision of the mass as well as by the correction of any deformity while preserving the integrity of the affected joint as much as possible

hypodactyly or confused with aphalangia the absence of the phalanx bone on one or commonly more digits when all the digits on a hand or foot are absent it is referred to as adactyly  ectrodactyly also known as splithand malformation is the congenital absence of one or more central digits of the hands and feet consequently it is a form of oligodactyly news anchor bree walker is probably the bestknown person with this condition which affects about one in 91000 people  it is conspicuously more common in the vadoma in zimbabwe anisodactyly is the most common arrangement of digits in birds with three toes forward and one back this is common in songbirds and other perching birds as well as hunting birds like eagles hawks and falcons syndactyly as it occurs in birds is like anisodactyly except that the third and fourth toes the outer and middle forwardpointing toes or three toes are fused together as in the belted kingfisher megaceryle alcyon this is characteristic of coraciiformes kingfishers beeeaters rollers and relatives zygodactyly from greek \u03b6\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 even is an arrangement of digits in birds and chameleons with two toes facing forward digits 2 and 3 and two back digits 1 and 4 this arrangement is most common in arboreal species particularly those that climb tree trunks or clamber through foliage zygodactyly occurs in the parrots woodpeckers including flickers cuckoos including roadrunners and some owls zygodactyl tracks have been found dating to 120110 ma early cretaceous 50 million years before the first identified zygodactyl fossils  heterodactyly is like zygodactyly except that digits 3 and 4 point forward and digits 1 and 2 point back this is found only in trogons pamprodactyly is an arrangement in which all four toes point forward outer toes toe 1 and sometimes 4 often if not regularly reversible it is a characteristic of swifts apodidae and mousebirds coliiformes the feet of chameleons are organized into bundles of a group of two and a group of three digits which oppose one another to grasp branches in a pincerlike arrangement this condition has been called zygodactyly or didactyly however the specific arrangement in chameleons does not fit either definition the feet of the front limbs in chameleons for instance are organized into a medial bundle of digits 1 2 and 3 and a lateral bundle of digits 4 and 5 while the feet of the hind limbs are organized into a medial bundle of digits 1 and 2 and a lateral bundle of digits 3 4 and 5  zygodactyly by definition on the other hand involves digits 1 and 4 opposing digits 2 and 3 while chameleons do not exhibit this arrangement in either front of hind limbs further didactyly involves only two digits per limb while chameleons have five digits despite being bundled into two opposing bundles schizodactyly is a primate term for grasping and clinging with the second and third digit instead of the thumb and second digit

V thumb hypoplasia is a spectrum of congenital abnormalities of the thumb varying from small defects to complete absence of the thumb  it can be isolated when only the thumb is affected and in 60 of the cases  it is associated with radial dysplasia  or radial club radius dysplasia longitudinal radial deficiency radial dysplasia is the condition in which the forearm bone and the soft tissues on the thumb side are underdeveloped or absent  in an embryo the upper extremities develop from week four of the gestation  during the fifth to eighth week the thumb will further develop  in this period something goes wrong with the growth of the thumb but the exact cause of thumb hypoplasia is unknown  one out of every 100000 live births shows thumb hypoplasia  in more than 50 of the cases both hands are affected otherwise mainly the right hand is affected   about 86 of the children with hypoplastic thumb have associated abnormalities   embryological hand development occurs simultaneously with growth and development of the cardiovascular neurologic and hematopoietic systems  thumb hypoplasia has been described in 30 syndromes wherein those abnormalities have been seen a syndrome is a combination of three or more abnormalities examples of syndromes with an hypoplastic thumb are holtoram syndrome vacterl association  and thrombocytopenia absent radius tar syndrome    in general there are five types of thumb hypoplasia originally described by muller in 1937 and improved by blauth buckgramcko and manske   type i the thumb is small normal components are present but undersized  two muscles of the thumb the abductor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis are not fully developed    this type requires no surgical treatment in most cases    type ii is characterized by a tight web space between the thumb and index finger which restricts movement  poor thenar muscles and an unstable middle joint of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint  this unstable thumb is best treated with reconstruction of the mentioned structures   type iii thumbs are subclassified into two subtypes by manske both involve a less developed first metacarpal and a nearly absent thenar musculature  type iiia has a fairly stable carpometacarpal joint and type iiib does not    the function of the thumb is poor  children with type iii are the most difficult patients to treat because there is not one specific treatment for the hypoplastic thumb the limit between pollicization and reconstruction varies some surgeons have said that type iiia is amenable to reconstruction and not type iiib others say type iiia is not suitable for reconstruction too  based on the diagnosis the doctor has to decide what is needed to be done to obtain a more functional thumb ie reconstruction or pollicization in this group careful attention should be paid to anomalous tendons coming from the forearm extrinsic muscles like an aberrant long thumb flexor  flexor pollicis longus     type iv is called a pouce flottant floating thumb     this thumb has a neurovascular bundle which connects it to the skin of the hand    theres no evidence of thenar muscles and rarely functioning tendons   it has a few rudimentary bones   children with type iv are difficult to reconstruct   this type is nearly always treated with an index finger pollicization to improve hand function    type v is no thumb at all   and requires pollicization   three main points in diagnosing thumb hypoplasia are width of the first web space instability of the involved joints and function of the thumb  thorough physical examination together with anatomic verification at operation reveals all the anomalies   an xray of the hand and thumb in two directions is always mandatory  when the pediatrician thinks the condition is associated with some kind of syndrome other tests will be done  more subtle manifestations of types i and ii may not be recognized especially when more obvious manifestations of longitudinal radial deficiency in the opposite extremity are present therefore a careful examination of both hands is important  when it comes to treatment it is important to differentiate a thumb that needs stability more web width and function or a thumb that needs to be replaced by the index finger  severe thumb hypoplasia is best treated by pollicization of the index finger   less severe thumb hypoplasia can be reconstructed by first web space release ligament reconstruction and muscle or tendon transfer   it has been recommended that pollicization is performed before 12 months but a longterm study of pollicizations performed between the age of 9 months and 16 years showed no differences in function related to age at operation  it is important to know that every reconstruction of the thumb never gives a normal thumb because there is always a decline of function  when a child has a good index finger wrist and forearm the maximum strength of the thumb will be 50 after surgery in comparison with a normal thumb   the less developed the index finger wrist and forearm is the less strength the reconstructed thumb will have after surgery

V lysosomal storage diseases lsds \u02ccla\u026as\u0259\u02c8so\u028am\u0259l are a group of approximately 50 rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in lysosomal function  lysosomes are sacs of enzymes within cells that digest large molecules and pass the fragments on to other parts of the cell for recycling this process requires several critical enzymes if one of these enzymes is defective because of a mutation the large molecules accumulate within the cell eventually killing it  lysosomal storage disorders are caused by lysosomal dysfunction usually as a consequence of deficiency of a single enzyme required for the metabolism of lipids glycoproteins sugar containing proteins or socalled mucopolysaccharides individually lsds occur with incidences of less than 1100000 however as a group the incidence is about 15000  110000  most of these disorders are autosomal recessively inherited such as niemannpick disease type c however a few are xlinked recessively inherited such as fabry disease and hunter syndrome mps ii the lysosome is commonly referred to as the cells recycling center because it processes unwanted material into substances that the cell can utilize lysosomes break down this unwanted matter via enzymes highly specialized proteins essential for survival lysosomal disorders are usually triggered when a particular enzyme exists in too small an amount or is missing altogether when this happens substances accumulate in the cell in other words when the lysosome does not function normally excess products destined for breakdown and recycling are stored in the cell like other genetic diseases individuals inherit lysosomal storage diseases from their parents although each disorder results from different gene mutations that translate into a deficiency in enzyme activity they all share a common biochemical characteristic  all lysosomal disorders originate from an abnormal accumulation of substances inside the lysosome lysosomal storage diseases affect mostly children and they often die at a young and unpredictable age many within a few months or years of birth many other children die of this disease following years of suffering from various symptoms of their particular disorder    the lysosomal storage diseases are generally classified by the nature of the primary stored material involved and can be broadly broken into the following icd10 codes are provided where available also glycogen storage disease type ii pompe disease is also a defect in lysosomal metabolism  although it is otherwise classified into e740 in icd10 cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine alternatively to the protein targets lysosomal storage diseases may be classified by the type of protein that is deficient and is causing buildup following are lysosomal storage diseases sphingolipidoses mucopolysaccharidoses mucolipidosis lipidoses oligosaccharide lysosomal transport diseases glycogen storage diseases other the symptoms of lysosomal storage disease vary depending on the particular disorder and other variables like the age of onset and can be mild to severe they can include developmental delay movement disorders seizures dementia deafness andor blindness some people with lysosomal storage disease have enlarged livers hepatomegaly and enlarged spleens splenomegaly pulmonary and cardiac problems and bones that grow abnormally the majority of patients are initially screened by enzyme assay which is the most efficient method to arrive at a definitive diagnosis in some families where the diseasecausing mutations is known and in certain genetic isolates mutation analysis may be performed in addition after a diagnosis is made by biochemical means mutation analysis may be performed for certain disorders there are no cures for lysosomal storage diseases and treatment is mostly symptomatic although bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy ert have been tried with some success   in addition umbilical cord blood transplantation is being performed at specialized centers for a number of these diseases in addition substrate reduction therapy a method used to decrease the accumulation of storage material is currently being evaluated for some of these diseases furthermore chaperone therapy a technique used to stabilize the defective enzymes produced by patients is being examined for certain of these disorders the experimental technique of gene therapy may offer cures in the future  ambroxol has recently been shown to increase activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase because of this it may be a useful therapeutic agent for both gaucher disease and parkinsons disease   ambroxol triggers the secretion of lysosomes from cells by inducing a phdependent calcium release from acidic calcium stores  hence relieving the cell from accumulating degradation products is a proposed mechanism by which this drug may help taysachs disease was the first of these disorders to be described in 1881 followed by gaucher disease in 1882 in the late 1950s and early 1960s de duve and colleagues using cell fractionation techniques cytological studies and biochemical analyses identified and characterized the lysosome as a cellular organelle responsible for intracellular digestion and recycling of macromolecules this was the scientific breakthrough that would lead to the understanding of the physiological basis of the lysosomal storage diseases pompe disease was the first disease to be identified as an lsd in 1963 with l hers reporting the cause as a deficiency of \u03b1glucosidase hers also suggested that other diseases such as the mucopolysaccharidosis might be due to enzyme deficiencies

V inborn errors of metabolism form a large class of genetic diseases involving congenital disorders of metabolism the majority are due to defects of single genes that code for enzymes that facilitate conversion of various substances substrates into others products in most of the disorders problems arise due to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal function or to the effects of reduced ability to synthesize essential compounds inborn errors of metabolism are now often referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic diseases the term inborn error of metabolism was coined by a british physician archibald garrod 18571936 in the early 20th century 1908 he is known for work that prefigured the one geneone enzyme hypothesis based on his studies on the nature and inheritance of alkaptonuria his seminal text inborn errors of metabolism was published in 1923    traditionally the inherited metabolic diseases were classified as disorders of carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism organic acid metabolism or lysosomal storage diseases in recent decades hundreds of new inherited disorders of metabolism have been discovered and the categories have proliferated following are some of the major classes of congenital metabolic diseases with prominent examples of each class many others do not fall into these categories because of the enormous number of these diseases and wide range of systems affected nearly every presenting complaint to a doctor may have a congenital metabolic disease as a possible cause especially in childhood the following are examples of potential manifestations affecting each of the major organ systems many manifestations may develop dozens of congenital metabolic diseases are now detectable by newborn screening tests especially the expanded testing using mass spectrometry this is an increasingly common way for the diagnosis to be made and sometimes results in earlier treatment and a better outcome there is a revolutionary gcms based technology with an integrated analytics system which has now made it possible to test a newborn for over 100 mmgenetic metabolic disorders because of the multiplicity of conditions many different diagnostic tests are used for screening an abnormal result is often followed by a subsequent definitive test to confirm the suspected diagnosis common screening tests used in the last sixty years specific diagnostic tests or focused screening for a small set of disorders a 2015 review reported that even with all these diagnostic tests there are cases when biochemical testing gene sequencing and enzymatic testing can neither confirm nor rule out an iem resulting in the need to rely on the patients clinical course   in the middle of the 20th century the principal treatment for some of the amino acid disorders was restriction of dietary protein and all other care was simply management of complications in the past twenty years enzyme replacement gene therapy and organ transplantation have become available and beneficial for many previously untreatable disorders some of the more common or promising therapies are listed in a study in british columbia the overall incidence of the inborn errors of metabolism were estimated to be 40 per 100000 live births or 1 in 1400 births  overall representing more than approximately 15 of single gene disorders in the population   the national institutes of health offers theoffice of rare diseases home reference medlineplus andhealth information the national human genome research institute hosts an information center a section forpatients and the public and additionaleducational resources support groups can be found atnord genetic alliance and orphanet the genetic education center at the kumc has many more useful links

V a persistent thyroglossal duct is a usually benign medical condition in which the thyroglossal duct a structure usually only found during embryonic development fails to atrophy the duct persists as a midline structure forming an open connection between the back of the tongue and the thyroid glandthis opening can lead to fluid accumulation and infection which necessitate the removal of the duct   during the third week of development the thyroid gland begins to develop from the floor of the pharynx this primordium begins as an evagination between the first and second pharyngeal grooves relatively where the anterior twothirds of the tongue ends  this area is known as the foramen cecum and marks the origin of the thyroglossal duct as the developing thyroid begins to travel to its intended destination it remains connected to the tongue via the thyroglossal duct by the seventh week of fetal development the thyroid reaches its final position in the neck after growing through the mesoderm and musculature of the tongue mouth and neck during the eighth to tenth week the cells of the duct normally begin growing inwards and fill the previously hollow tube beginning from the inferior end this inferior end of the duct will then become the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland the dividing cellular cords of the tubular duct become the isthmus and lateral lobes of the gland to complete the formation of the rest of the gland  once the thyroglossal duct involutes the cells will begin to degenerate and disappear however in the case of a persistent thyroglossal duct the tube remains hollow and continues to connect the foramen cecum to the thyroid gland the tongue develops after the thyroid primordium so the foramen cecum becomes buried at the base of the tongue the thyroglossal duct then continues through the neck and lies anterior to the laryngeal cartilage the duct then passes anteriorly to the developing hyoid bone however as the bone continues to grow it can continue to grow posteriorly become anterior or even grow to surround the duct the duct is found very close to the medial line of the neck the duct continues in front of the thyrohyoid membrane sternothyroid muscle and sternohyoid muscle before terminating in the inferior segment of the neck at the thyroid  failures of duct removal surgeries have proven that the suprahyoid region of the duct can have many microscopic branches that connect to the base of the tongue these accessory tracts are vast and irregular and can often not be detected by surgeons  they exhibit variability between different cases however it is believed they are associated with the pharyngeal mucosa and muscles of the tongue the cells of the thyroglossal duct are epithelial in origin the cell shapes can range from columnar to squamous to transitional epithelium thyroidlike masses can also be seen in close relation along the duct enclosed vesicles and cysts can also be seen while studying the tissue of the duct a persistent thyroglossal duct in a rabbit showed resemblance to the layout of the alimentary canal with its external fibrous connective tissue muscular layers submucosal glands and convoluted epithelium  studies done on cadavers claim persistent thyroglossal ducts can be completely asymptomatic and found in 7 of the human adult population  however the continued presence of the duct can often lead to complications due to infections and fluid buildup the glands in the mucosa of the duct will continue their secretions until the fluid forms a cyst or exit the duct via the opening in the foramen cecum local infections such as colds tonsillitis or inflammation of the lymph nodes in the area can also lead to the accumulation of fluid within the duct  even if the cyst forms as secondary to another infection and improved after antibiotics it will often reoccur and require treatment threefourths of abnormalities within a persistent thyroglossal duct involve the formation of a cyst  if a persistent thyroglossal duct becomes fluid filled it will form a thyroglossal duct cyst which accounts for 70 of congenital neck masses and is the most likely diagnosis if the mass is along the midline of the neck  these cysts are often diagnosed in children under the age of ten and have no particular gender prevalence the cysts are normally asymptomatic at this age and are noticed because of the swelling that will move if the patient swallows over 80 of these cysts are located at or below the hyoid bone  very rarely the persistent duct can become cancerous called thyroglossal duct carcinoma in the case of thyroglossal duct carcinoma the cancerous cells are ectopic thyroid tissue that has been deposited along the thyroglossal duct and will present as a papillary carcinoma  however the cells are less likely to metastasize in the cyst than if they were present in the actual thyroid gland the other fourth of abnormalities presents as draining abscess this is from an infection that will rupture through the skin to allow for adequate drainage of the infected area  ultrasound is the often chosen to examine the duct and determine the presence and size of any cysts or abnormalities fineneedle aspiration cytology can also be used to confirm the diagnosis  in order to prevent further cysts and infections from forming the thyroglossal duct and all of its branches are removed from the throat and neck area a procedure known as the sistrunk procedure is considered to be the standard procedure and involves removal of portions of the hyoid bone and core tissue of the suprahyoid region cysts will often reoccur if the entire duct is not removed so reoccurrence requires a wider range of tissue to be removed in a subsequent surgery  delaying the surgical procedure almost always leads to recurrent infections which will continue to delay the needed treatment the sistrunk procedure has a reoccurrence rate of less than 5 proving it is extremely effective at removing the majority of traces of the persistent thyroglossal duct

V annular pancreas is a rare condition in which the second part of the duodenum is surrounded by a ring of pancreatic tissue continuous with the head of the pancreas this portion of the pancreas can constrict the duodenum and block or impair the flow of food to the rest of the intestines it is estimated to occur in 1 out of 12000 to 15000 newborns  the ambiguity arises from the fact that not all cases are symptomatic    it is typically associated with abnormal embryological development however adult cases can develop it can result from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud forming a pancreatic ring it can also result if the ventral pancreatic bud fails to fully rotate so it remains on the right or if the dorsal bud rotates in the wrong direction such that the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue blockage of the duodenum develops if inflammation pancreatitis develops in the annular pancreas early signs of abnormality include polyhydramnios an excess of amniotic fluid low birth weight and feeding intolerance immediately after birth postnatal diagnostic procedures include abdominal xray and ultrasound ct scan and upper gi and small bowel series treatment usually is bypassing the obstructed segment of duodenum by duodenojejunostomy another approach is laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy

V exencephaly is a type of cephalic disorder wherein the brain is located outside of the skull this condition is usually found in embryos as an early stage of anencephaly as an exencephalic pregnancy progresses the neural tissue gradually degenerates the prognosis for infants born with exencephaly is extremely poor it is rare to find an infant born with exencephaly as most cases that are not early stages of anencephaly are usually stillborn those infants who are born with the condition usually die within hours or minutes    until recently the medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases that are now being found to be related as a result of new genetic research some of these are in fact highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorders exencephaly is one such disease that has recently been identified as part of an emerging class of diseases called cilopathies the underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell organelles which are present in many cellular types throughout the human body the cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multisymptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia bardetbiedl syndrome polycystic kidney and liver disease nephronophthisis alström syndrome meckelgruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration

V frontonasal dysplasia fnd also known as median cleft face syndrome frontonasal dysostosis frontonasal malformation or tessier cleft number 014 is a congenital malformation of the midface  for the diagnosis of fnd a patient should present at least two of the following characteristics hypertelorism an increased distance between the eyes a wide nasal root vertical midline cleft of the nose andor upper lip cleft of the wings of the nose malformed nasal tip encephalocele an opening of the skull with protrusion of the brain or vshaped hair pattern on the forehead  the cause of fnd remains unknown fnd seems to be sporadic random and multiple environmental factors are suggested as possible causes for the syndrome however in some families multiple cases of fnd were reported which suggests a genetic cause of fnd     midfacial malformations can be subdivided into two different groups one group with hypertelorism this includes fnd the other with hypotelorism a decreased distance between the eyes this includes holoprosencephaly failure of development of the forebrain  in addition a facial cleft can be classified using the tessier classification each of the clefts is numbered from 0 to 14 the 15 different types of clefts are then subdivided into 4 groups based on their anatomical position in the face  midline clefts paramedian clefts orbital clefts and lateral clefts fnd is a midline cleft classified as tessier 014 besides this the additional anomalies seen in fnd can be subdivided by region none of these anomalies are specific for the syndrome of fnd but they do occur more often in patients with fnd than in the population the anomalies that may be present are the clefts of the face that are present in fnd are vertical clefts these can differ in severity when they are less severe they often present with hypertelorism and normal brain development  mental retardation is more likely when the hypertelorism is more severe or when extracephalic anomalies occur    there are multiple classification systems for fnd none of these classification systems have unraveled any genetic factors as the cause of fnd yet all of them are very valuable in determining the prognosis of an individual in the subheadings below the most common classifications will be explained this is a classification based on the embryological etiology of fnd this classification is based on the morphologic characteristics of fnd that describes a variety of phenotypes both of these classifications are further described in table 1 this table originates from the article acromelic frontonasal dysplasia further delineation of a subtype with brain malformations and polydactyly toriello syndrome verloes et al the pai syndrome is a rare subtype of frontonasal dysplasia it is a triad of developmental defects of the face comprising midline cleft of the upper lip nasal and facial skin polyps and central nervous system lipomas when all the cases are compared a difference in severity of the midline cleft of the upper lip can be seen the mild form presents with just a gap between the upper teeth the severe group presents with a complete cleft of the upper lip and alveolar ridge  nervous system lipomas are rare congenital benign tumors of the central nervous system mostly located in the medial line and especially in the corpus callosum generally patients with these lipomas present with strokes however patients with the pai syndrome dont that is why it is suggested that isolated nervous system lipomas have a different embryological origin than the lipomas present in the pai syndrome the treatment of cns lipomas mainly consists of observation and follow up  skin lipomas occur relatively often in the normal population however facial and nasal lipomas are rare especially in childhood however the pai syndrome often present with facial and nasal polyps  these skin lipomas are benign and are therefore more a cosmetic problem than a functional problem the skin lipomas can develop on different parts of the face the most common place is the nose other common places are the forehead the conjunctivae and the frenulum linguae the amount of skin lipomas is not related to the severity of the midline clefting  patients with the pai syndrome have a normal neuropsychological development until today there is no known cause for the pai syndrome the large variety in phenotypes make the pai syndrome difficult to diagnose thus the incidence of pai syndrome seems to be underestimated  acromelic frontonasal dysplasia is a rare subtype of fnd it has an autosomal recessive inheritance acromelic frontonasal dysplasia is associated with central nervous system malformations and limb defects including a clubfoot an underdeveloped shinbone and preaxial polydactyly of the feet preaxial polydactyly is a condition in which there are too many toes on the side of the big toe  the phenotype of afnd is severe a type ia demyer and a sedano type d in contrast to the other subtypes of fnd afnd has a relatively high frequency of underlying malformations of the brain  frontorhiny is another subtype of fnd it consists of multiple characteristics patient are characterized by hypertelorism a wide nasal bridge a split nasal tip a broad columella strip of skin running from the tip of the nose to the upper lip widely separated narrow nostrils a long philtrum vertical groove on the upper lip and twosided nasal swellings  frontorhiny is one of the two subtypes of fnd where a genetic mutation has been determined the mutation has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern the syndrome is often seen in siblings and most of the time parents are carriers see genetics  craniofrontonasal dysplasia cfnd is a rare type of fnd with x linked inheritance multiple features are characteristic for cfnd such as craniosynostosis of the coronal sutures prematurely closed cranial sutures dry frizzy curled hair splitting of the nails and facial asymmetry there is a large variety in phenotype women present with a more severe phenotype than men females characteristically have fnd craniosynostosis and additional small malformations males are usually more mildly affected presenting with only hypertelorism the gene that causes cfnd is called efnb1 and is located on the x chromosome a hypothesis for the more severe outcome in females is based on xinactivation which leads to mosaicism as a result patients have less functional cells generating abnormal tissue boundaries termed cellular interference this process almost never occurs in males as they have less mutagenic material in their genes  efbn1 also has an important function in males  as the syndrome has an xlinked inheritance pattern there is no mantoman inheritance   see craniofrontonasal dysplasia for more information oafns is a combination of fnd and oculoauriculovertebral spectrum oavs  the diagnosis of oavs is based on the following facial characteristics microtia underdeveloped external ear preauricular tags facial asymmetry mandibular hypoplasia and epibulbar lipodermoids benign tumor of the eye which consists of adipose and fibrous tissue there still remains discussion about the classification and the minimal amount of characteristics when someone presents with fnd and the characteristics of oavs the diagnosis oafns may be made  as the incidence of oafns is unknown there are probably a lot of children with mild phenotypes that arent being diagnosed as being oafns  the etiology of oafns is unknown but there are some theories about the genesis autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested because of a case with two affected siblings   and a case with consanguineous parents  however another study shows that it is more plausible that oafns is sporadic  it is known that maternal diabetes plays a role in developing malformations of craniofacial structures and in oavs therefore it is suggested as an etiologic factor of oafns folate deficiency is also suggested as possible mechanism  lowdose ct protocols should be considered in diagnosing children with oafns  midline facial clefts are one of the symptoms in fnd these defects develop in the early stages of embryological development this is around the 19th to 21st day of pregnancy the cause of the defect is failure of the mesodermal migration the mesoderm is one of the germ layers a collection of cells that have the same embryological origin as a result of this failure a midline facial cleft is formed  another symptom of fnd is the vshaped hairline in the normal situation hair growth surrounding the eyes is inhibited however in fnd this suppression is prevented in the midline by the increased interocular distance this causes the socalled widows peak a vshaped hairline in fnd patients   very early in embryogenesis the face and neck develop this development continues until adolescence organs develop out of primordia tissue in its earliest recognizable stage of development the developmental processes of the face and jaw structures originate from different primordia   the formation of the frontonasal process is the result of a complex signaling system which begins with the synthesis of retinoic acid a vitamin a metabolite this is needed to set up the facial ectodermal zone this zone makes signaling molecules that stimulate the cell proliferation of the frontonasal process a midfacial defect will occur if this signaling pathway is disrupted it is suggested that the absence of this pathway will lead to the formation of a gap and that when the pathway is working too hard excessive tissue will be formed fnd consists of various nasal malformations that result from excessive tissue in the frontonasal process which results in hypertelorism and a broad nasal bridge between the 4th and 8th week of pregnancy the nasomedial and maxillary processes will fuse to form the upper lip and jaw a failure of the fusion between the maxillary and nasomedial processes results in a cleft lip a median cleft lip is the result of a failed fusion between the two nasomedial processes the palate is formed between the 6th and 10th week of pregnancy the primordia of the palate are the lateral palatine processes and median palatine processes a failure of the fusion between the median and lateral palatine processes results in a cleft palate  there is still some discussion on whether fnd is sporadic or genetic the majority of fnd cases are sporadic yet some studies describe families with multiple members with fnd   gene mutations are likely to play an important role in the etiology unfortunately the genetic cause for most types of fnd remains undetermined the cause of frontorhiny is a mutation in the alx3 gene alx3 is essential for normal facial development different mutations can occur in the alx3 gene but they all lead to the same effect severe or complete loss of protein functionality  the alx3 mutation never occurs in a person without frontorhiny  it is thought that acromelic frontonasal dysostosis occurs due to an abnormality in the sonic hedgehog ssh signaling pathway this pathway plays an important role in developing the midline central nervous systemcraniofrontofacial region and the limbs hence it is plausible that an error in the ssh pathway causes acromelic frontonasal dysostosis because this syndrome not only shows abnormalities in the midfacial region but also in the limbs and cns  the main diagnostic tools for evaluating fnd are xrays and ctscans of the skull these tools could display any possible intracranial pathology in fnd for example ct can be used to reveal widening of nasal bones diagnostics are mainly used before reconstructive surgery for proper planning and preparation  prenatally various features of fnd such as hypertelorism can be recognized using ultrasound techniques  however only three cases of fnd have been diagnosed based on a prenatal ultrasound  other conditions may also show symptoms of fnd for example there are other syndromes that also represent with hypertelorism furthermore disorders like an intracranial cyst can affect the frontonasal region which can lead to symptoms similar to fnd therefore other options should always be considered in the differential diagnosis  because newborns can breathe only through their nose the main goal of postnatal treatment is to establish a proper airway  primary surgical treatment of fnd can already be performed at the age of 6 months but most surgeons wait for the children to reach the age of 6 to 8 years this decision is made because then the neurocranium and orbits have developed to 90 of their eventual form furthermore the dental placement in the jaw has been finalized around this age   to correct the rather prominent hypertelorism wide nasal root and midline cleft in fnd a facial bipartition can be performed this surgery is preferred to periorbital boxosteotomy because deformities are corrected with a better aesthetic result  during the operation the orbits are disconnected from the skull and the base of the skull however they remain attached to the upper jaw part of the forehead in the centre of the face is removed median faciotomy in the process then the orbits are rotated internally to correct the hypertelorism often a new nasal bone will have to be interpositioned using a bone transplant complications of this procedure are bleeding meningitis cerebrospinal fluid leakage and blindness  structural nasal deformities are corrected during or shortly after the facial bipartition surgery in this procedure bone grafts are used to reconstruct the nasal bridge however a second procedure is often needed after the development of the nose has been finalized at the age of 14 years or even later secondary rhinoplasty is based mainly on a nasal augmentation since it has been proven better to add tissue to the nose than to remove tissue this is caused by the minimal capacity of contraction of the nasal skin after surgery  in rhinoplasty the use of autografts tissue from the same person as the surgery is performed on is preferred however this is often made impossible by the relative damage done by previous surgery in those cases bone tissue from the skull or the ribs is used however this may give rise to serious complications such as fractures resorption of the bone or a flattened nasofacial angle to prevent these complications an implant made out of alloplastic material could be considered implants take less surgery time are limitlessly available and may have more favorable characteristics than autografts however possible risks are rejection infection migration of the implant or unpredictable changes in the physical appearance in the long term at the age of skeletal maturity orthognathic surgery may be needed because of the often hypoplastic maxilla skeletal maturity is usually reached around the age of 13 to 16 orthognathic surgery engages in diagnosing and treating disorders of the face and teeth and jaw position

V true hermaphroditism is a medical term for an intersex condition in which an individual is born with ovarian and testicular tissue there may be an ovary underneath one testicle or the other but more commonly one or both gonads is an ovotestis containing both types of tissue although similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis the conditions can be distinguished histologically    the term derives from the latin hermaphroditus from ancientgreek \u1f11\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2hermaphroditos  which derives from hermaphroditos  \u1f11\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03d5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 the son of hermes and aphrodite in greek mythology according to ovid he fused with the nymph salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes  according to the earlier diodorus siculus he was born with a physical body combining both sexes  the word hermaphrodite entered the english lexicon in the late fourteenth century  this condition is very rare there are several ways in which this may occur there are no documented cases in which both types of gonadal tissue function encountered karyotypes are 47xxy 46xx46xy or 46xx47xxy and various degrees of mosaicism with one interesting case of an xy predominant 96 mosaic giving birth  although fertility is possible in true hermaphrodites as of 2010 there have been at least 11 reported cases of fertility in true hermaphrodite humans in scientific literature  there has yet to be a documented case where both gonadal tissues function contrary to rumors of hermaphrodites being able to impregnate themselves external genitalia are often ambiguous the degree depending mainly on the amount of testosterone produced by the testicular tissue between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation

V aphallia is a congenital malformation in which the phallus penis or clitoris is absent it is the female counterpart of penile agenesis and testicular agenesis  the word is derived from the greek a for not and phallos for penis it is classified as an intersex condition   it is a rare condition with only approximately 60 cases reported as of 1989  and 75 cases as of 2005  however due to the stigma of intersex conditions and the issues of keeping accurate statistics and records among doctors it is likely there are more cases than reported aphallia is of unknown causes it is not linked to deficient hormone amounts or action but rather to a failure of the fetal genital tubercle to form between 3 and 6 weeks after conception the urethra of an affected child opens on the perineum congenital anomalies like cryptorchidism renal agenesisdysplasia musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary anomalies are also common 50 cases hence evaluation of the patient for internal anomalies is mandatory although aphallia can occur in any body type it is considered a substantially more troublesome problem with those who have testes present and has in the past sometimes been considered justification for assigning and rearing a genetically male infant as a girl after the theory in the 1950s that gender as a social construct was purely nurture and so an individual child could be raised early on and into one gender or the other regardless of their genetics or brain chemistry intersex people generally advocate harshly against coercive genital reassignment however and encourage infants to be raised choosing their own gender identity the nurture theory has been largely abandoned and cases of trying to rear children this way have not proven to be successful transitions  in newborn period or infancy feminizing operations are recommended for treatment of penile agenesis but after 2 years as sexual identification of the patients has appeared it is advised to perform masculinizing operations in order not to disturb the child psychologically  recent advances in surgical phalloplasty techniques have provided additional options for those still interested in pursuing surgery   david reimer a born male child whose parents were advised by a psychologist to raise as a girl after a botched circumcision

V a thyroglossal cyst is a fibrous cyst that forms from a persistent thyroglossal duct thyroglossal cysts can be defined as an irregular neck mass or a lump which had developed from cells and tissues left over after the formation of the thyroid gland during developmental stages  thyroglossal cysts are the most common cause of midline neck masses and are generally located substandard to the hyoid bone yet these neck masses can occur anywhere along the path of the thyroid gland from the base of the tongue to the suprasternal notch  other common causes of midline neck masses include lymphadenopathy dermoid cysts and various odontogenic anomalies  thryoglossal cyst are developed at birth and can have many diagnosis procedures to establish the degree of the cyst also complications can come along with the before and after masses of the thyroglossal cysts treatments are available to help with pain and reduction of the cyst   it usually presents as a midline neck lump in the region of the hyoid bone that is usually painless smooth and cystic though if infected pain can occur there may be difficulty breathing dysphagia difficulty swallowing or dyspepsia discomfort in the upper abdomen especially if the lump becomes large the most common location for a thyroglossal cyst is midline or slightly off midline between the isthmus of the thyroid and the hyoid bone or just above the hyoid bone a thyroglossal cyst can develop anywhere along a thyroglossal duct though cysts within the tongue or in the floor of the mouth are rare a thyroglossal cyst will move upwards with protrusion of the tongue thyroglossal cysts are associated with an increased incidence of ectopic thyroid tissue occasionally a lingual thyroid can be seen as a flattened strawberrylike lump at the base of the tongue  thyroglossal duct cysts are developed as a birth defect during the embryonic development the thyroid gland is being formed beginning at the base of the tongue moving towards the neck canal known as the thyroglossal duct once the thyroid reaches its final position in the neck the duct normally disappears yet in some cases portions of the duct remain behind leaving small pockets known as cysts during a persons life these cyst pockets can fill with fluids and mucus enlarging when infected presenting the thyroglossal cyst  the thyroglossal tract arises from the foramen cecum at the junction of the anterior twothirds and posterior onethird of the tongue any part of the tract can persist causing a sinus fistula or cyst most fistulae are acquired following rupture or incision of the infected thyroglossal cyst a thyroglossal cyst is lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium while a thyroglossal fistula is lined by columnar epithelium the diagnosis of a thyroglossal duct cyst needs to be examined by medical professions and is usually done by a physical exam it is important to identify whether or not the thyroglossal cyst contains any thyroid tissue as it can define the degree of cyst that is being dealt with  diagnosis procedures for a thyroglossal cyst include  thyroglossal duct cysts most often present with a palpable asymptomatic midline neck mass below the level of the hyoid bone the mass on the neck moves during swallowing or on protrusion of the tongue because of its attachment to the tongue via the tract of thyroid descent some patients will have neck or throat pain or dysphagia the persistent duct or sinus can promote oral secretions which may cause cysts to become infected up to half of thyroglossal cysts are not diagnosed until adult life the tract can lie dormant for years or even decades until some kind of stimulus leads to cystic dilation infection can sometimes cause the transient appearance of a mass or enlargement of the cyst at times with periodic recurrences spontaneous drainage may also occur differential diagnosis are ectopic thyroid enlarged lymph nodes dermoid cysts and goiter clinical features can be found in the subhyoid portion of the tract and 75 present as midline swellings the remainder can be found as far lateral as lateral tip of the hyoid bone typically the cyst will move upwards on protrusion of the tongue given its attachment to the embryonic duct as well as on swallowing because of attachment of the tract to the foramen caecum an infected thyroglossal duct cyst can occur when it is left untreated for a certain amount of time or simply when a thyroglossal duct cyst hasnt been suspected by a person the degree of infection can be examined as major rim enhancement has occurred located inferior to the hyoid bone also soft tissue swelling occurs along with airway obstruction and trouble swallowing due to the rapid enlargement of the cyst  with infections there can be rare cases where an expression of fluid is projected into the pharynx causing other problems within the neck  infections can occur before and after the removal of the thyrglossal duct cyst the infections that occur after the removal of the cyst include skin reactions including shiny skin redness and dryness from stitching and the healing process of the skin being exposed to other bacterias with a thyroglossal duct cysts ruptures can occur unexpectedly resulting draining sinuses known as thyroglossal fistula  thyroglossal fistula can develop when the removal of the cyst has not been fully completed this is usually noticed when bleeding in the neck occurs causing swelling and fluid ejection around the original wound of removal breathing and swallowing problems can also be of occurrence due to pressure within the neck  in rare cases of thyroglossal cysts cancer can be presented it is a very uncommon and the management for it can be seen as controversial when thyroglossal carcinoma occurs they are presented with a tumor which usually arises from the ectopic thyroid tissue within the cyst  this can result in the surgical removal of the lymph nodes and thyroid gland to stop any spreading of cancer to the rest of the body  treatment for a thyroglossal cyst is called the sistrunk procedure surgical resection of the duct to the base of the tongue and removal of the central portion of the hyoid bone although generally benign the cyst will be removed if the patient exhibits difficulty in breathing or swallowing or if the cyst is infected even if these symptoms are not present the cyst may be removed to eliminate the chance of infection or development of a carcinoma  or for cosmetic reasons if there is unsightly protrusion from the neck the sistrunk procedure involves excision not only of the cyst but also of the paths tract and branches a removal of the central portion of the hyoid bone is indicated to ensure complete removal of the tract it is unlikely that there will be a recurrence after such an operation the original sistrunk paper is available online with a modern commentary  at times antibiotics can be indicated if there is sign of infection thyroid scans and thyroid function studies are ordered preoperatively this is important to demonstrate that normally functioning thyroid tissue is in its usual area

V   morm syndrome is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder  this means that the disorder is present from birth and is likely the result of both healthy parents passing on a defective gene associated with morm syndrome to their offspring the disorder is not dependent on sex of the offspring both male and female offspring are equally likely to inherit the disorder the term morm is used to describe the characteristics associated with the disorder which include mental retardation truncal obesity retinal dystrophy and micropenis  the disorder shares similar characteristics with bardetbiedl syndrome and cohen syndrome both of which are autosomal recessive genetic disorders   morm syndrome can be distinguished from the above disorders because symptoms appear at a young age  the syndrome is caused by a mutation in the inpp5e gene which can be located on chromosome 9 in humans  further mapping resulted in the identification of a morm syndrome locus on chromosome 9q343 between the genetic markers d9s158 and d9s905  for individuals with morm syndrome symptoms do not appear until about one year into the childs life span  from conception to birth individuals with morm syndrome appear asymptotic with no abnormal characteristics  vision is negatively affected within the first year of life particularly night vision  individuals with morm syndrome experience decreased visual acuity meaning their ability to see distinct sharp lines decreases   vision quality continues to deteriorate until age three  any further reduction in vision acuity is not observed until the individual is between the ages thirty to forty  delayed sentence processing and intellectual disability is associated with individuals with morm syndrome primarily observed at age four  individuals continue to develop and grow until they are five to twelve years old during this age bracket truncal obesity can develop  truncal obesity is a term used to describe the build up of fat around ones trunk or torso as opposed to the persons extremities  males enter puberty at around age twelve and develop normally except for their sex organ the males penis will remain at the prepubescent size resulting in a micropenis  the life span of individuals with morm syndrome is unclear as well as the fertility of these individuals  morm syndrome is a genetic disorder obtained through inheritance  the main method for testing individuals showing symptoms of morm syndrome is sequence analysis of the entire coding region  when performing a sequence analysis of the entire coding region the gene innp5e is targeted  sequence analysis is the biotechnological process in which the structure and sequence of dna rna or protein sequence is determined through the use of technology the sequence can then be analyzed to determine mutations or abnormalities in that particular region when testing for morm syndrome sequence analysis of the region of the genome which contains the gene inpp5e is targeted and examined to look for mutations  morm syndrome is associated with the gene inpp5e  inpp5e is a gene whos function is not well understood  it is hypothesized to play a role in primary cilia stability  a homozygous mutation in the inpp5e gene on chromosome 9q34 is the cause for morm syndrome  the mutation causes a homozygous transition in the last exon of the inpp5e gene  this transition results in the dna bases changing from a cytosine residue to a thymine residue  the resulting protein will then have an altered amino acid sequence in unaffected individuals this specific codon region of dna bases is supposed to code for the amino acid glutamine  in cases of morm syndrome this codon codes for a termination sequence which prematurely stops the production of the protein  in unaffected individuals the protein is evenly disbursed throughout the ciliia axoneme which allows for the cilia to be stable  cilia are antenna like structures which protrude from the extracellular surface of the cell  the cilia allows for extracellular signallingcommunication between cells and their environment  when the inpp5e gene is mutated the protein is damaged and is unable to spread out along the cilia axoneme and is unable to interact with other stabilizing proteins  this results is morm syndrome individuals being unable to stabilize their cilia axoneme  it is still not well understood the exact mechanism as to how the mutation in the innp5e gene causes cilia instability

V congenital diaphragmatic hernia cdh is a congenital malformation birth defect of the diaphragm the most common type of cdh is a bochdalek hernia other types include morgagni hernia diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity hindering proper lung formation cdh is a lifethreatening pathology in infants and a major cause of death due to two complications pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension  experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions with some focusing on hypoplasia others on hypertension  newborns with cdh often have severe respiratory distress which can be lifethreatening unless treated appropriately   the bochdalek hernia also known as a posterolateral diaphragmatic hernia is the most common manifestation of cdh accounting for more than 95 of cases in this instance the diaphragm abnormality is characterized by a hole in the posterolateral corner of the diaphragm which allows passage of the abdominal viscera into the chest cavity the majority of bochdalek hernias 8085 occur on the left side of the diaphragm a large proportion of the remaining cases occur on the right side to date it carries a high mortality and an active area of clinical research this rare anterior defect of the diaphragm is variably referred to as morgagni retrosternal or parasternal hernia accounting for approximately 2 of all cdh cases it is characterized by herniation through the foramina of morgagni which are located immediately adjacent and posterior to the xiphoid process of the sternum  the diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic eventration is used when there is abnormal displacement ie elevation of part or all of an otherwise intact diaphragm into the chest cavity this rare type of cdh occurs because in the region of eventration the diaphragm is thinner allowing the abdominal viscera to protrude upwards it involves three major defects congenital diaphragmatic hernia has a mortality rate of 4062  outcomes being more favorable in the absence of other congenital abnormalities individual rates vary greatly dependent upon multiple factors size of hernia organs involved additional birth defects or genetic problems amount of lung growth age and size at birth type of treatments timing of treatments complications such as infections and lack of lung function this condition can often be diagnosed before birth and fetal intervention can sometimes help depending on the severity of the condition  infants born with diaphragmatic hernia experience respiratory failure due to both pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia the first condition is a restriction of blood flow through the lungs thought to be caused by defects in the lung pulmonary hypoplasia or decreased lung volume is directly related to the abdominal organs presence in the chest cavity which causes the lungs to be severely undersized especially on the side of the hernia survival rates for infants with this condition vary but have generally been increasing through advances in neonatal medicine work has been done to correlate survival rates to ultrasound measurements of the lung volume as compared to the babys head circumference this figure known as the lung to head ratio lhr a small percentage of cases go unrecognized into adulthood  first step in management is orogastric tube placement and securing the airway intubation the baby will usually be immediately placed on a ventilator extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo has been used as part of the treatment strategy at some hospitals   ecmo acts as a baby heartlung bypass though it can be used for older children as well a cannula is inserted into the carotid artery allowing the blood to exit the body and begin its trek through the ecmo circuit it is then scrubbed oxygenated and passes through a filter before being returned to the body via a second cannula into the babys own circulatory system where it makes its rounds before returning to the ecmo circuit to be oxygenated again in essence the ecmo circuit acts as the babys lungs babies require extra blood volume and hefty doses of blood thinners in order to keep the circuit running without clot formation which could be potentially fatal even though the baby is not using her lungs an ocillating ventilator maybe still be used to keep some air in the lungs so that they do not fully collapse while not being used during ecmo the pulmonary artery has a chance to rest as it were thus hopefully reducing the presence of pulmonary hypertension one of the biggest complication of cdh cases cdh repair can be done while the baby is on ecmo although blood thinners increase the risk of bleeding complications usually surgeons prefer to perform cdh repairs off ecmo once the baby is taken off ecmo the carotid artery is sealed and can no longer be used when repairing the hernia an incision is made in the abdomen the hernia can sometimes be simply stitched closed but in more complicated cases a patch may be required a synthetic patch can be used but will usually require replacement later as the child grows a more natural patch can be created by slicing and folding over a section of abdominal muscle and securing it to the exsiting piece of diaphragm any organ displacement is corrected during surgery though the heart and lungs will usually move back into position on their own once displaced organs such as bowel liver or stomach are out of the way the incision is then closed sometimes the incision site will be left open to allow the body to adjust to newly moved organs and the pressure associated with that and then closed later once swelling and drainage has decreased  diaphragm eventration is typically repaired thoracoscopically by a technique called plication of the diaphragm  plication basically involves a folding of the eventrated diaphragm which is then sutured in order to take up the slack of the excess diaphragm tissue

V arsenic is a chemical element with symbolas and atomic number33 arsenic occurs in many minerals usually in conjunction with sulfur and metals and also as a pure elemental crystal arsenic is a metalloid it can exist in various allotropes although only the gray form has important use in industry the main use of metallic arsenic is for strengthening alloys of copper and especially lead for example in car batteries arsenic is a common ntype dopant in semiconductor electronic devices and the optoelectronic compound gallium arsenide is the most common semiconductor in use after doped silicon arsenic and its compounds especially the trioxide are used in the production of pesticides treated wood products herbicides and insecticides these applications are declining however  a few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites trace quantities of arsenic are an essential dietary element in rats hamsters goats chickens and presumably many other species including humans however arsenic poisoning occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed arsenic contamination of groundwater is a problem that affects millions of people across the world   the three most common arsenic allotropes are metallic gray yellow and black arsenic with gray being the most common  gray arsenic \u03b1as space group r3m no 166 adopts a doublelayered structure consisting of many interlocked ruffled sixmembered rings because of weak bonding between the layers gray arsenic is brittle and has a relatively low mohs hardness of 35 nearest and nextnearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex with the three atoms in the same doublelayer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next  this relatively close packing leads to a high density of 573gcm   gray arsenic is a semimetal but becomes a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1214 ev if amorphized  gray arsenic is also the most stable form yellow arsenic is soft and waxy and somewhat similar to tetraphosphorus p4 both have four atoms arranged in a tetrahedral structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond this unstable allotrope being molecular is the most volatile least dense and most toxic solid yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapor as4 it is rapidly transformed into gray arsenic by light the yellow form has a density of 197 gcm   black arsenic is similar in structure to red phosphorus  black arsenic can also be formed by cooling vapor at around 100220c it is glassy and brittle it is also a poor electrical conductor  arsenic occurs in nature as a monoisotopic element composed of one stable isotope  as  as of 2003 at least 33 radioisotopes have also been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from 60 to 92 the most stable of these is  as with a halflife of 8030days all other isotopes have halflives of under one day with the exception of  as t126530 hours  as t12260 hours  as t121777 days  as t1210942 days and  as t123883 hours isotopes that are lighter than the stable  as tend to decay by \u03b2  decay and those that are heavier tend to decay by \u03b2  decay with some exceptions at least 10 nuclear isomers have been described ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84 the most stable of arsenics isomers is  as with a halflife of 111seconds  when heated in air arsenic oxidizes to arsenic trioxide the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling garlic this odor can be detected on striking arsenide minerals such as arsenopyrite with a hammer arsenic and some arsenic compounds sublimes upon heating at atmospheric pressure converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at 887k 614c  the triple point is 363mpa and 1090k 820c   arsenic makes arsenic acid with concentrated nitric acid arsenious acid with dilute nitric acid and arsenic trioxide with concentrated sulfuric acid  arsenic compounds resemble in some respects those of phosphorus which occupies the same group column of the periodic table arsenic is less commonly observed in the pentavalent state however the most common oxidation states for arsenic are 3 in the arsenides such as alloylike intermetallic compounds 3 in the arsenites and 5 in the arsenates and most organoarsenic compounds arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square as34 ions in the mineral skutterudite  in the 3 oxidation state arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the lone pair of electrons  arsenic forms colorless odorless crystalline oxides as2o3 white arsenic and as2o5 which are hygroscopic and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions arsenicv acid is a weak acid its salts are called arsenates which are the basis of arsenic contamination of groundwater a problem that affects many people synthetic arsenates include paris green copperii acetoarsenite calcium arsenate and lead hydrogen arsenate these three have been used as agricultural insecticides and poisons the protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between phosphate and phosphoric acid unlike phosphorous acid arsenous acid is genuinely tribasic with the formula asoh3 a broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known orpiment as2s3 and realgar as4s4 are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments in as4s10 arsenic has a formal oxidation state of 2 in as4s4 which features asas bonds so that the total covalency of as is still 3  all trihalides of arseniciii are well known except the astatide which is unknown arsenic pentafluoride asf5 is the only important pentahalide reflecting the lower stability of the 5 oxidation state pentachloride is stable only below 50c  arsenic is used as the group 5 element in the iiiv semiconductors gallium arsenide indium arsenide and aluminium arsenide  the valence electron count of gaas is the same as a pair of si atoms but the band structure is completely different which results distinct bulk properties  other arsenic alloys include the iiv semiconductor cadmium arsenide  a large variety of organoarsenic compounds are known several were developed as chemical warfare agents during world war i including vesicants such as lewisite and vomiting agents such as adamsite    cacodylic acid which is of historic and practical interest arises from the methylation of arsenic trioxide a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry arsenic makes up about 15ppm000015 of the earths crust making it the 53rd most abundant element soil contains 110ppm of arsenic seawater has only 16ppb arsenic  minerals with the formula mass and mas2 m  fe ni co are the dominant commercial sources of arsenic together with realgar an arsenic sulfide mineral and native arsenic an illustrative mineral is arsenopyrite feass which is structurally related to iron pyrite many minor ascontaining minerals are known arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment  in 2005 china was the top producer of white arsenic with almost 50 world share followed by chile peru and morocco according to the british geological survey and the united states geological survey  most operations in the us and europe have closed for environmental reasons the arsenic is recovered mainly as a side product from the purification of copper arsenic is part of the smelter dust from copper gold and lead smelters  on roasting in air of arsenopyrite arsenic sublimes as arseniciii oxide leaving iron oxides  while roasting without air results in the production of metallic arsenic further purification from sulfur and other chalcogens is achieved by sublimation in vacuum or in a hydrogen atmosphere or by distillation from molten leadarsenic mixture  the word arsenic has its origin in the syriac word \u0720\u0710 \u0719\u0710\u0726\u0722\u071d\u0710 al zarniqa  from the persian word \u0632\u0631\u0646\u064a\u062e zarnikh meaning yellow literally goldcolored and hence yellow orpiment it was adopted into greek as arsenikon \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd a form that is folk etymology being the neuter form of the greek word arsenikos \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 meaning male virile the greek word was adopted in latin as arsenicum which in french became arsenic from which the english word arsenic is taken  arsenic sulfides orpiment realgar and oxides have been known and used since ancient times  zosimos circa 300 ad describes roasting sandarach realgar to obtain cloud of arsenic arsenic trioxide which he then reduces to metallic arsenic  as the symptoms of arsenic poisoning were somewhat illdefined it was frequently used for murder until the advent of the marsh test a sensitive chemical test for its presence another less sensitive but more general test is the reinsch test owing to its use by the ruling class to murder one another and its potency and discreetness arsenic has been called the poison of kings and the king of poisons  during the bronze age arsenic was often included in bronze which made the alloy harder socalled arsenical bronze   albertus magnus albert the great 11931280 is believed to have been the first to isolate the element from a compound in 1250 by heating soap together with arsenic trisulfide  in 1649 johann schröder published two ways of preparing arsenic  crystals of elemental native arsenic are found in nature although rare cadets fuming liquid impure cacodyl often claimed as the first synthetic organometallic compound was synthesized in 1760 by louis claude cadet de gassicourt by the reaction of potassium acetate with arsenic trioxide  in the victorian era arsenic white arsenic or arsenic trioxide was mixed with vinegar and chalk and eaten by women to improve the complexion of their faces making their skin paler to show they did not work in the fields arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to improve their complexion the accidental use of arsenic in the adulteration of foodstuffs led to the bradford sweet poisoning in 1858 which resulted in around 20 deaths  two pigments based on arsenic have been widely used since their discovery  paris green and scheeles green after arsenics toxicity became widely known they were less often used as pigments so these compounds were more often used as insecticides in the 1860s an arsenic byproduct of dye production london purple  a solid consisting of a mixture of arsenic trioxide aniline lime and ferrous oxide which is insoluble in water and very toxic by inhalation and ingestion   was widely used but paris green another arsenicbased dye was later substituted for it  with better understanding of the toxicology mechanism two other compounds were used starting in the 1890s  arsenite of lime and arsenate of lead were used widely as insecticides until the discovery of ddt in 1942    the toxicity of arsenic to insects bacteria and fungi led to its use as a wood preservative  in the 1950s a process of treating wood with chromated copper arsenate also known as cca or tanalith was invented and for decades this treatment was the most extensive industrial use of arsenic an increased appreciation of the toxicity of arsenic resulted in a ban for the use of cca in consumer products the european union and united states initiated this process in 2004   cca remains in heavy use in other countries however eg malaysian rubber plantations  arsenic was also used in various agricultural insecticides and poisons for example lead hydrogen arsenate was a common insecticide on fruit trees  but contact with the compound sometimes resulted in brain damage among those working the sprayers in the second half of the 20th century monosodium methyl arsenate msma and disodium methyl arsenate dsma  less toxic organic forms of arsenic  have replaced lead arsenate in agriculture with the exception of cotton farming the use of the organic arsenicals was phased out until 2013  arsenic is used as a feed additive in poultry and swine production in particular in the us to increase weight gain improve feed efficiency and to prevent disease   an example is roxarsone which had been used as a broiler starter by about 70 of us broiler growers  the poisonfree poultry act of 2009 proposed to ban the use of roxarsone in industrial swine and poultry production  alpharma a subsidiary of pfizer inc which produces roxarsone voluntarily suspended sales of the drug in response to studies showing elevated levels of inorganic arsenic a carcinogen in treated chickens  a successor to alpharma zoetis continues to sell nitarsone primarily for use in turkeys  arsenic is intentionally added to the feed of chickens raised for human consumption organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than pure arsenic and promote the growth of chickens under some conditions the arsenic in chicken feed can end up getting converted back to its toxic inorganic form   during the 18th 19th and 20th centuries a number of arsenic compounds were used as medicines including arsphenamine by paul ehrlich and arsenic trioxide by thomas fowler  arsphenamine as well as neosalvarsan was indicated for syphilis and trypanosomiasis but has been superseded by modern antibiotics arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 500 years most commonly in the treatment of cancer but in medications as diverse as fowlers solution in psoriasis  the us food and drug administration in the year 2000 approved this compound for the treatment of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia that is resistant to alltrans retinoic acid  recently new research has been done in locating tumors using arsenic74 a positron emitter the advantages of using this isotope instead of the previously used iodine124 is that the signal in the pet scan is clearer as the body tends to transport iodine to the thyroid gland producing signal noise  in subtoxic doses soluble arsenic compounds act as stimulants and were once popular in small doses as medicine by people in the mid18th to 19th centuries  the main use of metallic arsenic is in alloying with lead lead components in car batteries are strengthened by the presence of a very small percentage of arsenic   dezincification can be strongly reduced by adding arsenic to brass a copperzinc alloy  phosphorus deoxidized arsenical copper with an arsenic content of 03 has an increased corrosion stability in certain environments  gallium arsenide is an important semiconductor material used in integrated circuits circuits made from gaas are much faster but also much more expensive than those made in silicon unlike silicon it has a direct bandgap so can be used in laser diodes and leds to directly convert electricity into light  after world war i the united states built up a stockpile of 20000 tonnes of lewisite clchchascl2 a chemical weapon that is a vesicant blister agent and lung irritant the stockpile was neutralized with bleach and dumped into the gulf of mexico after the 1950s  during the vietnam war the united states used agent blue a mixture of sodium cacodylate and its acid form as one of the rainbow herbicides to deprive north vietnamese soldiers of foliage cover and rice   some species of bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenate to arsenite under oxidative environmental conditions some bacteria use arsenite which is oxidized to arsenate as fuel for their metabolism  the enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases arr  in 2008 bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis in the absence of oxygen with arsenites as electron donors producing arsenates just as ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor producing molecular oxygen researchers conjecture that over the course of history these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenatereducing bacteria to thrive one strain phs1 has been isolated and is related to the gammaproteobacterium ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii the mechanism is unknown but an encoded arr enzyme may function in reverse to its known homologues  although the arsenate and phosphate anions are similar structurally no evidence exists for the replacement of phosphate in atp or nucleic acids by arsenic   there is evidence for the essentiality of arsenic as a trace mineral in birds chickens and in mammals rats hamsters and goats however the biological mechanism for its essential function is not known  arsenic has been linked to epigenetic changes heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in dna sequence these include dna methylation histone modification and rna interference toxic levels of arsenic cause significant dna hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes p16 and p53 thus increasing risk of carcinogenesis these epigenetic events have been studied in vitro using human kidney cells and in vivo using rat liver cells and peripheral blood leukocytes in humans  inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and its other bases involved in epigenetic modification of dna  studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor will help in developing precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility the chinese brake fern pteris vittata hyperaccumulates arsenic present in the soil into its leaves and has a proposed use in phytoremediation  inorganic arsenic and its compounds upon entering the food chain are progressively metabolized through a process of methylation   for example the mold scopulariopsis brevicaulis produces significant amounts of trimethylarsine if inorganic arsenic is present  the organic compound arsenobetaine is found in some marine foods such as fish and algae and also in mushrooms in larger concentrations the average persons intake is about 1050µgday values about 1000µg are not unusual following consumption of fish or mushrooms but there is little danger in eating fish because this arsenic compound is nearly nontoxic  other naturally occurring pathways of exposure include volcanic ash weathering of arseniccontaining minerals and ores and dissolved in groundwater it is also found in food water soil and air  arsenic is absorbed by all plants but is more concentrated in leafy vegetables rice apple and grape juice and seafood  an additional route of exposure is through inhalation  extensive arsenic contamination of groundwater has led to widespread arsenic poisoning in bangladesh  and neighboring countries it is estimated that approximately 57million people in the bengal basin are drinking groundwater with arsenic concentrations elevated above the world health organizations standard of 10 parts per billion ppb  however a study of cancer rates in taiwan  suggested that significant increases in cancer mortality appear only at levels above 150 ppb the arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin and is released from the sediment into the groundwater owing to the anoxic conditions of the subsurface this groundwater began to be used after local and western ngos and the bangladeshi government undertook a massive shallow tube well drinkingwater program in the late twentieth century this program was designed to prevent drinking of bacteriacontaminated surface waters but failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater many other countries and districts in southeast asia such as vietnam and cambodia have geological environments conducive to generation of higharsenic groundwaters arsenicosis was reported in nakhon si thammarat thailand in 1987 and the chao phraya river is suspected of containing high levels of naturally occurring dissolved arsenic but has not been a public health problem owing to the use of bottled water  in the united states arsenic is most commonly found in the ground waters of the southwest  parts of new england michigan wisconsin minnesota and the dakotas are also known to have significant concentrations of arsenic in ground water  increased levels of skin cancer have been associated with arsenic exposure in wisconsin even at levels below the 10 part per billion drinking water standard  according to a recent film funded by the us superfund millions of private wells have unknown arsenic levels and in some areas of the us over 20 of wells may contain levels that exceed established limits  lowlevel exposure to arsenic at concentrations of 100 parts per billion ie above the 10 parts per billion drinking water standard compromises the initial immune response to h1n1 or swine flu infection according to niehssupported scientists the study conducted in laboratory mice suggests that people exposed to arsenic in their drinking water may be at increased risk for more serious illness or death in response to infection from the virus  some canadians are drinking water that contains inorganic arsenic private dug well waters are most at risk for containing inorganic arsenic preliminary well water analyses typically does not test for arsenic researchers at the geological survey of canada have modelled relative variation in natural arsenic hazard potential for the province of new brunswick this study has important implications for potable water and health concerns relating to inorganic arsenic  epidemiological evidence from chile shows a dosedependent connection between chronic arsenic exposure and various forms of cancer in particular when other risk factors such as cigarette smoking are present these effects have been demonstrated to persist below 50 ppb  analyzing multiple epidemiological studies on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests a small but measurable risk increase for bladder cancer at 10 ppb  according to peter ravenscroft of the department of geography at the university of cambridge  roughly 80 million people worldwide consume between 10 and 50 ppb arsenic in their drinking water if they all consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2000 cases of bladder cancer alone this represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact since it does not include lung or skin cancer and explicitly underestimates the exposure those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current who standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation early 1973 evaluations of the removal of dissolved arsenic by drinking water treatment processes demonstrated that arsenic is very effectively removed by coprecipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides the use of iron as a coagulant in particular was found to remove arsenic with efficiencies exceeding 90   several adsorptive media systems have been approved for pointofservice use in a study funded by the united states environmental protection agency us epa and the national science foundation nsf a team of european and indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in west bengal based on insitu remediation method sar technology this technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left as an insoluble form 5 state in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and thus developing an oxidation zone to support arsenic oxidizing microorganisms this process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap  another effective and inexpensive method to remove arsenic from contaminated well water is to sink wells 500feet or deeper to reach purer waters a recent 2011 study funded by the us national institute of environmental health sciences superfund research program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and take it out of circulation through this process called adsorption in which arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles arsenic can be naturally removed from well water  magnetic separations of arsenic at very low magnetic field gradients have been demonstrated in pointofuse water purification with highsurfacearea and monodisperse magnetite fe3o4 nanocrystals using the high specific surface area of fe3o4 nanocrystals the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water has been dramatically reduced  epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of all leading causes of mortality  the literature provides reason to believe arsenic exposure is causative in the pathogenesis of diabetes  hungarian engineer lászló schremmer has recently discovered that by the use of chaffbased filters it is possible to reduce the arsenic content of water to 3µgl this is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground aquifer  for several centuries the people of san pedro de atacama in chile have been drinking water that is contaminated with arsenic and it is believed that they may have developed some immunity to the ill effects of consuming it    arsenic is unique among the trace metalloids and oxyanionforming trace metals eg as se sb mo v cr u re it is sensitive to mobilization at ph values typical of natural waters ph 6585 under both oxidizing and reducing conditions arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states 3 0 3 and 5 but in natural waters it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite asiii or pentavalent arsenate asv organic forms of as are produced by biological activity mostly in surface waters but are rarely quantitatively important organic as compounds may however occur where waters are signi\ufb01cantly impacted by industrial pollution  arsenic may be solubilized by various processes when ph is high arsenic may be released from surface binding sites that lose their positive charge when water levels drops and sulfide minerals are exposed to air arsenic trapped in sulfide minerals can be released into water when organic carbon is present in water bacteria are fed by directly reducing asv to asiii or by reducing the element at the binding site attached there and releases arsenic  the aquatic transformations of as are affected by ph reductionoxidation potential organic matter concentration and the concentrations and forms of other elements especially iron and manganese the main factors are ph and the redox potential generally the main forms of as under oxic conditions are h3aso4 h2aso4  haso4  and aso4  at ph 2 27 711 and 11 respectively under reducing conditions h3aso4 is predominant at ph 29  the oxidation and reduction of arsenic affect its ability to migrate in subsurface environments arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate which is less mobile than arsenite is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral ph therefore arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions the reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds as a result the adsorption of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater that is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments  the presence of sulfur is another factor that affects the transformation of arsenic in natural water arsenic can precipitate when metal sulfides form in this way arsenic is removed from the water and its mobility decreases when oxygenis present bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur to generate energypotentially releasing bound arsenic redox reactions involving fe also appear to be essential factors in the fate of arsenic in aquatic systems the reduction of iron oxyhydroxides plays a key role in the release of as to water so as can be enriched in water with elevated fe concentrations  under oxidizing conditions arsenic can be mobilized from pyrite or iron oxides especially at elevated ph under reducing conditions arsenic can be mobilized by reductive desorption or dissolution when associated with iron oxides the reductive desorption occurs under two circumstances one is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly the other results from a change in the charge on the mineral surface which leads to the desorption of bound arsenic  some species of bacteria catalyze redox transformations of arsenic dissimilatory arsenaterespiring prokaryotes darp speed up the reduction of asv to asiii darp use asv as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process chemoautotrophic arsenite oxidizers cao and heterotrophic arsenite oxidizers hao convert asiii into asv cao combine the oxidation of asiii with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate they use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from co2 hao cannot obtain energy from asiii oxidation this process may be an arsenic detoxification mechanism for the bacteria  equilibrium thermodynamic calculations predict that asv concentrations should be greater than asiii concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions ie where so4  reduction is occurring however abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow oxidation of asiii by dissolved o2 is a particularly slow reaction for example johnson and pilson 1975 gave halflives for the oxygenation of asiii in seawater ranging from several months to a year  in other studies asvasiii ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates cherry found from experimental studies that the asvasiii ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to 3 weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales  sterile water samples have been observed to be less susceptible to speciation changes than nonsterile samples  oremland found that the reduction of asv to asiii in mono lake was rapidly catalyzed by bacteria with rate constants ranging from 002 to 03 day   as of 2002 usbased industries consumed 19600 metric tons of arsenic ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with chromated copper arsenate cca in 2007 50 of the 5280 metric tons of consumption was still used for this purpose   in the united states the voluntary phasingout of arsenic in production of consumer products and residential and general consumer construction products began on 31 december 2003 and alternative chemicals are now used such as alkaline copper quaternary borates copper azole cyproconazole and propiconazole  although discontinued this application is also one of the most concern to the general public the vast majority of older pressuretreated wood was treated with cca cca lumber is still in widespread use in many countries and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor building material although the use of cca lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding soil from playground equipment for instance a risk is also presented by the burning of older cca timber the direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt cca lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans the lethal human dose is approximately 20grams of ash  scrap cca lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires protocols for safe disposal of cca lumber do not exist evenly throughout the world there is also concern in some quarters about the widespread landfill disposal of such timber one tool that maps releases of arsenic to particular locations in the united states  and also provides additional information about such releases is toxmap toxmap is a geographic information system gis from the division of specialized information services of the united states national library of medicine nlm that uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agencys epa toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs toxmap is a resource funded by the us federal government toxmaps chemical and environmental health information is taken from nlms toxicology data network toxnet  and pubmed and from other authoritative sources physical chemical and biological methods have been used to decrease the concentration of arsenic in contaminated water  among these methods bioremediation has been suggested to be cost effective and environmentally friendly  bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite the toxic form of arsenic to humans to arsenate arsenate 5 oxidation state is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water while arsenite 3 oxidation state is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor  this is a useful method in ground water remediation another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via phytoremediation but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered in order to choose a suitable bioremediation approach for a site its environmental conditions needs to be evaluated some sites may require the addition of an electron acceptor while others require added microbes bioaugmentation regardless of the method used constant monitoring is required to prevent future contamination arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as toxic and dangerous for the environment in the european union under directive 67548eec the international agency for research on cancer iarc recognizes arsenic and arsenic compounds as group 1 carcinogens and the eu lists arsenic trioxide arsenic pentoxide and arsenate salts as category 1 carcinogens arsenic is known to cause arsenicosis owing to its manifestation in drinking water the most common species being arsenate haso24 asv and arsenite h3aso3 asiii in the united states since 2006 the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the environmental protection agency epa is 10 ppb  and the fda set the same standard in 2005 for bottled water    the department of environmental protection for new jersey set a drinking water limit of 5 ppb in 2006  the idlh immediately dangerous to life and health value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is 5mgm  the occupational safety and health administration has set the permissible exposure limit pel to a timeweighted average twa of 001mgm  and the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set the recommended exposure limit rel to a 15minute constant exposure of 0002mgm   the pel for organic arsenic compounds is a twa of 05mgm   in 2008 based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of american foods for toxic chemicals  the us food and drug administration set 23 ppb as the level of concern for inorganic arsenic apple and pear juices based on noncarcinogenic effects and began refusing imports and demanding recalls for domestic products exceeding this level  in 2011 the national dr oz television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers though the methodology was disputed it did not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic the tests showed levels of arsenic up to 36 ppb  in response fda testing of the worst brand from the oz show showed much lower levels and its ongoing testing found 95 of apple juice samples were below the level of concern later testing by consumer reports showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above 10 ppb with the organization urging parents to reduce consumption  in july 2013 after taking into account consumption by children chronic exposure and carcinogenic effect the fda established an action level of 10 ppb for apple juice the same as the drinking water standard  concern about arsenic in rice in bangladesh was raised in 2002 but at the time only australia had a legal limit for the level found in food one milligram per kilogram   the peoples republic of china has a food standard of 150 ppb for arsenic as of 2011  further concern was raised about people who were eating us rice exceeding who standards for personal arsenic intake in 2005  in the united states in 2012 testing by separate groups of researchers at the childrens environmental health and disease prevention research center at dartmouth college early in the year focusing on urinary levels in children  and consumer reports in november   found levels of arsenic in rice which resulted in calls for the fda to set limits  the fda released some testing results in september 2012   and as of july 2013 is still collecting data in support of a new potential regulation it has not recommended any changes in consumer behavior  consumer reports recommended that the epa and fda eliminate arseniccontaining fertilizer drugs and pesticides in food production that the fda establish a legal limit for food that industry change production practices to lower arsenic levels especially in food for children and that consumers test home water supplies eat a varied diet and cook rice with excess water which is drained off reducing inorganic arsenic by about one third along with a slight reduction in vitamin content  evidencebased public health advocates also recommend that given the lack of regulation or labeling for arsenic in the us children should eat no more than 15 servings per week of rice and should not drink rice milk as part of their daily diet before age 5  they also offer recommendations for adults and infants on how to limit arsenic exposure from rice drinking water and fruit juice  a 2014 world health organization advisory conference will consider limits of 200300 ppb for rice  the high affinity of arseniciii oxides for thiols is usually assigned as the cause of the high toxicity thiols usually in the form of cysteine residues but also in cofactors such as lipoic acid and coenzyme a are situated at the active sites of many important enzymes  arsenic disrupts atp production through several mechanisms at the level of the citric acid cycle arsenic inhibits lipoic acid which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase in addition by competing with phosphate arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation thus inhibiting energylinked reduction of nad mitochondrial respiration and atp synthesis hydrogen peroxide production is also increased which it is speculated has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress these metabolic interferences lead to death from multisystem organ failure the organ failure is presumed to be from necrotic cell death not apoptosis since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur  although arsenic causes toxicity it can also play a protective role  occupational exposure and arsenic poisoning may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds such as wood preservation glass production nonferrous metal alloys and electronic semiconductor manufacturing inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry  the ability of arsenic to undergo redox conversion between asiii and asv makes its availability in the environment more abundant according to croal gralnick malasarn and newman the understanding of what stimulates asiii oxidation andor limits asv reduction is relevant for bioremediation of contaminated sites croal the study of chemolithoautotrophic asiii oxidizers and the heterotrophic asv reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation andor reduction of arsenic  it has been proposed that as iii which is more toxic than arsenic v can be removed from the ground water using bakers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is possible british antilewisite dimercaprol is prescribed in doses of 5mgkg up to 300mg every 4hours for the first day then every 6hours for the second day and finally every 8hours for 8 additional days  however the usas agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr states that the longterm effects of arsenic exposure cannot be predicted  blood urine hair and nails may be tested for arsenic however these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure  excretion occurs in the urine and longterm exposure to arsenic has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver prostate skin lungs and nasal cavity

V dislocation of the hip is a common injury to the hip joint dislocation occurs when the ballshaped head of the femur comes out of the cupshaped acetabulum set in the pelvis this may happen to a varying degree a dislocated hip much more common in females than in males is a condition that can either be congenital or acquired  understanding the epidemiology anatomy difference between congenital and acquired screening treatments and rehabilitation are all relevant to the topic   acquired hip dislocation has the highest incidence rate immediately after hip replacement surgery and continues to have a high level for possibility of incidence throughout the first three months following the surgery following a primary total hip replacement surgery 39 of patients experience hip dislocation during the twentysix postoperative weeks following a revision total hip replacement surgery approximately 144 of patients experience hip dislocation during the twentysix postoperative weeks the incidence of hip dislocation following hip replacement surgery greatly depends on patient surgical and hip implant factors preoperative hip range is the most likely the most influential contribution as to whether a hip is able to remain stable or not because hip stability greatly depends on hip range of motion it is crucial for a hips postoperative range of motion to fall within a certain range in order to ensure maximum stability  following partial or total hip replacement surgery patients with 115 degrees or greater of combined preoperative adduction internal rotation and adduction as well as a posterior approach experienced hip dislocation at a considerably higher frequency than patients who had less than 115 degrees of combined hip range of motion in addition to the degrees of range of motion a patient possesses post surgery size of the femoral head is another large contributing factor to the stability of the hip high preoperative motion in combination with a posterior approach and femoral head size that is less than 32mm had the highest hip dislocation rate in general the larger the head of the femur post surgery the less likely a patient is to experience dislocation this is because during the replacement surgery a patients ball and socket of the femur head and hip socket are changed and no longer fit together in the perfect way they did prior to surgery when a femur head is smaller than 32mm post surgery the looser the ball femur head fits inside the hip socket therefore increasing the likelihood for the femur to slip and slide out of the socket causing hip dislocation  epidemiology is divided into five age groups which are newborns less than one year old the next age group is people from the ages of 117 the third age group is 1844 years old the fourth age group is 4564 and the final age group is 6588 years old the age group of 1 has 2233 cases which accounts for 6007 of all known cases the age group of 117 has 686 cases which accounts for 1844 of all cases of congenital hip dislocation the next age group which is 1844 has 249 cases which accounts for 670 of all cases and the age group of 4564 has 332 cases which is about 893 of all cases finally the age group of 6584 has 158 cases which accounts for 425 of all cases of congenital hip dislocation the epidemiology also shows that females are more prevalent to get congenital hip dislocation compared to their male counterparts females had 2571 cases which is 6915 of all cases while for men there are 1136 cases which makes up 3056 of all cases of congenital hip dislocation the costs vary from age groups the mean costs for the age group 1 is 7803 while the median cost is 7045 the costs for the age group of 117 are 13573 for a mean and the median cost is 12513 the mean cost for the age group of 1844 is 16656 and the median cost is 14082 finally the age group of 4564 has a mean cost of 14388 and a median cost of 12321 the amount of days of the hospital stay varies as well in the age group 117 the length of stay is about 27 days for the people ages 1844 the average stay is 44 days and the people ages 4564 stay for about 34 days in the hospital setting  hip dislocation cases in people in the age group from 1 through 17 years old is 434 which is 1620 the age group of 1844 has 1026 cases which accounts for 3830 of hip dislocations the age group of 4564 has 563 cases which account for 2100 of cases and people from the ages of 65 through 84 years old have 210 cases which makes up 782 of cases of hip dislocation hip dislocation is more prevalent in males by 2 compared to females hip dislocation cases in males are 1348 which accounts for 5031 of cases and the number of hip dislocations in females are 1312 which makes up of 4896 of hip dislocations hip dislocation most likely occurs at the age group of people ages to 1844  it can also happen with individuals with connective tissue conditions ie ehlers danlos syndrome  the hip is considered one of the more complex regions of our body due to its multiaxial arrangement there are many movements hip flexion hip extension hip abduction hip adduction hip external rotation hip internal rotation hip diagonal abduction hip diagonal adduction and anterior posterior lateral and transverse pelvic rotation that are associated with the hip  the pelvis and femur are the two main bones that form the hip joint there is an articulation of the head of the femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis together they make the hip joint an enarthrodial joint there are two pelvic bones right and left each consisting of the ilium ischium and the pubis they connect to form the symphysis pubis on the anterior side while the posterior side connects with the sacrum and coccyx to form sacroiliac joints these bones are joined with help of strong ligaments making them slightly movable joints there are five strong and dense ligaments that help to reinforce the hip joint they include the iliofemoral ligament the teres ligament the pubofemoral ligament the ischiofemoral ligament and the zona orbicularis ligament  the location of many of the muscles associated with the hip joint and pelvic girdle depend on the action the anterior side of the hip exhibits primarily hip flexion with help from the rectus femoris iliopsoas pectineus and sartorius the lateral side performs primarily hip abduction with help from the gluteus medius gluteus minimus external rotators and the tensor fasciae latae the posterior side exhibits primarily hip extension with help from the gluteus maximus hamstring muscles biceps femoris semitendinosus semimembranosus and the six deep external rotators piriformis obturator externus obturator internus gemellus superior gemellus inferior and quadrates femoris the medial side performs primarily hip adduction with help from the adductor brevis adductor longus adductor magnus and the gracilis  hip flexion and hip extension take place in the sagittal plane while hip abduction and adduction move the femur in the frontal plane hip external and internal rotation laterally and medially moves the femur in the transverse plane respectively anterior and posterior pelvic rotation involves anterior and posterior movement of the upper pelvis in the sagittal plane respectively lateral pelvic rotation left and right occurs in the frontal plane whereas transverse pelvic rotation left and right occurs in the horizontal plane  the hip joint includes the articulation of the femoral head of femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis in hip dislocation the femoral head is dislodged from this socket posterior dislocation is the most prevalent in which the femoral head lies posterior and superior to the acetabulum this is most common when the femur is adducted and internally rotated the opposite is true for the shoulder where the most common dislocation occurs in the anterior and inferior directions  the posterior side of the hip exhibits primarily hip extension dealing with the muscles gluteus maximus hamstring muscles biceps femoris semitendinosus semimembranosus and the six deep external rotators piriformis obturator externus obturator internus gemellus superior gemellus inferior and quadrates femoris  nine out of ten hip dislocations are posterior the affected limb will be shortened and internally rotated in this case posterior dislocations with an associated fracture are categorised by the thompson and epstein classification system in an anterior dislocation the limb will not be shortened as noticeably and will be externally rotated in both cases the affected leg is virtually immovable by the patient and is usually extremely painful congenital hip dislocation must be detected early when it can be easily treated by a few weeks of traction if it is not detected the childs hip may develop incorrectly seen when the child begins to walk if one hip is affected the child will have a limp and lurch and with bilateral dislocation there will be a waddling gait on physical exam with the baby in the supine position the examiner flexes both the hips and knees to 90 degrees and holding the knees pushes gently downward which may induce a posterior dislocation or subluxation keeping the baby in this 90 degree flexed position the examiner then externally rotates the thighs a normal infant will demonstrate no evidence of dislocation it can also be detected with the galeazzi test congenital hip dislocation is much more common in girls than boys  acquired hip dislocations are extremely painful and commonly occur during car accidents they may be treated by surgical realignment and traction usually hip dislocation occurs when the head of the femur dislodges from its socket form the pelvis in most patients the femur shifts out of its socket in a posterior dislocation direction the hip is now in a position where it is twisted in toward the middle of the body the femur could also shift in an anterior direction which the hip will twist outward and away from the middle of the body this dislocation is very painful and patients are unable to move when it occurs due to the dislocation there could be some nerve damage resulting in loss of feeling in the foot or ankle  to actually dislocate a healthy hip a great amount of force needs to be applied motor vehicle accidents are the most common ways that hip dislocations occur falls from a height such as a ladder can also generate enough force to dislocate a hip in older individuals even a slight fall could cause this type of injury wear and tear that the body undergoes throughout the years leads to increased incidents of hip dislocation in the older population  hip injuries in sports are also quite common in contact sports such as rugby and american football hip dislocation is a result of great amounts of force applied to the body during contact and collision in other sports such as water skiing skiingsnowboarding gymnastics and basketball these injuries are less common because there are fewer collisions and less contact however when the amount of force to the hip joint is greater than the muscles of the hip can compensate for hip injuries can still occur  several other injuries are also associated with hip dislocation fractures in the pelvis and legs and minor back or head injuries can also occur along with a hip dislocation that is caused by a fall or athletic of injury congenital hip dislocation also known as dysplasia of the hip is a condition in which a child is born with a hip problem congenital hip dislocation is when the formation of the hip joint is abnormal the ball at the top of the thighbone which is known as the femoral head is not stable within the socket which is also known as the acetabulum this abnormality may cause the ligaments of the hip to be loose or stretched this condition is usually diagnosed once the baby is born it mostly affects the left side of the hip in firstborn children girls and babies born in a breech position girls are four times as likely to have hip dysplasia compared to boys the cause of this condition is still unknown however some factors of congenital hip dislocation are through heredity and racial background it is also thought that the higher incidence in some ethnic groups  such as some native american groups is due to the practice swaddling of infants which is known to be a potential risk factor for developing dysplasia it also has a low prevalence risk in african americans and southern chinese native americans are more likely to have congenital hip dislocation than any of the other races the risk for native americans is about 2550 in 1000 the overall frequency of developmental dysplasia of the hip is approximately 1 case per 1000 individuals however barlow believed that the incidence of hip instability in newborns can be as high as 1 case for every 60 newborns  the early sign of congenital hip dislocation is when a person is able to hear clicking sounds when the legs are moved apart from one another this condition can be treated if detected early if this condition goes undetected it can cause one leg to look shorter than its counterpart and the buttock folds are also not symmetrical which causes more creases to be present on the affected side and skin folds at the thigh are uneven another sign is that when a child begins to walk he or she may have a limp and favor the affected side when walking when a child is walking it may be also walking on its toes or waddle like a duck if the condition goes undetected it may cause negative longterm effects such as osteoarthritis as well affect the gait of the child when it first learns to walk the baby may also learn how to walk much later than expected  screening for congenital hip dislocation is done once the baby is born the hospital staff does a number of reflex exercises to check that all of the babys reactions are normal there are two ways that congenital hip dislocation can be detected through the ortolani maneuver and the barlow maneuver  in order to do the ortolani maneuver it is recommended that the examiner put the newborn baby in a position in which the contralateral hip is held still while the thigh of the hip being tested is abducted and gently pulled anteriorly if a clunk is heard the sound of the femoral head moving over the acetabulum the joint is normal but absence of the clunk sound indicates that the acetabulum is not fully developed the next method that can be used is called the barlow maneuver it is done by adducting the hip while pushing the thigh posteriorly if the hip goes out of the socket it means it is dislocated and the newborn has a congenital hip dislocation the baby is laid on its back for examination by separation of its legs if a clicking sound can be heard it indicates that the baby may have a dislocated hip it is highly recommended that these maneuvers be done when the baby is not fussing because the baby may inhibit hip movement there is yet another way to detect congenital hip dislocation and it is called the tonic labyrinthine reflex tlr it is a reflex present in newborn babies it is suggested that in order to perform this reflex exercise the babys head should be tilted back causing the back to stiffen the legs are straightened and pushed together with the toes pointed and the arms are bent at the elbows and wrists the hands are put into a fist or the fingers curled if this reflex is present past the newborn stage the person may have an abnormal extension pattern  there are numerous ways in order to address this condition one treatment that can be used on newborns or infants is called a pavlik harness the pavlik harness is a soft harnesslike device that has straps that hold the legs apart and bent at the knee in an attempt to keep the femur ball in the acetabulum socket in the correct position another treatment method that can be used to fix the condition is closed reduction in which the hip is positioned under anesthesia this particular procedure can be done on children from the ages of six months to two years old if the closed reduction treatment does not work then open reduction surgery is another option to use after the closed or open surgery is performed the child may use a cast or brace in order to keep the hip bone in the socket while it is healing by using one of these treatment methods the child can have normal hip joint function  hip dislocation rehabilitation can take anywhere from two to three months depending on the patient complications to nearby nerves and blood vessels can sometimes cause loss of blood supply to the bone also known as osteonecrosis the protective cartilage on the bone can also be disturbed from this type of injury for this reason it is important for patients to contact a physician and get treatment immediately following injury  individuals suffering from hip dislocation should participate in physical therapy and receive professional prescriptive exercises based on their individual abilities progress and overall range of motion the following are some typical recommended exercises used as rehabilitation for hip dislocation it is important to understand that each individual has different capabilities that can best be assessed by a physical therapist or medical professional and that these are simply recommendations

V fundic gland polyposis is a medical syndrome where the fundus and the body of the stomach develop many polyps the condition has been described both in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis fap and attenuated variants afap and in patients in whom it occurs sporadically    most patients with fundic gland polyps fgps do not have any symptoms and the diagnosis is made on gastroscopy done for other reasons retrospective analysis of patients with sporadic fgps shows that a high percentage do have symptoms but that this is more likely to be related to the underlying disease responsible for the polyposis  these symptoms include the polyps on endoscopy are usually tiny numerous and sessile  and usually scattered throughout the fundus of the stomach where parietal cells are more numerous they have the same colour as the gastric mucosa and never have a stalk  when the polyps are biopsied the pathology typically shows shortened gastric pits and both superficial and deep cystic lesions in the fundic glands as sometimes parietal cell hyperplasia may develop deep dilations of gland  one should be really strict in the diagnosis of fgps ie the presence of deep and superficial dilations infrequently the two lesions may coexist  foci of dysplasia can sometimes be seen  fundic gland polyps are found in 08 to 19 of patients who undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy and are more common in middle aged women  the most important consideration in evaluating patients with fgps is distinguishing between sporadic form patients without any other gastrointestinal condition usually in middle age with female prevalence and syndromic form this is to ascertain the risk of development of gastric cancer and to ascertain the risk of concomitant colon cancer fgps can be found in association with the following genetic conditions  sporadic fgps   have been associated with the development of polyps depends on the underlying disorder in sporadic cases of fgps more than 90 of patients have activating mutations in the \u03b2catenin gene  in familial adenomatous polyposis the abnormality is a mutation in the apc gene resulting in its inactivity attenuated fap can occur from other mutations in the apc gene and causes a phenotype wherein colonic polyps may be few in number   both the \u03b2catenin gene and the apc gene are involved in the same cell growth signalling pathway but the apc gene is known to have a significantly higher association with the development of colorectal tumors  there is a risk of development of cancer with fundic gland polyposis  but it varies based on the underlying cause of the polyposis  the risk is highest with congenital polyposis syndromes and is lowest in acquired causes   as a result it is recommend that patients with multiple fundic polyps have a colonoscopy to evaluate the colon  if there are polyps seen on colonoscopy genetic testing and testing of family members is recommended  a new syndrome has been described the gastric adenocarcinoma associated with proxymal polyposis of the stomach gapps this condition described in three families   is characterized by development of antral adenomas and fgps with early development of severe dysplasia and gastric cancer in absence of intestinal polyposis gapps has a dominant mode of trasmission and the genetic defect is unknown it is still unclear which patients would benefit with surveillance gastroscopy but most physicians recommend endoscopy every one to three years to survey polyps for dysplasia or cancer  in the event of high grade dysplasia polypectomy which is done through the endoscopy or partial gastrectomy may be recommended one study showed the benefit of nsaid therapy in regression of gastric polyps but the efficacy of this strategy given the side effects of nsaids is still dubious

V chiari malformation also known as arnoldchiari malformation is a condition affecting the brain it consists of a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum the opening at the base of the skull sometimes causing noncommunicating hydrocephalus  as a result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid csf outflow  the cerebrospinal fluid outflow is caused by phase difference in outflow and influx of blood in the vasculature of the brain it can cause headaches fatigue muscle weakness difficulty swallowing sometimes accompanied by gagging choking and vomiting dizziness nausea tinnitus impaired coordination neck pain unsteady gait problems with balance poor hand coordination fine motor skills numbness and tingling of the hands and feet and speech problems such as hoarseness less often people with chiari malformation may experience ringing or buzzing in the ears tinnitus weakness slow heart rhythm curvature of the spine scoliosis related to spinal cord impairment abnormal breathing such as central sleep apnea characterized by periods of breathing cessation during sleep and in severe cases paralysis     the blockage of cerebrospinal fluid csf flow may also cause a syrinx to form eventually leading to syringomyelia central cord symptoms such as hand weakness dissociated sensory loss and in severe cases paralysis may occur  syringomyelia is a chronic progressive degenerative disorder characterized by a fluidfilled cyst located in the spinal cord its symptoms include pain weakness numbness and stiffness in the back shoulders arms or legs other symptoms include headaches the inability to feel changes in the temperature sweating sexual dysfunction and loss of bowel and bladder control it is usually seen in the cervical region but can extend into the medulla oblongata and pons or it can reach downward into the thoracic or lumbar segments syringomyelia is often associated with chiari malformation type i and is commonly seen between the c4 and c6 levels the exact development of syringomyelia is unknown but many theories suggest that the herniated tonsils in chiari malformation type i form a plug which does not allow an outlet of csf from the brain to the spinal canal syringomyelia is present in 25 of patients with chiari malformation  the most widely accepted pathophysiological mechanism by which chiari type i malformations occur is by a reduction or lack of development of the posterior fossa as a result of congenital or acquired disorders congenital causes include hydrocephalus craniosynostosis especially of the lambdoid suture hyperostosis such as craniometaphyseal dysplasia osteopetrosis erythroid hyperplasia xlinked vitamin dresistant rickets and neurofibromatosis type i acquired disorders include space occupying lesions due to one of several potential causes ranging from brain tumors to hematomas  head trauma may cause cerebellar tonsillar ectopia possibly because of dural strain  additionally ectopia may be present but asymptomatic until whiplash causes it to become symptomatic  posterior fossa hypoplasia causes reduced cerebral and spinal compliance diagnosis is made through a combination of patient history neurological examination and medical imaging  magnetic resonance imaging mri is considered the best imaging modality for chiari malformation since it visualizes neural tissue such as the cerebellar tonsils and spinal cord as well as bone and other soft tissues ct and ct myelography are other options and were used prior to advent of mri however they characterize syringomyelia and other neural abnormalities less well by convention the cerebellar tonsil position is measured relative to the basionopisthion line using sagittal t1 mri images or sagittal ct images  the selected cutoff distance for abnormal tonsil position is somewhat arbitrary since not everyone will be symptomatic at a certain amount of tonsil displacement and the probability of symptoms and syrinx increases with greater displacement however greater than 5mm is the most frequently cited cutoff number though some consider 35mm to be borderline and symptoms and syrinx may occur above that    one study showed little difference in cerebellar tonsil position between standard recumbent mri and upright mri for patients without a history of whiplash injury  neuroradiological investigation is used to first rule out any intracranial condition that could be responsible for tonsillar herniation neuroradiological diagnostics evaluate the severity of crowding of the neural structures within the posterior cranial fossa and their impact on the foramen magnum chiari 15 is a term used when both brainstem and tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum are present  the diagnosis of a chiari ii malformation can be made prenatally through ultrasound   in the late 19th century austrian pathologist hans chiari described seemingly related anomalies of the hindbrain the socalled chiari malformations i ii and iii later other investigators added a fourth chiari iv malformation the scale of severity is rated i  iv with iv being the most severe types iii and iv are very rare  can be congenital or acquired through trauma when congential may be asymptomatic during childhood but often manifests with headaches and cerebellar symptoms herniation of cerebellar tonsils     tonsillar ectopia below the foramen magnum with greater than 5mm below as the most commonly cited cutoff value for abnormal position however this is somewhat arbitrary and controversial     syringomyelia of cervical or cervicothoracic spinal cord can be seen sometimes the medullary kink and brainstem elongation can be seen syndrome of occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility is an acquired chiari i malformation in patients with hereditary disorders of connective tissue  patients who exhibit extreme joint hypermobility and connective tissue weakness as a result of ehlersdanlos syndrome or marfan syndrome are susceptible to instabilities of the craniocervical junction thus they are at risk for acquiring a chiari malformation other conditions sometimes associated with chiari malformation include hydrocephalus  syringomyelia spinal curvature tethered spinal cord syndrome and connective tissue disorders  such as ehlersdanlos syndrome  and marfan syndrome chiari malformation is the most frequently used term for this set of conditions the use of the term arnoldchiari malformation has fallen somewhat out of favor over time although it is used to refer to the type ii malformation current sources use chiari malformation to describe four specific types of the condition reserving the term arnoldchiari for type ii only  some sources still use arnoldchiari for all four types  chiari malformation or arnoldchiari malformation should not be confused with buddchiari syndrome  a hepatic condition also named for hans chiari in pseudochiari malformation leaking of csf may cause displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and similar symptoms sufficient to be mistaken for a chiari i malformation  while there is no current cure the treatments for chiari malformation are surgery and management of symptoms based on the occurrence of clinical symptoms rather than the radiological findings the presence of a syrinx is known to give specific signs and symptoms that vary from dysesthetic sensations to algothermal dissociation to spasticity and paresis these are important indications that decompressive surgery is needed for patients with chiari malformation type ii type ii patients have severe brain stem damage and rapidly diminishing neurological response   decompressive surgery  involves removing the lamina of the first and sometimes the second or third cervical vertebrae and part of the occipital bone of the skull to relieve pressure the flow of spinal fluid may be accompanied by a shunt since this surgery usually involves the opening of the dura mater and the expansion of the space beneath a dural graft is usually applied to cover the expanded posterior fossa a small number of neurological surgeons  believe that detethering the spinal cord as an alternate approach relieves the compression of the brain against the skull opening foramen magnum obviating the need for decompression surgery and associated trauma however this approach is significantly less documented in the medical literature with reports on only a handful of patients it should be noted that the alternative spinal surgery is also not without risk  complications of decompression surgery can arise they include bleedings damage to structures in the brain and spinal canal meningitis csf fistulas occipitocervical instability and pseudomeningeocele rare postoperative complications include hydrocephalus and brain stem compression by retroflexion of odontoid also an extended cvd created by a wide opening and big duroplasty can cause a cerebellar slump this complication needs to be corrected by cranioplasty  in cases with brainstem dysfunction anterior decompression may also be required on april 24 2009 a young patient with type 1 chiari malformation was successfully treated with a minimally invasive endoscopic transnasal procedure followed by a posterior decompression and fusion by richard anderson and colleagues at the columbia university medical center department of neurosurgery  this technique was later published by hankinson and colleagues in the journal of neurosurgery  the prevalence of congenital chiari i malformation defined as tonsilar herniations of 3 to 5mm or greater was previously believed to be in the range of one per 1000 births but is likely much higher   women are three times more likely than men to have a congenital chiari malformation  type ii malformations are more prevalent in people of celtic descent  a study using upright mri found cerebellar tonsillar ectopia in 23 of adults with headache from motorvehicleaccident head trauma upright mri was more than twice as sensitive as standard mri likely because gravity affects cerebellar position  cases of congenital chiari malformation may be explained by evolutionary and genetic factors typically an infants brain weighs around 400g at birth and triples to 11001400g by age 11 at the same time the cranium triples in volume from 500cm  to 1500cm  to accommodate the growing brain  during human evolution the skull underwent numerous changes to accommodate the growing brain the evolutionary changes included increased size and shape of the skull decreased basal angle and basicranial length these modifications resulted in significant reduction of the size of the posterior fossa in modern humans in normal adults the posterior fossa comprises 27 of the total intracranial space while in adults with chiari type i it is only 21  if a modern brain is paired with a less modern skull the posterior fossa may be too small so that the only place where the cerebellum can expand is the foramen magnum leading to development of chiari type i  h neanderthalensis had platycephalic flattened skull some cases of chiari are associated with platybasia flattening of the skull base  the history of chiari malformation is described below and categorized by the year the condition was brought to the mainstream on the series csi crime scene investigation in the tenth season episode internal combustion on february 4 2010  chiari malformation was briefly mentioned on the medical drama house md in the fifth season episode house divided  and it was the focus of the sixth season episode the choice it is also the focus of private practice season 4 episode 4 where a pregnant woman is diagnosed with it it was also mentioned in the medical drama a gifted man in the first season episode in case of separation anxiety  chairi malformation has also been featured in nonfiction tv shows season 5 episode 2 of extreme makeover home edition features a family where both mom and daughters have chiari malformation on the discovery health channels series mystery diagnosis a young girl is diagnosed with chiari malformation and ehlersdanlos syndrome in the first

V an accessory auricle is considered a developmental anomaly resulting from the persistence of a structure which variably recapitulates the normal external ear   there may be several components or degrees of development ranging from an ear tag preauricular appendage preauricular tag accessory tragus to supernumerary ears or polyotia   it is a relatively common congenital anomaly of the first branchial arch or second branchial arches other anomalies may be present concurrently including cleft palate cleft lip or mandibular hypoplasia there is a known association with goldenhar syndrome oculoauriculovertebral syndrome  and with wildervanck syndrome    there may also be an association with congenital cartilaginous rest of the neck the general presentation is of a skincovered nodule papule or nodule of the skin surface usually immediately anterior to the auricle however it may be anywhere within the periauricular tissues bilateral presentation can be seen      the lesions presents as a nodule or papule either sessile or pedunculated they may be soft or have a cartilaginous structure by histologic examination it is a recapitulation of normal external auricle there will be skin cartilaginous structures and cartilage although the later is not seen in all variants of this disorder   some investigators believe that the tragus is the only hillock which is derived from the first branchial arch this is clearly suggestive that true cases of accessory auricle represent a true duplication of the hillocks that were part of the second branchial arch  the second ear appears as a mirror image folded forward and lying on the posterior cheek these structures are distinctly different from squamous papilloma and benign teratoma simple surgical excision is curative  the recommended treatment is that the skin is peeled off the extraauricular tissue and protruding cartilage remnants are trimmed  normal appearance is achieved in majority of cases the reconstruction successful in true cases of accessory auricle as it also is in individuals with auricular appendages   these lesions usually present in neonates although they may not come to clinical attention until adulthood for cosmetic reasons there is no gender predilection they are present in approximately 36 per 1000 live births  lester d r thompson bruce m wenig 2011 diagnostic pathology head and neck published by amirsys hagerstown md lippincott williams  wilkins pp723 isbn1931884617

V proteus syndrome also known as wiedemann syndrome named after the german pediatrician hansrudolf wiedemann is a rare congenital disorder   that causes skin overgrowth and atypical bone development often accompanied by tumors over half the body   proteus syndrome is highly variable  and is named after the greek seagod proteus who could change his shape the condition appears to have been first described in the american medical literature by drs samia temtamy and john rogers in 1976   dr michael cohen described it in 1979  only a few more than 200 cases have been confirmed worldwide with estimates that about 120 people are currently alive with the condition  as attenuated forms of the disease may exist there could be many people with proteus syndrome who remain undiagnosed those most readily diagnosed are also the most severely disfigured   proteus syndrome causes an overgrowth of skin bones muscles fatty tissues and blood and lymphatic vessels proteus syndrome is a progressive condition wherein children are usually born without any obvious deformities tumors of skin and bone growths appear as they age the severity and locations of these various asymmetrical growths vary greatly but typically the skull one or more limbs and soles of the feet will be affected there is a risk of premature death in affected individuals due to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism caused by the vessel malformations that are associated with this disorder because of carrying excess weight and enlarged limbs arthritis and muscle pain may also be symptoms  as is the case for mandy sellars a woman living with a form of proteus syndrome  but see notable cases below further risks may occur due to the mass of extra tissue the disorder itself does not uniformly cause learning impairments the distribution of intelligence deficits among sufferers of proteus syndrome appears higher than that of the general population although this is difficult to determine with statistical significance  in addition the presence of visible deformity may have a negative effect on the social experiences of the sufferer causing cognitive and social deficits afflicted individuals are at increased risk for developing certain tumors including unilateral ovarian cystadenomas testicular tumors meningiomas and monomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland  in 2011 researchers determined the cause of proteus syndrome in 26 of 29 patients who met strict clinical criteria for the disorder lindhurst et al identified an activating mutation in akt1 kinase in a mosaic state gene  this mutation in the akt1 gene was present in all 26 affected patients previous research had suggested the condition linked to pten on chromosome 10  while other research pointed to chromosome 16  prior to the findings regarding akt1 in 2011 other researchers expressed doubt regarding the involvement of pten or gpc3 which codes for glypican 3 and may play a role in regulating cell division and growth regulation   a team of doctors in australia have trial tested the drug rapamycin in the treatment of a patient said to have proteus syndrome and have found it to be an effective remedy  however the diagnosis of proteus syndrome in this patient has been questioned by others  the proteus syndrome research team in the national human genome research institute at the united states national institutes of health have initiated a phase 0 dose finding trial with the akt1 inhibitor arq 092 which is being developed by the arqule corporation this trial opened in november of 2015 and is currently recruiting patients in a study titled dose finding trial of arq 092 in children and adults with proteus syndrome clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct02594215 url  httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct02594215 this trial is based on in vitro data showing inhibition of akt1 in cell lines from patients with proteus syndrome url  httpwwwnaturecomarticlessrep17162 many sources classify proteus syndrome to be a type of nevus syndrome the lesions appear to be distributed in a mosaic manner  it has been confirmed that the disorder is an example of genetic mosaicism  in 1971 ashley montagu suggested in his book the elephant man a study in human dignity that joseph merrick suffered from neurofibromatosis type 1 nf1 and this has continued to be reported newer research has suggested that merricks deformities were actually caused by proteus syndrome ps or possibly by a combination of nf1 with ps however the exact condition suffered by joseph merrick is still not known with certainty   mandy sellars has been diagnosed by some doctors as suffering from this condition  her legs and feet have grown at a disproportionate rate since birth however in 2013 sellars case was profiled on british television in a special called shrinking my 17 stone legs in which it was determined that sellars condition was not in fact proteus syndrome but rather a pik3ca gene mutation

V bladder exstrophy also known as ectopia vesicae is a congenital anomaly that exists along the spectrum of the exstrophyepispadias complex and most notably involves protrusion of the urinary bladder through a defect in the abdominal wall its presentation is variable often including abnormalities of the bony pelvis pelvic floor and genitalia the underlying embryologic mechanism leading to bladder exstrophy is unknown though it is thought to be in part due to failed reinforcement of the cloacal membrane by underlying mesoderm    occurring at a rate between 1 in 10000 to 1 in 50000   with a maletofemale ratio of 2361    bladder exstrophy is relatively rare for those individuals with bladder exstrophy who maintain their ability to reproduce the risk of bladder exstrophy in their children is approximately 500fold greater than the general population  the classic manifestation of bladder exstrophy presents with females frequently have a displaced and narrowed vaginal orifice a bifid clitoris and divergent labia  in a small retrospective study of 25 pregnancies five factors were found to be strongly associated with a prenatal diagnosis of bladder exstrophy while a diagnosis of bladder exstrophy was made retrospectively in a majority of pregnancies in only three cases was a prenatal diagnosis made  upon delivery the exposed bladder is irrigated and a nonadherent film is placed to prevent as much contact with the external environment as possible in the event the child was not born at a medical center with an appropriate exstrophy support team then transfer will likely follow upon transfer or for those infants born at a medical center able to care for bladder exstrophy imaging may take place in the first few hours of life prior to the child undergoing surgery  primary immediate closure is indicated only in those patients with a bladder of appropriate size elasticity and contractility as those patients are most likely to develop a bladder of adequate capacity after early surgical intervention  conditions that are absolute contraindications despite bladder adequacy include duplication of the penis or scrotum and significant bilateral hydronephrosis modern therapy is aimed at surgical reconstruction of the bladder and genitalia throughout time numerous approaches have been developed but today only two remain with any frequency the most important criterion for improving longterm prognosis is success of the initial closure   if a patient requires more than one closure their chance of continence drops off precipitously with each additional closure  at just two closures the chance of voiding continence is just 17  even with successful surgery patients may have longterm complications  some of the most common include

V polydactyly or polydactylism from greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2 polys meaning many and \u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 daktylos meaning finger also known as hyperdactyly is a congenital physical anomaly in humans dogs and cats having supernumerary fingers or toes  polydactyly is the opposite of oligodactyly fewer fingers or toes in humansanimals this condition can present itself on one or both hands the extra digit is usually a small piece of soft tissue that can be removed occasionally it contains bone without joints rarely it may be a complete functioning digit the extra digit is most common on the ulnar little finger side of the hand less common on the radial thumb side and very rarely within the middle three digits these are respectively known as postaxial little finger preaxial thumb and central ring middle index fingers polydactyly the extra digit is most commonly an abnormal fork in an existing digit or it may rarely originate at the wrist as a normal digit does  the world record holder for highest number of digits is akshat saxena from uttar pradesh india he was born in 2010 with 7 digits on each hand and 10 digits on each foot for a total of 34 digits the incidence of congenital deformities in newborns is approximately 2 and 10 of these deformities involve the upper extremity   congenital anomalies of the limb can be classified in seven categories proposed by frantz and orahilly and modified by swanson based on the embryonic failure causing the clinical presentation these categories are failure of formation of parts failure of differentiation duplication overgrowth undergrowth congenital constriction band syndrome and generalized skeletal abnormalities   polydactyly belongs to the category of duplication  because there is an association between polydactyly and several syndromes children with a congenital upper extremity deformity should be examined by a geneticist for other congenital anomalies likewise if a syndrome is suspected or over two or three generations of the family are affected  research has shown that the majority of congenital anomalies occur during the 4week embryologic period of rapid limb development  polydactyly has been associated with 39 genetic mutations  more specific loci and genetic mechanisms responsible for disorders of duplications will be defined with time as molecular research continues  polydactyly can be divided into three major types which are discussed below this is the most common situation in which the extra digit is on the ulnar side of the hand thus the side of the little finger this can also be called postaxial polydactyly it can manifest itself very subtly for instance only as a nubbin on the ulnar side of the little finger or very distinctly as a fully developed finger most commonly the extra finger is rudimentary consisting of an end phalanx with a nail and connected to the hand with a small skin pedicle mostly one neurovascular bundle can be identified with no tendons present in the extra digit in case of a fully developed extra finger the duplication usually presents itself at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint a triplication of the little finger is very rare ulnar polydactyly occurs ten times more often in negroid ethnicities and is most common in african populations  the incidence in caucasians is reported as 1 in 1339 live births compared with 1 in 143 live births in africans and african americans ulnar polydactyly is also often part of a syndrome  in patients with african ancestry ulnar polydactyly mostly occurs isolated whereas the presentation in caucasians is often associated with a syndrome  in almost 14 of all patients this type of polydactyly is hereditary it usually passes on in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expression and incomplete penetrance it is genetically heterogenic meaning that mutations in different genes can be the cause when the extra digit is pedicled it can be very movable however injuries are rare and have never been reported so far  this is a less common situation which affects the side of the hand towards the thumb radial polydactyly refers to the presence of an extra digit or extra digits on the radial side of the hand it is most frequent in indian populations and it is the second most common congenital hand disorder the incidence of radial polydactyly is reported as 1 in every 3000 live births  the clinical features of radial polydactyly will depend upon the extent of duplication  radial polydactyly varies from a barely visible radial skin tag to complete duplication thumb polydactyly varies from barely visible broadening of the distal phalanx to full duplication of the thumb including the first metacarpal  radial polydactyly is frequently associated with several syndromes  this is a very rare situation in which the extra digit is on the ring middle or index finger of these fingers the index finger is most often affected whereas the ring finger is rarely affected  this type of polydactyly can be associated with syndactyly cleft hand and several syndromes   polysyndactyly presents various degrees of syndactyly affecting fingers three and four  polydactyly is associated with different mutations either mutations in a gene itself or in a cisregulatory element responsible for the expression of a specific gene mutations in hoxa or hoxd clusters are reported leading to polydactyly interactions of hoxd13 and gli3 induce synpolydactyly a combination of extra and consolidated digits other signal transduction pathways in this context are the wnt signaling pathway or notch  in the specific case of preaxial polydactyly hemingway mutant a cisacting mutation approximately 1mb upstream of shh gene has been implicated  normally shh is expressed in an organiser region called the zone of polarizing activity zpa on the posterior limb side from there it diffuses anteriorly laterally to the growth direction of the limb in the mutant smaller ectopic expression in a new organiser region is seen on the posterior side of the limb this ectopic expression causes cell proliferation delivering the raw material for one or more new digits    in addition to the study of genetic causes of polydactyly limb patterning models are used to simulate the congenital disorder at the limb being able to explain the development paths of polydactyly polydactyly can occur by itself or more commonly as one feature of a syndrome of congenital anomalies when it occurs by itself it is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in single genes ie it is not a multifactorial trait  but mutation in a variety of genes can give rise to polydactyly typically the mutated gene is involved in developmental patterning and a syndrome of congenital anomalies results of which polydactyly is one feature or two types include 97 genetic syndromes have been associated with different kinds of polydactyly  ulnar polydactyly is often bilateral and associated with syndactyly and polydactyly of the feet this can be a simple or complex polydactyly ulnar polydactyly occurs as an isolated congenital condition but can also be part of a syndrome the syndromes which occur with ulnar polydactyly are greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome meckel syndrome ellisvan creveld syndrome mckusickkaufman syndrome down syndrome bardetbiedl syndrome smithlemliopitz syndrome   type vii of radial polydactyly is associated with several syndromes holtoram syndrome fanconi anemia aplastic anemia by the age of 6 townesbrocks syndrome and greig cephalopolysyndactyly also known to occur with ulnar polydactyly  the syndromes associated with central polydactyly are bardetbiedl syndrome  meckel syndrome  pallisterhall syndrome  legius syndrome  holtoram syndrome  also central polydactyly can be associated with syndactyly and cleft hand   other syndromes including polydactyly include acrocallosal syndrome basal cell nevus syndrome biemond syndrome ectrodactylyectodermal dysplasiascleft lippalate syndrome mirror hand deformity mohr syndrome oralfacialdigital syndrome rubinsteintaybi syndrome short rib polydactyly and vater association  it can also occur with a triphalangeal thumb classification is performed by using xray imaging to see the bone structures  the classification of ulnar polydactyly exists of either two or three types the twostage classification according to temtamy and mckusick involves type a and b in type a there is an extra little finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint or more proximal including the carpometacarpal joint the little finger can be hypoplastic or fully developed type b varies from a nubbin to an extra nonfunctional little finger part on a pedicle according to the threetype classification type i includes nubbins or floating little fingers type ii includes duplications at the mcpj and type iii includes duplications of the entire ray  the wassel classification is the most widely used classification of radial polydactyly  based upon the most proximal level of skeletal duplication the most common type is wassel 4 about 50 of such duplications followed by wassel 2 20 and wassel 6 12  the classification of central polydactyly is based on the extent of duplication and involves the following three types type i is a central duplication not attached to the adjacent finger by osseous or ligamentous attachments it frequently does not include bones joints cartilage or tendons type iia is a nonsyndactylous duplication of a digit or part of a digit with normal components and articulates with a broad or bifid metacarpal or phalanx type iib is a syndactylous duplication of a digit or part of a digit with normal components and articulates with a broad or bifid metacarpal or phalanx type iii is a complete digital duplication which has a wellformed duplicated metacarpal   ulnar polydactyly usually does not interfere with hand function but for social reasons it can be treated operatively  the treatment of type a ulnar polydactyly is complex as its goal is to remove the accessory digit while maintaining a stable functional small finger when the duplicated proximal phalanx articulates with a common broad metacarpal head the ulnar collateral ligament must be considered in those cases with a common articulation or with a sixth metacarpal the muscle executing the abduction of the little finger abductor digiti minimi must be preserved  in patients with a common metacarpal articulation an elliptical incision at the base of the postaxial digit is made this incision may be extended proximally in order to adequately expose the abductor digiti minimi the ulnar collateral ligament and the insertions of the abductor digiti minimi are then elevated with a periosteal sleeve the duplicated extensor and flexor tendons to the ulnar digit are transected and after that the digit is amputated at its articulation with the metacarpal if the articular surface is wide the metacarpal may be shaved at last the collateral ligament and abductor digiti minimi are reinserted at the base of the preserved proximal phalanx and a wire is then placed across the reconstructed joint in patients with a duplicated metacarpal the accessory digit is amputated in a standard ray fashion with transfer of the abductor digiti minimi to the retained small finger  in this situation there is an absence of osseous and ligamentous structures the surgical technique is analogous to radial polydactyly in which the level of duplication and anatomical components should guide operative treatment  the pedicled ulnar extra digit can be removed by suture ligation to devise the skin bridge of the newborn child this might be easier than an excision of the extra digit when the child is 6 to 12 months old   ligation occludes the vascular supply to the duplicated digit resulting in dry gangrene and subsequent autoamputation  this must be done with consideration of the presence of a neurovascular bundle even in very small skin bridges when the ligation is done inappropriately it can give a residual nubbin also a neuroma can develop in the area of the scar an excision can prevent the development of a residual nubbin and the sensibility due to a neuroma  for infants with ulnar type b polydactyly the recommended treatment is ligation in the neonatal nursery studies have shown that excision of the extra digit in the neonatal nursery is a safe and simple procedure with a good clinical and cosmetic outcome  because neither of the two thumb components is normal a decision should be taken on combining which elements to create the best possible composite digit instead of amputating the most hypoplastic thumb preservation of skin nail collateral ligaments and tendons is needed to augment the residual thumb  surgery is recommended in the first year of life generally between 9 and 15 months of age  surgical options depend on type of polydactyly  this type of procedure is recommended for wassel types 1 and 2 in which both thumbs are severely hypoplastic by some congenital hand surgeons  the technique contains a composite wedge resection of the central bone and softtissue this will be achieved with approach of the lateral tissue of each thumb the goal is to achieve a normal thumb what concerns the size which is possible  if the width of the nail bed is greater than 70 of the contralateral thumb it may be split   then the nail bed will be repaired precisely this type of procedure is used for all wassel types of polydactyly and is the most commonly used technique it is recommended in all cases of thumb duplication with a hypoplastic lessfunctional thumb otherwise one could consider the bilhautcloquet the ulnar thumb is preferably preserved as it is the more developed one in most cases  by detaching the radial collateral ligament from distal to proximal a periosteal sleeve can be preserved  in this way the radial collateral band of the radial digit will function as the absent radial collateral ligament of the preserved ulnar thumb elevation of the apb and fpb is performed in wassel type 4 duplication this can be accomplished via the periosteum or separately as the tendons insert proximally the elevation is performed proximally too to potentially rebalance the ulnar thumb after the radial thumb is amputated the ulnar elements are centralized and fixed with a kirschner wire in most cases a longitudinal and sagittal osteotomy is needed to centralize the bony parts of the ulnar thumb while the softtissue of the radial thumb was preserved it is now attached to the radial side of the ulnar thumb together with the periosteal sleeve the apb and fpb of the ablated radial thumb are attached to the distal phalanx for more stability if necessary the extensor pollicis longus and the flexor pollicis longus are reattached to centralize their course  in wassel type 5 and 6 the opponens pollicis muscle must be transferred to the ulnar metacarpal soft tissue with collateral ligament reconstruction is used to avoid any angular deformity in the preserved thumb tendon centralization is also often used for correction still cases with osseous deformities may happen to provide alignment osteotomies are necessary to be done this operation may need bone grafting which is obtained from the amputated thumb  this type is indicated when one thumb is larger proximally and the other thumb has a larger distal component the procedure is initially described as a way to lengthen amputated digits the goal is to create a functional thumb by combining lesshypoplastic components on top plasty procedure is rarely employed in the treatment of congenital thumb duplication it is might be necessary for wassel types 4 5 6  at the level of the midproximal phalanx or midmetacarpal the distal component is transferred to the proximal component the tendons of the distal component are preserved as the rest of the distal component is amputated the neurovascular bundle which supplies the distal component is reserved and transferred proximally  early osteotomy and ligament reconstructions should be done to prevent deformities such as angular growth deformities  the surgical treatment of central polydactyly is highly variable after the surgery the hand must be functional and stable but also aesthetically pleasing this requires intraoperative creativity and flexibility the surgeon must also consider whether retention of a fully functional supranumerary digit is preferable to surgical intervention in contrast a functional fourfingered hand achieved via ray amputation may be preferable to a fivefingered hand with a deformed or stiff reconstructed finger  cases of polysyndactyly are approached through a standard opposing zigzag incision the incision is favored toward the accessory digit preserving extra skin for subsequent closure depending on the level and extent of duplication the flexor and extensor tendons may require centralization or rebalancing also the collateral ligaments must be preserved or reconstructed wide articular surfaces should be narrowed and phalangeal wedge osteotomies may be required to provide an axial alignment attention must also be given to reconstruct the intermetacarpal ligament furthermore one should take in mind the provision for adequate webspace soft tissue  there are no substantive outcome studies regarding the function of these hands following surgical intervention this is mainly caused by the fact that there is a generally normal function of these patients hands following ablation with collateral ligament reconstruction  in a study on 27 patients undergoing surgical excision for type a ulnar polydactyly only one complication was noted in the form of an infection  however no investigators have objectively reviewed functional range of motion or articular stability  in a study on 21 patients with type b ulnar polydactyly treated with suture ligation it was found that the duplicated digit was typically amputated at an average of 10 days and no complications of infection or bleeding were reported  in a large study on 105 patients treated with suture ligation an overall complication rate of 235 was reported citing a residual tender or unacceptable bump in 16 infection in 6 and bleeding in 1 of patients  in general suture ligation is safe and effective when applied to appropriate cases of type b polydactyly in which no substantial ligamentous or osseous structures are present within the pedicle parents should be educated as to the progression of necrosis and that revision of residual tissue or scar may be necessary when the child is 6 months of age or older  advantages by combining two hypoplastic thumbs a sufficient thumb size is acquired furthermore the ip and mcp joints are very stable as the collateral ligaments are not violated during reconstruction  disadvantages violation during reconstruction can lead to growth arrest or asymmetric growth nail deformity could also occur after reconstruction although the joint are stable restriction of flection may be possible  the average ip flexion in a reconstructed thumb is 55 degrees less than the contralateral thumb mcp flection averaged 55 degrees in reconstructed thumbs compared to 75 degrees in the contralateral thumb  advantages the reconstructed joints tend to remain flexible also it preserves the nail bed and physis this increases the prevention of nail deformities over time  disadvantages although surgeons try to obtain a stable thumb of appropriate size instability of the ip and mcp joint may occur as well as a size mismatch thumbs are defined as unacceptable if ip joint deviation exceeds 15 degrees mcp joint deviation exceeds 30 degrees and thumb size is inappropriate based on the examiners assessment also thumb size onethird greater or less than the contralateral thumb is defined as unacceptable  no surgical outcomes studies exist for evaluating the function of the thumbs after an ontop plasty reconstruction  few clinical outcome studies exist regarding the treatment of central polydactyly tada and colleagues note that satisfactory surgical correction of central polydactyly is difficult to achieve and that outcomes are generally poor in tadas study 12 patients were reviewed all patients required secondary surgical procedures to address flexion contractures and angular deviation at the ip joint level  however several primary factors contribute to the complexity of central polydactyly reconstruction hypoplastic joints and soft tissues that predispose the reconstructed finger to joint contracture and angular deformities as well as complex tendon anomalies are often difficult to address therefore treatment is wholly dependent on the anatomic components present the degree of syndactyly and the function of the duplicated finger  the condition has an incidence of 1 in every 500 live births  postaxial hand polydactyly is a common isolated disorder in african black children and autosomal dominant transmission is suspected postaxial polydactyly is more frequent in blacks than in whites and is more frequent in male children  in contrast postaxial polydactyly seen in white children is usually syndromic and associated with an autosomal recessive transmission one study by finley et al combined data from jefferson county alabama united states and uppsala county sweden this study showed incidence of all types of polydactyly to be 23 per 1000 in white males 06 per 1000 in white females 135 per 1000 in black males and 111 per 1000 in black females  cats normally have five digits on the front paws and four on the rear polydactyl cats have more and this is a moderately common condition especially in certain cat populations polydactyly is a common trait in several heritage chicken breeds including silkies a number of mutations of the lmbr1 gene in dogs humans and mice can cause polydactyly  a 2014 report indicated that mice could also exhibit polydactyly arising from mutation in the vps25 gene  dogs like other canids normally have four claws on their rear paws a fifth is often called a dewclaw and is especially found in certain dog breeds  including the norwegian lundehund and great pyrenees polydactyly was believed to be common in the earliest tetrapods the number of digits settling to the common five on each foot in amniotes and four to the hand and five to the foot in amphibians in the early carboniferous see polydactyly in early tetrapods

V madelungs deformity is usually characterized by malformed wrists and wrist bones accompanied by short stature and is often associated with lériweill dyschondrosteosis it has only been recognized within the past hundred years   leriweill dyschondrosteosis is a pseudoautosomal dominant disorder which occurs more frequently in females and is due to a mutation deletion or duplication of the shox gene the shox gene plays a particularly important role in the growth and maturation of bones in the arms and legs the shox gene is located within band xp223 of the pseudoautosomal region of the x chromosome which escapes xinactivation homozygous shox gene mutations result in langer mesomelic dysplasia  madelung deformity of the wrist is caused by a growth disturbance in the inferior volar part of the epiphysial growth plate in the distal radius resulting in a volar placed slope of the lunate facet and scaphoid facet this produces volar translation of the hand and wrist the ulna continues growing straight resulting in a dorsally prominent distal ulna it occurs predominantly in adolescent females who present with pain decreased range of motion and deformity it often has a genetic etiology and is associated with mesomelic dwarfism and a mutation on the x chromosome the deformity can be treated surgically by addressing the deforming bony and ligamentous lesions called vickers ligament this is an abnormal ligament formed between the lunate bone of the wrist and the radius and its found in 91 of cases of madelungs deformity it is a congenital subluxation or dislocation of the ulnas distal end due to malformation of the bones sometimes minor abnormalities of other bone structures often caused by disease or injury such as a fracture of the distal end of the radius with upward displacement of the distal fragment the deformity varies in degree from a slight protrusion of the lower end of the ulna to complete dislocation of the inferior radioulnar joint with marked radial deviation of the hand severe deformities are associated with congenital absence or hypoplasia of the radius the malefemale rate of this disorder is 14 the incidence is unknown and there is no described racial predominance even though madelungs deformity is considered a congenital disorder symptoms sometimes arent seen until adulthood in most cases symptoms find their onset during midchildhood at this age the relatively slower growth of the ulnar and palmar part of the radius leads to an increasingly progressive deformity pain and deformity are the main symptoms patients present with  typical clinical presentation consists of a short forearm anteriorulnar bow of the radius and a forward subluxation of the hand on the forearm as mentioned before the severity of the disorder varies greatly which also leads to a spectrum of presentation first options for treatment are conservative rest and nsaids at first if no improvement is made a splint or brace can be used to keep the deviated arm straight when none of the conservative treatments work surgical intervention is designated physiolysis purpose of the treatment is the removal of the epiphysis that causes the abnormal growth of the wrist this is done by making a small incision at the volarradial side this approach passes the flexor pollicis longus and palmaris longus and leaves the median nerve and radial artery protected then the pronator quadratus muscle is found and detached from the radius here a cut into the bone will find the abnormal epiphysis when the epiphysis is clearly defined more bone is removed so the radius is in its normal position and prevents a new bone bar from forming this is the end of the physiolisis this is always combined with a vickers ligament release  dome osteotomy purpose of this treatment option is to straighten the abnormal radius to do this an 8cm incision is made from the wrist crease at the palmair radial side the approach is made passing the flexor carpi radialis with detachment of the pronator quadratus muscle from the radius now the vickers ligament release is done after this the periosteum is elevated and a crescentshaped osteotomy concave at the end is marked on the bone now the radius is cut dome shaped and straightened the distal end of the radius stays attached to the ulna the dome shape of the osteotomy allows adequate bony contact for stability and a subperiosteal void for rapid healing  vickers ligament release this ligament causes the wrist to deform even more the purpose of this release is to release the tension and leave the wrist straight in further growth in both physiolysis and dome osteonomy there should be a clear view of the abnormal  ulna reduction adults with madelungs deformity may suffer from ulnarsided wrist pain madelungs deformity is usually treated by treating the distal radial deformity however if patients have a positive ulnar variance and focal wrist pathology its possible to treat with an isolated ulnarshortening osteotomy in these patients the radial deformity is not treated  the ulna is approached from the subcutaneous border a plate is attached to the distal end of the ulna to plan the osteotomy an oblique segment is removed from the ulna after which the distal radialulnar joint is freed making sure structures stay attached to the styloid process after this the freed distal end is reattached to the proximal ulna with the formerly mentioned plate  total druj replacement an alternative treatment for patients with ulnarsided wristpain is a total replacement of the distal radialulnar joint there are many surgical treatments of the condition but most of these only improve the alignment and function of the radiocarpal joint a persistent problem in these treatments has been the stiff druj however a prosthesis helps in managing the pain and might also improve the range of motion of the wrist  the procedure consists of making a hockeystick shaped incision along the ulnar border this incision is made between the fifth and sixth dorsal compartment being careful not to harm any essential structures like the posterior interosseous nerve the incision is continued between the extensor carpi ulnaris and the extensor digiti quinti until the ulna is found the ulnar head is then removed a guide wire is then inserted in the medullary canal of the ulna allowing centralization for a cannulated drill bit a polyethylene ball which will serve as the prosthesis is then placed over the distal peg after confirming full range of motion the skin will be closed  dome osteotomy in case of madelungs deformity in conjunction with radial pain a dome osteotomy may be conducted for more information about this procedure please refer to the treatment of madelungs deformity in children it is named for otto wilhelm madelung   further internet resources on madelungs deformity 1

V congenital amputation is birth without a limb or limbs or without a part of a limb or limbs it is known to be caused by blood clots forming in the fetus while in utero vascular insult and from amniotic band syndrome fibrous bands of the amnion that constrict foetal limbs to such an extent that they fail to form or actually fall off due to missing blood supply congenital amputation can also occur due to maternal exposure to teratogens during pregnancy   congenital amputation is the least common reason for amputation but it is projected  that one in 2000 babies are born each year with a missing or deformed limb during certain periods in history an increase in congenital amputations has been documented one example includes the thalidomide tragedy that occurred in the 1960s when pregnant mothers were given a tranquilizer that contained the harmful drug which produced an increase in children born without limbs another example was the chernobyl catastrophe in russia where the radiation exposure caused many children to be born with abnormal or missing limbs the exact cause of congenital amputation is unknown and can result from a number of causes however most cases show that the first three months in a pregnancy are when most birth defects occur because that is when the organs of the fetus are beginning to form one common cause is amniotic band syndrome which occurs when the inner fetal membrane amnion ruptures without injury to the outer membrane chorion fibrous bands from the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can get entangled with the fetus thus reducing blood supply to the developing limbs to such an extent that the limbs can become strangulated the tissues die and are absorbed into the amniotic fluid a baby with congenital amputation can be missing a portion of a limb or the entire limb which results in the complete absence of a limb beyond a certain point where only a stump is left is known as transverse deficiency or amelia when a specific part is missing it is referred to as longitudinal deficiency finally phocomelia occurs when only a midportion of a limb is missing for example when the hands or feet are directly attached to the trunk of the body amnion ruptures can be caused by for most cases the diagnosis for congenital amputation is not made until the infant is born one procedure that is helpful in determining this condition in an infant is an ultrasound examination of a fetus when still in the mothers abdomen as it can reveal the absence of a limb however since ultrasounds are routine they may not pick up all the signs of some of the more subtle birth defects the most popular method of treatment for congenital amputation is having the child be fit for a prosthesis which can lead to normal development so the muscles dont atrophy if there is congenital amputation of the fingers plastic surgery can be performed by using the big toe or second toes in place of the missing fingers of the hand  in rare cases of amniotic banding syndrome if diagnosed in utero fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation studies suggest that prenatal care for mothers during their pregnancies can prevent congenital amputation  knowing environmental and genetic risks is also important heavy exposure to chemicals smoking alcohol poor diet or engaging in any other teratogenic activities while pregnant can increase the risk of having a child born with a congenital amputation folic acid is a multivitamin that has been found to reduce birth defects  the term congenital amputation is sometimes used loosely to mean congenital absence

V benzene is an important organic chemical compound with the chemical formula c6h6 its molecule is composed of 6 carbon atoms joined in a ring with 1 hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom because its molecules contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil and is one of the most elementary petrochemicals benzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon and the second nannulene 6annulene a cyclic hydrocarbon with a continuous pi bond it is sometimes abbreviated phh benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell it is mainly used as a precursor to heavy chemicals such as ethylbenzene and cumene which are produced on a billion kilogram scale because it has a high octane number it is an important component of gasoline comprising a few percent of its mass most nonindustrial applications have been limited by benzenes carcinogenicity   the word benzene derives historically from gum benzoin benzoin resin an aromatic resin known to european pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th century as a product of southeast asia  an acidic material was derived from benzoin by sublimation and named flowers of benzoin or benzoic acid the hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin benzol or benzene  michael faraday first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen   in 1833 eilhard mitscherlich produced it via the distillation of benzoic acid from gum benzoin and lime he gave the compound the name benzin  in 1836 the french chemist auguste laurent named the substance phène  this is the root of the word phenol which is hydroxylated benzene and phenyl which is the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom free radical h from benzene in 1845 charles mansfield working under august wilhelm von hofmann isolated benzene from coal tar  four years later mansfield began the first industrialscale production of benzene based on the coaltar method   gradually the sense developed among chemists that substances related to benzene represent a diverse chemical family in 1855 hofmann used the word aromatic to designate this family relationship after a characteristic property of many of its members  in 1997 benzene was detected in deep space  the empirical formula for benzene was long known but its highly polyunsaturated structure with just one hydrogen atom for each carbon atom was challenging to determine archibald scott couper in 1858 and joseph loschmidt in 1861  suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings but too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure in 1865 the german chemist friedrich august kekulé published a paper in french for he was then teaching in francophone belgium suggesting that the structure contained a sixmembered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds the next year he published a much longer paper in german on the same subject   kekulé used evidence that had accumulated in the intervening yearsnamely that there always appeared to be only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene and that there always appeared to be exactly three isomers of every disubstituted derivativenow understood to correspond to the ortho meta and para patterns of arene substitutionto argue in support of his proposed structure  kekulés symmetrical ring could explain these curious facts as well as benzenes 11 carbonhydrogen ratio  the new understanding of benzene and hence of all aromatic compounds proved to be so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in 1890 the german chemical society organized an elaborate appreciation in kekulés honor celebrating the twentyfifth anniversary of his first benzene paper here kekulé spoke of the creation of the theory he said that he had discovered the ring shape of the benzene molecule after having a reverie or daydream of a snake seizing its own tail this is a common symbol in many ancient cultures known as the ouroboros or endless knot  this vision he said came to him after years of studying the nature of carboncarbon bonds this was 7 years after he had solved the problem of how carbon atoms could bond to up to four other atoms at the same time it is curious that a similar humorous depiction of benzene had appeared in 1886 in the berichte der durstigen chemischen gesellschaft journal of the thirsty chemical society a parody of the berichte der deutschen chemischen gesellschaft only the parody had monkeys seizing each other in a circle rather than snakes as in kekulés anecdote  some historians have suggested that the parody was a lampoon of the snake anecdote possibly already well known through oral transmission even if it had not yet appeared in print  some others have speculated that kekulés story in 1890 was a reparody of the monkey spoof and was a mere invention rather than a recollection of an event in his life  kekulés 1890 speech  in which these anecdotes appeared has been translated into english  if the anecdote is the memory of a real event circumstances mentioned in the story suggest that it must have happened early in 1862  the cyclic nature of benzene was finally confirmed by the crystallographer kathleen lonsdale in 1929   the first use of the prefixes ortho meta para to distinguish disubstituted benzene derivatives was by the german chemist wilhelm körner in 1867 however he did not use the prefixes to distinguish the relative positions of the substituents on a benzene ring  it was the german chemist karl gräbe who in 1869 first used the prefixes ortho meta para to denote specific relative locations of the substituents on a disubstituted aromatic ring viz naphthalene  in 1870 the german chemist viktor meyer first applied gräbes nomenclature to benzene  in the 19th and early20th centuries benzene was used as an aftershave lotion because of its pleasant smell prior to the 1920s benzene was frequently used as an industrial solvent especially for degreasing metal as its toxicity became obvious benzene was supplanted by other solvents especially toluene methyl benzene which has similar physical properties but is not as carcinogenic in 1903 ludwig roselius popularized the use of benzene to decaffeinate coffee this discovery led to the production of sanka this process was later discontinued benzene was historically used as a significant component in many consumer products such as liquid wrench several paint strippers rubber cements spot removers and other hydrocarboncontaining products some ceased manufacture of their benzenecontaining formulations in about 1950 while others continued to use benzene as a component or significant contaminant until the late 1970s when leukemia deaths were found associated with goodyears pliofilm production operations in ohio until the late 1970s many hardware stores paint stores and other retail outlets sold benzene in small cans such as quart size for generalpurpose use many students were exposed to benzene in school and university courses while performing laboratory experiments with little or no ventilation in many cases this dangerous practice has been almost totally eliminated trace amounts of benzene are found in petroleum and coal it is a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of many materials for commercial use until world war ii most benzene was obtained as a byproduct of coke production or cokeoven light oil for the steel industry however in the 1950s increased demand for benzene especially from the growing polymers industry necessitated the production of benzene from petroleum today most benzene comes from the petrochemical industry with only a small fraction being produced from coal  xray diffraction shows that all six carboncarbon bonds in benzene are of the same length at 140 picometres pm the cc bond lengths are greater than a double bond 135 pm but shorter than a single bond 147 pm this intermediate distance is consistent with electron delocalization the electrons for cc bonding are distributed equally between each of the six carbon atoms benzene has 6 hydrogen atoms  fewer than the corresponding parent alkane hexane the molecule is planar  the mo description involves the formation of three delocalized \u03c0 orbitals spanning all six carbon atoms while the vb description involves a superposition of resonance structures     it is likely that this stability contributes to the peculiar molecular and chemical properties known as aromaticity to accurately reflect the nature of the bonding benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms derivatives of benzene occur sufficiently often as a component of organic molecules that there is a unicode symbol in the miscellaneous technical block with the code u232c  to represent it with three double bonds  and u23e3  for a delocalized version  many important chemical compounds are derived from benzene by replacing one or more of its hydrogen atoms with another functional group examples of simple benzene derivatives are phenol toluene and aniline abbreviated phoh phme and phnh2 respectively linking benzene rings gives biphenyl c6h5c6h5 further loss of hydrogen gives fused aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene and anthracene the limit of the fusion process is the hydrogenfree allotrope of carbon graphite in heterocycles carbon atoms in the benzene ring are replaced with other elements the most important derivatives are the rings containing nitrogen replacing one ch with n gives the compound pyridine c5h5n although benzene and pyridine are structurally related benzene cannot be converted into pyridine replacement of a second ch bond with n gives depending on the location of the second n pyridazine pyrimidine and pyrazine four chemical processes contribute to industrial benzene production catalytic reforming toluene hydrodealkylation toluene disproportionation and steam cracking according to the atsdr toxicological profile for benzene between 1978 and 1981 catalytic reformats accounted for approximately 4450 of the total us benzene production  in catalytic reforming a mixture of hydrocarbons with boiling points between 60200c is blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed to a bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at 500525c and pressures ranging from 850 atm under these conditions aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons the aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture or reformate by extraction with any one of a number of solvents including diethylene glycol or sulfolane and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation the extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest nonaromatic components recovery of the aromatics commonly referred to as btx benzene toluene and xylene isomers involves such extraction and distillation steps there are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics in similar fashion to this catalytic reforming uop and bp commercialized a method from lpg mainly propane and butane to aromatics toluene hydrodealkylation converts toluene to benzene in this hydrogenintensive process toluene is mixed with hydrogen then passed over a chromium molybdenum or platinum oxide catalyst at 500600c and 4060 atm pressure sometimes higher temperatures are used instead of a catalyst at the similar reaction condition under these conditions toluene undergoes dealkylation to benzene and methane this irreversible reaction is accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction that produces biphenyl aka diphenyl at higher temperature if the raw material stream contains much nonaromatic components paraffins or naphthenes those are likely decomposed to lower hydrocarbons such as methane which increases the consumption of hydrogen a typical reaction yield exceeds 95 sometimes xylenes and heavier aromatics are used in place of toluene with similar efficiency this is often called onpurpose methodology to produce benzene compared to conventional btx benzenetoluenexylene extraction processes where a chemical complex has similar demands for both benzene and xylene then toluene disproportionation tdp may be an attractive alternative to the toluene hydrodealkylation in the broad sense 2 toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule to the other yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule given that demand for paraxylene pxylene substantially exceeds demand for other xylene isomers a refinement of the tdp process called selective tdp stdp may be used in this process the xylene stream exiting the tdp unit is approximately 90 paraxylene in some current catalytic systems even the benzenetoxylenes ratio is decreased more xylenes when the demand of xylenes is higher steam cracking is the process for producing ethylene and other alkenes from aliphatic hydrocarbons depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins steam cracking can produce a benzenerich liquid byproduct called pyrolysis gasoline pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive or routed through an extraction process to recover btx aromatics benzene toluene and xylenes although of no commercial significance many other routes to benzene exist phenol and halobenzenes can be reduced with metals for example benzoic acid and its salts undergo decarboxylation to benzene via the reaction the diazonium compound with hypophosphorus acid aniline gives benzene trimerization of acetylene gives benzene benzene is used mainly as an intermediate to make other chemicals above all ethylbenzene cumene cyclohexane nitrobenzene and alkylbenzene more than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene a precursor to styrene which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and eps some 20 of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives cyclohexane consumes ca 10 of the worlds benzene production it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers lubricants dyes detergents drugs explosives and pesticides in 2013 the biggest consumer country of benzene was china followed by the usa benzene production is currently expanded in the middle east and in africa whereas capacities in western europe and north america stagnate  toluene is now often used as a substitute for benzene for instance as a fuel additive the solventproperties of the two are similar but toluene is less toxic and has a wider liquid range toluene is also processed into benzene  as a gasoline petrol additive benzene increases the octane rating and reduces knocking as a consequence gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s when tetraethyl lead replaced it as the most widely used antiknock additive with the global phaseout of leaded gasoline benzene has made a comeback as a gasoline additive in some nations in the united states concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzenes entering the groundwater have led to stringent regulation of gasolines benzene content with limits typically around 1  european petrol specifications now contain the same 1 limit on benzene content the united states environmental protection agency introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 062  the most common reactions of benzene involve substitution of a proton by other groups  electrophilic aromatic substitution is a general method of derivatizing benzene benzene is sufficiently nucleophilic that it undergoes substitution by acylium ions and alkyl carbocations to give substituted derivatives the most widely practiced example of this reaction is the ethylation of benzene approximately 24700000 tons were produced in 1999  highly instructive but of far less industrial significance is the friedelcrafts alkylation of benzene and many other aromatic rings using an alkyl halide in the presence of a strong lewis acid catalyst similarly the friedelcrafts acylation is a related example of electrophilic aromatic substitution the reaction involves the acylation of benzene or many other aromatic rings with an acyl chloride using a strong lewis acid catalyst such as aluminium chloride or ironiii chloride using electrophilic aromatic substitution many functional groups are introduced onto the benzene framework sulfonation of benzene involves the use of oleum a mixture of sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide sulfonated benzene derivatives are useful detergents in nitration benzene reacts with nitronium ions no2  which is a strong electrophile produced by combining sulfuric and nitric acids nitrobenzene is the precursor to aniline chlorination is achieved with chlorine to give chlorobenzene in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminium trichloride via hydrogenation benzene and its derivatives convert to cyclohexane and derivatives this reaction is achieved by the use of high pressures of hydrogen at high temperatures in the presence of a finely divided nickel which serves as a catalyst in the absence of the catalyst benzene is impervious to hydrogen this reaction is practiced on a very large scale industrially benzene is an excellent ligand in the organometallic chemistry of lowvalent metals important examples include the sandwich and halfsandwich complexes respectively crc6h62 and rucl2c6h62 benzene increases the risk of cancer and other illnesses benzene is a notorious cause of bone marrow failure substantial quantities of epidemiologic clinical and laboratory data link benzene to aplastic anemia acute leukemia and bone marrow abnormalities   the specific hematologic malignancies that benzene is associated with include acute myeloid leukemia aml aplastic anemia myelodysplastic syndrome mds acute lymphoblastic leukemia all and chronic myeloid leukemia cml  the american petroleum institute api stated in 1948 that it is generally considered that the only absolutely safe concentration for benzene is zero  the us department of health and human services dhhs classifies benzene as a human carcinogen longterm exposure to excessive levels of benzene in the air causes leukemia a potentially fatal cancer of the bloodforming organs in particular acute myeloid leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia aml  anll is not disputed to be caused by benzene  iarc rated benzene as known to be carcinogenic to humans group 1 because benzene is ubiquitous in gasoline and hydrocarbon fuels are in use everywhere human exposure to benzene is a global health problem benzene targets liver kidney lung heart and the brain and can cause dna strand breaks chromosomal damage etc benzene causes cancer in animals including humans benzene has been shown to cause cancer in both sexes of multiple species of laboratory animals exposed via various routes   some women who inhaled high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries benzene exposure has been linked directly to the neural birth defects spina bifida and anencephaly  men exposed to high levels of benzene are more likely to have an abnormal amount of chromosomes in their sperm which impacts fertility and fetal development  according to the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2007 benzene is both an anthropogenically produced and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include volcanic eruptions wild fires synthesis of chemicals such as phenol production of synthetic fibers and fabrication of rubbers lubricants pesticides medications and dyes the major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke automobile service stations exhaust from motor vehicles and industrial emissions however ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes which are then analyzed with a gas chromatograph the measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine blood and breath tests however all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body  osha regulates levels of benzene in the workplace  the maximum allowable amount of benzene in workroom air during an 8hour workday 40hour workweek is 1 ppm because benzene can cause cancer niosh recommends that all workers wear special breathing equipment when they are likely to be exposed to benzene at levels exceeding the recommended 8hour exposure limit of 01 ppm  the united states environmental protection agency has set a maximum contaminant level mcl for benzene in drinking water at 0005mgl 5 ppb as promulgated via the us national primary drinking water regulations  this regulation is based on preventing benzene leukemogenesis the maximum contaminant level goal mclg a nonenforceable health goal that would allow an adequate margin of safety for the prevention of adverse effects is zero benzene concentration in drinking water the epa requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of 10 pounds 45kg or more of benzene be reported the us occupational safety and health administration osha has set a permissible exposure limit of 1 part of benzene per million parts of air 1 ppm in the workplace during an 8hour workday 40hour workweek the short term exposure limit for airborne benzene is 5 ppm for 15 minutes  these legal limits were based on studies demonstrating compelling evidence of health risk to workers exposed to benzene the risk from exposure to 1 ppm for a working lifetime has been estimated as 5 excess leukemia deaths per 1000 employees exposed this estimate assumes no threshold for benzenes carcinogenic effects osha has also established an action level of 05 ppm to encourage even lower exposures in the workplace  the us national institute for occupational safety and health niosh revised the immediately dangerous to life and health idlh concentration for benzene to 500 ppm the current niosh definition for an idlh condition as given in the niosh respirator selection logic is one that poses a threat of exposure to airborne contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an environment niosh 2004 the purpose of establishing an idlh value is 1 to ensure that the worker can escape from a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of the respiratory protection equipment and 2 is considered a maximum level above which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus providing maximum worker protection is permitted niosh 2004   in september 1995 niosh issued a new policy for developing recommended exposure limits rels for substances including carcinogens because benzene can cause cancer niosh recommends that all workers wear special breathing equipment when they are likely to be exposed to benzene at levels exceeding the rel 10hour of 01 ppm  the niosh shortterm exposure limit stel  15 min is 1 ppm american conference of governmental industrial hygienists acgih adopted threshold limit values tlvs for benzene at 05 ppm twa and 25 ppm stel several tests can determine exposure to benzene benzene itself can be measured in breath blood or urine but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours postexposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation most persons in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood in the body benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including muconic acid phenylmercapturic acid phenol catechol hydroquinone and 124trihydroxybenzene most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased the current acgih biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 \u03bcgg creatinine for muconic acid and 25 \u03bcgg creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an endofshift urine specimen     even if it is not a common substrate for the metabolism benzene can be oxidized by both bacteria and eukaryotes in bacteria dioxygenase enzyme can add an oxygen to the ring and the unstable product is immediately reduced by nadh to a cyclic diol with two double bonds breaking the aromaticity next the diol is newly reduced by nadh to catechol the catechol is then metabolized to acetyl coa and succinyl coa used by organisms mainly in the krebs cycle for energy production the pathway for the metabolism of benzene is complex and begins in the liver several enzymes are involved these include cytochrome p450 2e1 cyp2e1 quinine oxidoreductase nq01 gsh and myeloperoxidase mpo cyp2e1 is involved at multiple steps converting benzene to oxepin benzene oxide phenol to hydroquinone and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and catechol hydroquinone benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols in the bone marrow mpo converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones these intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase ii which maintains chromosome structure disruption of microtubules which maintains cellular structure and organization generation of oxygen free radicals unstable species that may lead to point mutations increasing oxidative stress inducing dna strand breaks and altering dna methylation which can affect gene expression nq01 and gsh shift metabolism away from toxicity nq01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols counteracting the effect of mpo gsh is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid   genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes may induce loss of function or gain of function for example mutations in cyp2e1 increase activity and result in increased generation of toxic metabolites nq01 mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased detoxification myeloperoxidase mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased generation of toxic metabolites gsh mutations or deletions result in loss of function and result in decreased detoxification these genes may be targets for genetic screening for susceptibility to benzene toxicity  the paradigm of toxicological assessment of benzene is shifting towards the domain of molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way glutathione seems to play an important role by protecting against benzeneinduced dna breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect  benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure these aberrations can be monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization fish with dna probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity  benzene metabolism involves enzymes coded for by polymorphic genes studies have shown that genotype at these loci may influence susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene exposure individuals carrying variant of nadphquinone oxidoreductase 1 nqo1 microsomal epoxide hydrolase ephx and deletion of the glutathione stransferase t1 gstt1 showed a greater frequency of dna singlestranded breaks  one way of understanding the carcinogenic effects of benzene is by examining the products of biological oxidation pure benzene for example oxidizes in the body to produce an epoxide benzene oxide which is not excreted readily and can interact with dna to produce harmful mutations outdoor air may contain low levels of benzene from automobile service stations wood smoke tobacco smoke the transfer of gasoline exhaust from motor vehicles and industrial emissions  about 50 of the entire nationwide united states exposure to benzene results from smoking tobacco or from exposure to tobacco smoke  inhaled benzene is primarily expelled unchanged through exhalation in a human study 164 to 416 of retained benzene was eliminated through the lungs within five to seven hours after a two to threehour exposure to 47 to 110 ppm and only 007 to 02 of the remaining benzene was excreted unchanged in the urine after exposure to 63 to 405mgm3 of benzene for 1 to 5 hours 51 to 87 was excreted in the urine as phenol over a period of 23 to 50 hours in another human study 30 of absorbed dermally applied benzene which is primarily metabolized in the liver was excreted as phenol in the urine  exposure of the general population to benzene occurs mainly through breathing the major sources of benzene being tobacco smoke as well as automobile service stations exhaust from motor vehicles and industrial emissions about 20 altogether according to the cdc the mean number of cigarettes per day cpd among daily smokers in 1993 was 196 213 cpd for men and 178 cpd for women and in 2004 was 168 181 cpd for men and 153 cpd for women  according to the august 2007 public health statement the average smoker smokes 32 cpd which in turn the average smoker would take in about 18 milligrams mg of benzene per day this amount is about 10 times the average daily intake of benzene by nonsmokers  under specific conditions and in the presence of other chemicals benzoic acid a preservative and ascorbic acid vitamin c may interact to produce benzene in march 2006 the official food standards agency in britain conducted a survey of 150 brands of soft drinks it found that four contained benzene levels above world health organization limits the affected batches were removed from sale  in 2005 the water supply to the city of harbin in china with a population of almost nine million people was cut off because of a major benzene exposure benzene leaked into the songhua river which supplies drinking water to the city after an explosion at a china

V tetraamelia syndrome tetra  amelia also called autosomal recessive tetraamelia  is an extremely rare autosomal recessive  congenital disorder characterized by the absence of all four limbs other areas of the body are also affected by malformations such as the face skull reproductive organs anus and pelvis  the disorder is caused by mutations in the wnt3 gene  australian motivational speaker nick vujicic and japanese author and sports journalist hirotada ototake are survivors of the syndrome   tetraamelia syndrome is characterized by the complete absence of all four limbs the syndrome causes severe malformations of various parts of the body including the face and head heart nervous system skeleton and genitalia in many cases the lungs are underdeveloped which makes breathing difficult or impossible because children with tetraamelia syndrome have such serious medical problems most are stillborn or die shortly after birth researchers have found a mutation in the wnt3 gene in people with tetraamelia syndrome from one large family this gene is part of a family of wnt genes that play critical roles in development before birth the wnt3 gene is located at human chromosome 17q21  the protein produced from the wnt3 gene is involved in the formation of the limbs and other body systems during embryonic development mutations in the wnt3 gene prevent cells from producing functional wnt3 protein which disrupts normal limb formation and leads to the other serious birth defects associated with tetraamelia syndrome in some affected families the cause of tetraamelia syndrome has not been determined some researchers believe that unidentified mutations in wnt3 or other genes involved in limb development may be responsible for the disorder in most of the families reported so far tetraamelia syndrome appears to have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance   this means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome chromosome 17 is an autosome and two copies of the defective gene one inherited from each parent are required in order to be born with the disorder the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder tetraamelia syndrome has been reported in only a few families worldwide according to a 2011 study by bermejosanchez tetroamelia occurs in roughly 1 out of every 71000 pregnancies

V scoliosis \u02ccsk\u0252l\u026a\u02c8o\u028as\u026as  from ancientgreek \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2skoliosisbending  is a common medical condition in which a persons spinal axis has a threedimensional deviation  although it is a complex threedimensional condition on an xray viewed from the rear the spine of an individual with scoliosis can resemble an s or a c rather than a straight line  scoliosis is typically classified as either congenital caused by vertebral anomalies present at birth idiopathic cause unknown subclassified as infantile juvenile adolescent or adult according to when onset occurred or secondary to a primary condition  secondary scoliosis can be the result of a neuromuscular condition eg spina bifida cerebral palsy spinal muscular atrophy or physical trauma or syndromes such as chiari malformation  recent longitudinal studies reveal that the most common form of the condition lateonset idiopathic scoliosis causes little physical impairment other than back pain and cosmetic concerns even when untreated with mortality rates similar to the general population   older beliefs that untreated idiopathic scoliosis necessarily progresses into severe cardiopulmonary disability by old age have been refuted by later studies  the rarer forms of scoliosis pose risks of complications such as heart and lung problems scoliosis is a lifelong condition management of the condition includes treatments such as bracing physical therapy and surgery people having reached skeletal maturity are less likely to have a worsening case some severe cases of scoliosis can lead to diminishing lung capacity putting pressure on the heart and restricting physical activities the signs of scoliosis can include scoliosis is sometimes associated with other conditions such as ehlersdanlos syndrome hyperflexibility floppy baby syndrome and other variants of the condition charcotmarietooth disease praderwilli syndrome osteogenesis imperfecta kyphosis cerebral palsy spinal muscular atrophy muscular dystrophy familial dysautonomia charge syndrome friedreichs ataxia fragile x syndrome   proteus syndrome spina bifida marfans syndrome nailpatella syndrome neurofibromatosis connective tissue disorders congenital diaphragmatic hernia hemihypertrophy and craniospinal axis disorders eg syringomyelia mitral valve prolapse arnoldchiari malformation and amniotic band syndrome it is also associated with loeysdietz syndrome scoliosis associated with known syndromes such as marfans or praderwilli is often subclassified as syndromic scoliosis pain in the lower or upper shoulder blade neck and buttock pain nearest bottom of the back nerve pinching of the leg may cause the legs to cut out among females painful menstruation dysmenorrhea might be prevalent due to a secondary pelvic tilt there are many causes of scoliosis including congenital spine deformities those present at birth either inherited or caused by the environment neuromuscular problems genetic conditions and limb length inequality other causes for scoliosis include cerebral palsy spina bifida muscular dystrophy spinal muscular atrophy and tumors  an estimated 65 of scoliosis cases are idiopathic about 15 are congenital and about 10 are secondary to a neuromuscular disease  adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ais has no clear causal agent and is generally believed to be multifactorial although genetics are believed to play a role   the prevalence of scoliosis is 1 to 2 among adolescents however the likelihood of progression among adolescents with a cobb angle of less than 20 is about 10 to 20  at least one gene chd7 has been associated with the idiopathic form of scoliosis  studies in 2006 showed evidence of a linkage between idiopathic scoliosis and three microsatellite polymorphisms in the matn1 gene encoding for matrilin 1 cartilage matrix protein respectively consisting of 103 101 and 99 base pairs  congenital scoliosis can be attributed to a malformation of the spine during weeks three to six in utero it is a result of either a failure of formation a failure of segmentation or a combination of stimuli  this incomplete and abnormal segmentation results in an abnormally shaped vertebra at times fused to a normal vertebra or unilaterally fused vertebrae leading to the abnormal lateral curvature of the spine  secondary scoliosis due to neuropathic and myopathic conditions can result in a loss of muscular support for the spinal column which results in the spinal column being pulled in abnormal directions some conditions which may cause secondary scoliosis include muscular dystrophy spinal muscular atrophy poliomyelitis cerebral palsy spinal cord trauma and myotonia   scoliosis often presents itself or worsens during the adolescence growth spurt and is more often diagnosed in females than males  scoliosis is commonly marked by calcium deposits ectopic calcification in the cartilage endplate and sometimes in the disc itself  scoliosis is defined as a spinal curvature of more than 10 degrees to the right or left as the examiner faces the patient in the coronal plane deformity may also exist to the front or back in the sagittal plane patients who initially present with scoliosis are examined to determine whether the deformity has an underlying cause during a physical examination the following are assessed to exclude the possibility of underlying condition more serious than simple scoliosis the patients gait is assessed and there is an exam for signs of other abnormalities eg spina bifida as evidenced by a dimple hairy patch lipoma or hemangioma a thorough neurological examination is also performed the skin for café au lait spots indicative of neurofibromatosis the feet for cavovarus deformity abdominal reflexes and muscle tone for spasticity during the examination the patient is asked to bend forward as far as possible this is known as the adams forward bend test  and is often performed on school students if a prominence is noted then scoliosis is a possibility and the patient should be sent for an xray to confirm the diagnosis as an alternative a scoliometer may be used to diagnose the condition  when scoliosis is suspected weightbearing fullspine apcoronal frontback view and lateralsagittal side view xrays are usually taken to assess the scoliosis curves and the kyphosis and lordosis as these can also be affected in individuals with scoliosis fulllength standing spine xrays are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of the scoliosis and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature in growing individuals serial radiographs are obtained at three to 12month intervals to follow curve progression and in some instances mri investigation is warranted to look at the spinal cord  the standard method for assessing the curvature quantitatively is measurement of the cobb angle which is the angle between two lines drawn perpendicular to the upper endplate of the uppermost vertebra involved and the lower endplate of the lowest vertebra involved for patients with two curves cobb angles are followed for both curves in some patients lateralbending xrays are obtained to assess the flexibility of the curves or the primary and compensatory curves  genetic testing for ais which became available in 2009 and is still under investigation attempts to gauge the likelihood of curve progression  through a genomewide association study geneticists have identified single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the dna that are significantly associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis fiftythree genetic markers have been identified scoliosis has been described as a biomechanical deformity the progression of which depends on asymmetric forces otherwise known as the heutervolkmann law  the traditional medical management of scoliosis is complex and is determined by the severity of the curvature and skeletal maturity which together help predict the likelihood of progression the conventional options for children and adolescents are  for adults treatment usually focuses on relieving any pain   treatment for idiopathic scoliosis also depends upon the severity of the curvature the spines potential for further growth and the risk that the curvature will progress mild scoliosis less than 30 degrees deviation may simply be monitored and treated with exercise moderately severe scoliosis 3045 degrees in a child who is still growing may require bracing severe curvatures that rapidly progress may be treated surgically with spinal rod placement bracing may prevent a progressive curvature but evidence for this is not very strong in all cases early intervention offers the best results a growing body of scientific research testifies to the efficacy of specialized treatment programs of physical therapy which may include bracing  a physical therapist helps those who have experienced an injury or illness regain or maintain the ability to participate in everyday activities for those with scoliosis a physical therapist can provide assistance through assessment intervention and ongoing evaluation of the condition this helps them manage physical symptoms so they can participate in daily activities like selfcare productivity and leisure one intervention involves bracing during the past several decades a large variety of bracing devices have been developed for the treatment of scoliosis  studies demonstrate that preventing force sideways across a joint by bracing prevents further curvature of the spine in idiopathic scoliosis  while other studies have also shown that braces can be used by individuals with scoliosis during physical activities  other interventions include postural strategies such as posture training in sitting standing and sleeping positions and in using positioning supports such as pillows wedges rolls and corsets  adaptive and compensatory strategies are also employed to help facilitate individuals to returning daily activities strengthening spinal muscles is a crucial preventive measure this is because the muscles in the back are essential when it comes to supporting the spinal column and maintaining the spines proper shape exercises that will help improve the strength of the muscles in the back include rows and leg and arm extensions  elastic resistance exercise may also be able to sustain the progression of spinal curvature  this type of exercise is able to sustain progression by equalizing the strength of the torso muscles found on each side of the body disability caused by scoliosis as well as physical limitations during recovery from treatmentrelated surgery often affects an individuals ability to perform selfcare activities  one of the first treatments of scoliosis is the attempt to prevent further curvature of the spine depending on the size of the curvature this is typically done in one of three ways bracing surgery or postural positioning through customized cushioning    stopping the progression of the scoliosis can prevent the loss of function in many activities of daily living by maintaining range of motion preventing deformity of the rib cage and reducing pain during activities such as bending or lifting occupational therapists are often involved in the process of selection and fabrication of customized cushions these individualized postural supports are used to maintain the current spinal curvature or they can be adjusted to assist in the correction of the curvature this type of treatment can help to maintain mobility for a wheelchair user by preventing the deformity of the rib cage and maintaining an active range of motion in the arms  for other selfcare activities such as dressing bathing grooming personal hygiene and feeding several strategies can be used as a part of occupational therapy treatment environmental adaptations for bathing could include a bath bench grab bars installed in the shower area or a handheld shower nozzle  for activities such as dressing and grooming various assistive devices and strategies can be used to promote independence an occupational therapist may recommend a longhandled reacher that can be used to assist selfdressing by allowing a person to avoid painful movements such as bending over a longhandled shoehorn can be used for putting on and removing shoes problems with activities such as cutting meat and eating can be addressed by using specialized cutlery kitchen utensils or dishes productive activities include paid or unpaid work household chores school and play  recent studies in healthcare have led to the development of a variety of treatments to assist in the management of scoliosis thereby maximizing productivity for people of all ages assistive technology has undergone dramatic changes over the past 20 years the availability and quality of the technology has improved greatly  as a result of using assistive technology functional changes may range from improvements in abilities performance in daily activities participation levels and quality of life  a common assistive technology intervention is specialized seating and postural control for children with poor postural control a comfortable seating system that provides them with the support needed to maintain a sitting position can be essential for raising their overall level of wellbeing  a childs wellbeing in a productive sense involves the ability to participate in classroom and play activities  specialized wheelchair seating has been identified as the most common prescription in the management of scoliosis in teenagers with muscular dystrophy  with comfortable wheelchair seating teenagers are able to participate in classroom activities for longer periods with less fatigue by tilting the seating position 20 forward toward the thighs seating pressure is significantly redistributed so sitting is more comfortable if an office worker with scoliosis can sit for longer periods increased work output is likely to occur and could improve quality of life tall forwardsloping seats or front parts of seats and when possible with tall desk with the opposite slope can in general reduce pains and the need of bending significantly while working or studying and that is particularly important with braced fragile or tender backs an open hip angle can benefit the used lung volume and respiration   for those not using a wheelchair bracing may be used to treat scoliosis lifestyle changes are made to compensate for the proper use of spine braces physical symptoms such as chest pains back pains shortness of breath and limited spinal movement can hamper or preclude participation in leisure activities of a physical nature the occupational therapists role is to facilitate participation by helping the patient manage these symptoms bracing is a common strategy recommended by an occupational therapist in particular for individuals engaging in sports and exercise  an ot is responsible for educating an individual on the advantages and disadvantages of different braces proper ways to wear the brace and the daytoday care of the brace to help a person manage heart and lung symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pains an occupational therapist can teach the individual energy conservation techniques  this includes scheduling routine breaks during the activity as suitable for the individual for example an occupational therapist can recommend that a swimmer take breaks between laps to conserve energy adapting or modifying the exercise or sport is another way a person with scoliosis can do it  adapting the activity may change the difficulty of the sport or exercise for example it might mean taking breaks throughout an exercise if a person with scoliosis is unable to participate in a sport or exercise an ot can help the individual explore other physical activities that are suitable to hisher interests and capabilities an occupational therapist and the person with scoliosis can explore enjoyable and meaningful participation in the sportexercise in another capacity such as coaching or refereeing bracing is normally done when the patient has bone growth remaining and is in general implemented to hold the curve and prevent it from progressing to the point where surgery is recommended in some cases with juveniles bracing has reduced curves significantly going from a 40 degrees of the curve mentioned in length above out of the brace to 18 degrees in it braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis bracing involves fitting the patient with a device that covers the torso in some cases it extends to the neck the most commonly used brace is a tlso such as a boston brace a corsetlike appliance that fits from armpits to hips and is custommade from fiberglass or plastic it is sometimes worn 2223 hours a day depending on the doctors prescription and applies pressure on the curves in the spine the effectiveness of the brace depends not only on brace design and orthotist skill but on patient compliance and amount of wear per day the typical use of braces is for idiopathic curves that are not grave enough to warrant surgery but they may also be used to prevent the progression of more severe curves in young children to buy the child time to grow before performing surgery which would prevent further growth in the part of the spine affected indications for scoliosis bracing scoliosis professionals determine the proper bracing method for a patient after a complete clinical evaluation the patients growth potential age maturity and scoliosis cobb angle rotation and sagittal profile are also considered immature patients who present with cobb angles less than 20 degrees should be closely monitored immature patients who present with cobb angles of 20 degrees to 29 degrees should be braced according to the risk of progression by considering age cobb angle increase over a sixmonth period risser sign and clinical presentation immature patients who present with cobb angles greater than 30 degrees should be braced however these are guidelines and not every patient will fit into this table for example an immature patient with a 17degree cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flatback could be considered for nighttime bracing on the opposite end of the growth spectrum a 29degree cobb angle and a risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because there is reduced potential for progression  surgery is indicated by the society on scoliosis orthopaedic and rehabilitation treatment sosort at 45 degrees to 50 degrees  and by the scoliosis research society srs at a cobb angle of 45 degrees  sosort uses the 45degree to 50degree threshold as a result of the welldocumented plus or minus five degrees measurement error that can occur while measuring cobb angles scoliosis braces are usually comfortable for the patient especially when it is well designed and fit also after the 7 to 10day break in period a well fit and functioning scoliosis brace provides comfort when it is supporting the deformity and redirecting the body into a more corrected and normal physiological position  the scoliosis research societys recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25 curves presenting between 30 and 45 risser sign 0 1 or 2 an xray measurement of a pelvic growth area and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls  progressive scolioses exceeding 25 cobb angle in the pubertal growth spurt should be treated with a patternspecific brace like the chêneau brace and its derivatives with an average bracewearing time of 16 hoursday 23 hoursday assures the best possible result the latest standard of brace construction is with cadcam technology with the help of this technology it has been possible to standardize the patternspecific brace treatment severe mistakes in brace construction are largely ruled out with the help of these systems this technology also eliminates the need to make a plaster cast for brace construction the measurements can be taken in any place and are simple and not comparable to plastering in germany available cadcam braces are known such as the regnierchêneau brace the rigosystemchêneaubrace rsc brace and the gensingen brace  many patients prefer the chêneau light brace it has the best inbrace corrections reported in international literature and is easier to wear than other braces in use today   however this brace is not available for all curve patterns prior to 2013 the efficacy of bracing has not been definitively demonstrated in randomised clinical studies with more limited studies giving inconsistent conclusions  in 2013 the bracing in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis trial braist published results establishing benefits of bracing in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis in the randomized cohort 72 in the group instructed to wear a brace for 18 hours per day against 48 in the observation group sustained curve progression to under 50 degrees the proxy used for not requiring surgery additionally results suggested that the more a patient wore the brace the better the result   in progressive infantile and sometimes juvenile scoliosis a plaster jacket applied early may be used instead of a brace it has been proven possible  to permanently correct cases of infantile idiopathic scoliosis by applying a series of plaster casts edf elongation derotation flexion on a specialized frame under corrective traction which helps to mould the infants soft bones and work with their growth spurts this method was pioneered by uk scoliosis specialist min mehta  edf casting is now the only clinically known nonsurgical method of complete correction in progressive infantile scoliosis complete correction may be obtained for curves less than 50 if the treatment begins before the second year of life   surgery is usually recommended by orthopedists for curves with a high likelihood of progression ie greater than 45 to 50 of magnitude curves that would be cosmetically unacceptable as an adult curves in patients with spina bifida and cerebral palsy that interfere with sitting and care and curves that affect physiological functions such as breathing  surgery for scoliosis is performed by a surgeon specializing in spine surgery for various reasons  it is usually impossible to completely straighten a scoliotic spine but in most cases significant corrections are achieved  the two main types of surgery are one or both of these surgical procedures may be needed the surgery may be done in one or two stages and on average takes four to eight hours spinal fusion is the most widely performed surgery for scoliosis in this procedure bone either harvested from elsewhere in the body autograft or from a donor allograft is grafted to the vertebrae so when they heal they form one solid bone mass and the vertebral column becomes rigid this prevents worsening of the curve at the expense of some spinal movement this can be performed from the anterior front aspect of the spine by entering the thoracic or abdominal cavities or more commonly performed from the back posterior a combination may be used in more severe cases though the modern pedicle screw system has largely negated the need for this  in recent years allscrew systems have become the goldstandard technique for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis pedicle screws achieve better fixation of the vertebral column and have better biomechanical properties than previous techniques so enabling greater correction of the curve in all planes  pedicle screwonly posterior spinal fusion may improve major curve correction at two years among patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ais  as compared to hybrid instrumentation proximal hooks with distal pedicle screws 65 versus 46 according to a retrospective matchedcohort study  the prospective cohorts were matched to the retrospective cohorts according to patient age fusion levels lenke curve type and operative method the two groups were not significantly different in regard to age lenke ais curve type or riser grade the numbers of fused vertebrae were significantly different 11716 for pedicle screw versus 13012 for hybrid group this studys results may be biased due to the pedicle screw groups being analyzed prospectively versus retrospective analysis of the hybrid instrumentation group in general modern spinal fusions have good outcomes with high degrees of correction and low rates of failure and infection however a systematic review of pubmed papers in 2008 concluded scoliosis surgery has a varying but high rate of complications although the nonstandardised data on complications was difficult to assess and was incomplete  patients with fused spines and permanent implants tend to have normal lives with unrestricted activities when they are younger it remains to be seen whether those that have been treated with the newer surgical techniques develop problems as they age  a complementary surgical procedure a surgeon may recommend is called thoracoplasty also called costoplasty this is a procedure to reduce the rib hump that affects most scoliosis patients with a thoracic curve a rib hump is evidence of some rotational deformity to the spine thoracoplasty may also be performed to obtain bone grafts from the ribs instead of the pelvis regardless of whether a rib hump is present thoracoplasty can be performed as part of a spinal fusion or as a separate surgery entirely thoracoplasty is the removal or resection of typically four to six segments of adjacent ribs that protrude each segment is one to two inches long the surgeon decides which ribs to resect based on either their prominence or their likelihood to be realigned by correction of the curvature alone the ribs grow back straight thoracoplasty has risks such as increased pain in the rib area during recovery or reduced pulmonary function 1015 is typical following surgery this impairment can last anywhere from a few months to two years because thoracoplasty may lengthen the duration of surgery patients may also lose more blood or develop complications from the prolonged anesthesia a more significant though far less common risk is the surgeon might inadvertently puncture the pleura a protective coating over the lungs this could cause blood or air to drain into the chest cavity hemothorax or pneumothorax respectively  new implants that aim to delay spinal fusion and to allow more spinal growth in young children have been developed for the youngest patients whose thoracic insufficiency compromises their ability to breathe and applies significant cardiac pressure ribcage implants that push the ribs apart on the concave side of the curve may be especially useful these vertical expandable prosthetic titanium ribs veptr provide the benefit of expanding the thoracic cavity and straightening the spine in all three dimensions while allowing it to grow  an expandable rod called a growing rod may be surgically implanted across the segment of spinal curvature and lengthened under surgery every six months to mimic and maintain normal spine growth  this intervention can halt the progress of curvature and gradually straighten the spine a magnetically controlled growing rod mcgr system has been developed and is undergoing clinical trials in hong kong this intervention employs a rod that may be expanded by applying strong magnets to the outside of the patients body and so does not involve repeated surgeries the recently published report on the first two children to reach 24 month followup aged 5 and 12 years is encouraging monthly rod lengthening produced a progressive increase in spinal length and correction of scoliosis was maintained   although these methods are novel and promising they are suitable only for growing patients with earlyonset scoliosis and have a high complication rate  spinal fusion remains the gold standard of surgical treatment for scoliosis  the risk of undergoing surgery for scoliosis was estimated in 2008 to be varying but with a high rate of complications possible complications may be inflammation of the soft tissue or deep inflammatory processes breathing impairments bleeding and nerve injuries it is not yet clear what to expect from spine surgery in the long term   taking into account that signs and symptoms of spinal deformity cannot be changed by surgical intervention surgery remains primarily a cosmetic indication  only especially in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis the most common form of scoliosis never exceeding 80   however the cosmetic effects of surgery are not necessarily stable  for spinal fusion surgery on ais cases with instrumentation attached using pedicle screws complication rates were reported in 2011 as transient neurological injuries between 0 to 15 a pedicle fracture rate of 024 screw malposition assessed by radiography at 15 6 when assessed by ct scans though these patients were asymptomatic not requiring screw revision and screw loosening noted in 076 of patients  in 1962 paul harrington introduced a metal spinal system of instrumentation that assisted with straightening the spine as well as holding it rigid while fusion took place the original now obsolete harrington rod operated on a ratchet system attached by hooks to the spine at the top and bottom of the curvature that when cranked would distract or straighten the curve the harrington rod represented a major advance in the field as it obviated the need for prolonged casting allowing patients greater mobility in the postoperative period and significantly reducing the quality of life burden of fusion surgery additionally as the first system to apply instrumentation directly to the spine the harrington rod was the precursor to most modern spinal instrumentation systems a major shortcoming of the harrington method was it failed to produce a posture wherein the skull would be in proper alignment with the pelvis and it did not address rotational deformity as a result unfused parts of the spine would try to compensate for this in the effort to stand up straight as the person aged there would be increased wear and tear earlyonset arthritis disc degeneration muscular stiffness and pain with eventual reliance on painkillers further surgery inability to work fulltime and disability flatback became the medical name for a related complication especially for those who had lumbar scoliosis  in the 1960s the gold standard for idiopathic scoliosis was a posterior approach using a single harrington rod postoperative recovery involved bed rest casts and braces poor results became apparent over time  in the 1970s an improved technique was developed using of two rods and wires attached at each level of the spine this segmented instrumentation system allowed patients to become mobile soon after surgery  in the 1980s cotreldubousset instrumentation improved fixation and addressed sagittal imbalance and rotational defects unresolved by the harrington rod system this technique used multiple hooks with rods to give stronger fixation in three dimensions usually eliminating the need for postoperative bracing  pain medication in the event of surgery to correct scoliosis pain medications and anesthesia will be administered before the surgery the patient will receive anesthesia with adults the anesthesia will be administered through an iv in the antecubital region of the arm with young children however the child will be asked to breathe in nitrous oxide or laughing gas because needles can be frightening for a young child the nitrous oxide will put them to sleep so the anesthesiologist can then insert the iv in order to give them the anesthesia after the surgery the patient will most likely be given morphine until the patient is ready to take the medicine by mouth an iv will be giving them their medication morphine is the most common pain medicine used after scoliosis surgery and is often administered through a patientcontrolled analgesia pca system the pca system allows the patient to push a button when they are feeling pain and the pca will emit the drugs into the iv and then into the body to prevent overdoses there is a limit on the number of times a patient can push the button if a patient pushes the button too much at once the pca will reject the request  bowel and bladder function for the patients bladder control a catheter will be inserted so that a patient can urinate without having to move a catheter is inserted because the patient will not have much free movement to be able to get up and walk to the bathroom the most common type of catheter used after major surgeries is an indwelling foley catheter the indwelling foley catheter is most often put in the urethra with a tube leading into a drainage bag once the catheter is inserted into the urethra a balloon is blown up inside the bladder in order to keep it from falling out the balloon allows the catheter to remain inside the urethra until the patient is able to get up and go to the bathroom on their own  the drainage bag is connected to the side of the bed and must be changed or emptied out once it is full bowel control can vary from patient to patient the combination of no food very little fluids and a lot of prescription drugs has the potential to cause many patients to become constipated the body is used to a normal diet and used to excreting waste in a system interrupting the system can cause bowel problems this constipation can be resolved in a couple of ways the first way and the most common way is to administer a rectal suppository a rectal suppository is administered through the anus and into the rectum they are bulletshaped and contain medicine that will help the patients bowels get back on track once the suppository is inserted it is designed to melt off the waxlike case and put the medicine in the body  if the suppository does not work a laxative may be continued at home to keep the bowels in full function diet when first returning home after surgery a nutritional diet is necessary in order to keep the body operating correctly junk food is not a good idea as the grease and sugar can irregulate the bowels fruit vegetables and juices will be a vital part in the diet  food and drink will be limited for the patient after surgery because the bowels are not fully active because of anesthetic clear water and ice may be the only acceptable thing to ingest after the digestive tract is back up to speed soft food and drink like pudding soup broth and orange juice are acceptable  very dark urine with a strong odor means that the person is most likely dehydrated and needs more fluids in order for the urine to become a pale or clear color the patient will need to drink a lot of water juices such as prune juice are a healthy option and prune juice also helps with constipation a common factor after surgery when it comes to food whole grains should be added into the diet whole grains can be broken down easily by the body whereas processed grains and flour cannot be broken down easily processed grains and flour also add to constipation  a 50year followup study published in the journal of the american medical association 2003 asserted the lifelong physical health including cardiopulmonary and neurological functions and mental health of idiopathic scoliosis patients are comparable to those of the general population scoliosis that interferes with normal systemic functions is exceptional  and rare and untreated scoliosis patients had similar death rates and were just as functional and likely to lead productive lives 50 years after diagnosis as people with normal spines   in an earlier university of iowa followup study 91 percent of idiopathic scoliosis patients displayed normal pulmonary function and their life expectancy was 2 longer than that of the general population  generally the prognosis of scoliosis depends on the likelihood of progression the general rules of progression are larger curves carry a higher risk of progression than smaller curves and thoracic and double primary curves carry a higher risk of progression than single lumbar or thoracolumbar curves in addition patients not having yet reached skeletal maturity have a higher likelihood of progression ie if the patient has not yet completed the adolescent growth spurt  scoliosis affects 23 of the united states population which is equivalent to about 5 to 9 million cases  a scoliosis spinal columns curve of 10 or less affects 15 to 3 of individuals  the age of onset is usually between 10 years and 15 years can occur at a younger age children and adolescents making up to 85 of those diagnosed this is seen to be due to rapid growth spurts occurring at puberty when spinal development is most relenting to genetic and environmental influences  because female adolescents undergo growth spurts before postural musculoskeletal maturity scoliosis is more prevalent among females  although fewer cases are present today using cobb angle analysis for diagnosis scoliosis remains a prevailing condition appearing in otherwise healthy children incidence of idiopathic scoliosis is stops after puberty when skeletal maturity is reached however further curvature may proceed during late adulthood due to vertebral osteoporosis and weakened musculature  the cost of diagnosis involves both monetary losses and lifestyle limitations that increase with severity respiratory deficiencies may also arise from thoracic deformities and cause abnormal breathing  this directly affects exercise and work capacity decreasing the overall quality of life  in the united states for cases involving surgical procedures an average cost was 30000 to 60000 per patient in 2010  since scoliosis is diagnosed during rapid growth periods costs of bracing reaches up to 5000 as braces must be consistently replaced across multiple routine followups  the scoliosis research society srs is a professional organization of physicians and allied health personnel their primary focus is on providing continuing medical education for healthcare professionals and on fundingsupporting research in spinal deformities founded in 1966 the srs has gained recognition as one of the worlds premier spine societies strict membership criteria ensure the individual fellows support that commitment current membership includes over 1000 of the worlds leading spine surgeons as well as some researchers physician assistants and orthotists who are involved in research and treatment of spinal deformities the purpose of the society is to foster the optimal care of all patients with spinal deformities  idiopathic spontaneously appearing scoliosis represents a majority of cases but its causes are largely unknown results of recent studies indicate potential heritability of the disorder about 38 of variance in scoliosis risk is due to genetic factors and 62 is due to the environment  the genetics are likely very complex however given that we observe inconsistent inheritance and discordance among monozygotic twins  the specific genes that contribute to development of scoliosis have not been conclusively identified several candidate gene studies have found associations between idiopathic scoliosis and genes mediating bone formation bone metabolism and connective tissue structure  more studies of larger samples however are needed to confirm these results additionally several genomewide studies have identified a number of loci as significantly linked to idiopathic scoliosis  scoliosis has not been found in chimpanzees or gorillas  thus it has been hypothesized that scoliosis may actually be related to humans morphological differences from these apes  apes have a shorter and less mobile lower spine than humans some of the lumbar vertebrae in pan are captured between the ilia meaning that they are held fast between the bones of the pelvis additionally old world monkeys have a far larger erector spinae which is the muscle that holds the spine steady than humans  all of these factors make the lumbar spines of most primates less flexible and thus far less likely to deviate than those of humans while this may only explicitly relate to lumbar appearances of scoliosis it is possible that small imbalances in the lumbar spine could precipitate thoracic problems as well  scoliosis may also be a byproduct of strong selection for bipedalism there are significant benefits of a highly mobile elongated lower spine specifically for a bipedal stance  for instance the human spine takes on an sshaped curve with lumbar lordosis which allows for better balance and support of an upright trunk  this and some of the characteristics described above facilitate bipedality but may make the spine more susceptible to scoliotic curvature selection for bipedality was however likely strong enough to justify the maintenance of such a disorder bipedality is hypothesized to have emerged for a variety of different reasons many of which would have certainly conferred fitness advantages it may increase viewing distance which can be beneficial in hunting and foraging as well as protection from predators or other humans it makes long distance travel more efficient for foraging or hunting and it facilitates terrestrial feeding from grasses trees and bushes  given the many benefits of bipedality and its dependence on a particular spinal morphology it is likely that selection for bipedalism played a large role in the development of the spine as we see it today in spite of any resulting potential for scoliotic deviations  moreover according to the fossil record earlier hominins such as australopithecus and h erectus may have exhibited an even greater prevalence of scoliosis as bipedality was first emerging  analysis of their fossils indicates that there may have been selection over time for a slight reduction in lumbar length to what we see today suggesting that selection has favored a spine that can efficiently support bipedality with a lower risk of disorder the links between human spinal morphology bipedality and scoliosis harken to a potential evolutionary basis for the condition

V 1q211 deletion syndrome or 1q211 recurrent microdeletion is a rare aberration of chromosome 1 a human cell has one pair of identical chromosomes on chromosome 1 with the 1q211 deletion syndrome one chromosome of the pair is not complete because a part of the sequence of the chromosome is missing one chromosome has the normal length and the other is too short in 1q211 the 1 stands for chromosome 1 the q stands for the long arm of the chromosome and 211 stands for the part of the long arm in which the deletion is situated the syndrome is a form of the 1q211 copy number variations and it is a deletion in the distal area of the 1q211 part the cnv leads to a very variable phenotype and the manifestations in individuals are quite variable some people who have the syndrome can function in a normal way while others have symptoms of mental retardation and various physical anomalies 1q211 microdeletion is a very rare chromosomal condition only 46 individuals with this deletion have been reported in medical literature as of august 2011    meiosis is the process of dividing cells in humans in meiosis the chromosome pairs split and a representative of each pair goes to one daughter cell in this way the number of chromosomes will be halved in each cell while all the parts on the chromosome genes remain after being randomized which information of the parent cell ends up in the daughter cell is purely decided by chance besides this random process there is a second random process in this second random process the dna will be scrambled in a way that pieces are omitted deletion added duplication moved from one place to another translocation and inverted inversion this is a common process which leads to about 04 variation in the dna a problem of the second random process is that genetic mistakes can occur because of the deletion and duplication process the chromosomes that come together in a new cell may be shorter or longer the result of this spontaneous change in the structure of dna is a socalled copy number variation due to the copy number variation chromosomes of different sizes can be combined in a new cell if this occurs around conception the result will be a first cell of a human with a genetic variation this can be either positive or negative in positive cases this new human will be capable of a special skill that is assessed positively for example in sports or science in negative cases you have to deal with a syndrome or a severe disability as in this case the 1q211 deletion syndrome based on the meiotic process the syndrome may occur in two ways due to this genetic misprint the embryo may experience problems in the development during the first months of pregnancy approximately 20 to 40 days after fertilization something goes wrong in the construction of the body parts and brain which leads to a chain reaction  the structure of 1q211 is complex the area has a size of approximately 6 megabase mb from 1415 mb to 1479 mb within 1q211 there are two areas where the cnvs can be found the proximal area or tar area 1441 to 1445 and the distal area 1447 to 1459 the 1q211 deletion syndrome will commonly be found in the distal area but an overlap with the tararea is possible 1q211 has multiple repetitions of the same structure areas with the same color in the picture have equal structures only 25 of the structure is not duplicated there are several gaps in the sequence there is no further information available about the dnasequence in those areas up till now the gaps represent approximately 700 kilobase new genes are expected in the gaps because the gaps are still a topic of research it is hard to find the exact start and end markers of a deletion the area of 1q211 is one of the most difficult parts of the human genome to map because of the repetitions in 1q211 there is a larger chance of an unequal crossingover during meiosis cnvs occur due to nonallelic homologous recombination mediated by low copy repeats sequentially similar regions a common deletion is restricted to the distal area this is a class ideletion in some cases the deletion is so large that the proximal area is involved as well the socalled class iideletion there are some complex cases in which both the proximal area and the distal area are affected while the area in between is normal there are also some atypical variants recognised symptoms are it is not clear whether the list of symptoms is complete very little information is known about the syndrome the syndrome can have completely different effects on members of the same family a common deletion is between 1019mb mefford states that the standard for a deletion is 135mb  the largest deletion seen on a living human is over 5 mb genes related to 1q211 deletion in the distal area are pde4dip hydin2 prkab2 pdia3p fmo5 chd1l bcl9 acp6 gja5 gja8 nbpf10 gpr89b gpr89c pdzk1p1 and nbpf11 a de novosituation appears in about 75 of the cases in 25 of the cases one of the parents is carrier of the syndrome without any effect on the parent sometimes adults have mild problems with the syndrome to find out whether either of the parents carries the syndrome both parents have to be tested in several cases the syndrome was identified with the child because of an autism disorder or another problem and later it appeared that the parent was affected as well in families where both parents have tested negative for the syndrome chances of a second child with the syndrome are extremely low if the syndrome was found in the family chances of a second child with the syndrome are 50 because the syndrome is autosomal dominant the effect of the syndrome on the child cannot be predicted as of october 2012 unique an international rare chromosome disorder group and registry has 64 geneticallyconfirmed cases of this deletion worldwide  the syndrome can be detected with fluorescence in situ hybridization for parents with a child with the syndrome it is advisable to consult a physician before another pregnancy treatment of cause due to the genetic cause no treatment of the cause is possible treatment of manifestations routine treatment of ophthalmologic cardiac and neurologic findings speech occupational and physical therapies as appropriate specialized learning programs to meet individual needs antiepileptic drugs or antipsychotic medications as needed surveillance routine pediatric care routine developmental assessments monitoring of specific identified medical issues on several locations in the world people are studying on the subject of 1q211 deletion syndrome the syndrome was identified for the first time with people with heart abnormalities the syndrome has later been found with patients with autism and schizophrenia research is done on patients with a symptom of the syndrome to find more patients with the syndrome there may be a relation between autism and schizophrenia literature shows that nine locations have been found on the dna where the syndromes related to autism or schizophrenia can be found the socalled hotspots 1q211 3q29 15q133 16p112 16p131 16q21 17p12 21q112 and 21q133 with a number of hotspots both autism and schizophrenia were observed at that location in other cases either autism or schizophrenia has been seen statistical research showed that schizophrenia is more common in combination with 1q211 deletion syndrome on the other side autism is significantly more common with 1q211 duplication syndrome further research confirmed that the odds on a relation between schizophrenia and deletions at 1q211 3q29 15q133 22q1121 en neurexin 1 nrxn1 and duplications at 16p112 are at 75 or higher   common variations in the bcl9 gene which is in the distal area confer risk of schizophrenia and may also be associated with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder  research is done on 1012 genes on 1q211 that produce duf1220locations duf1220 is an unknown protein which is active in the neurons of the brain near the neocortex based on research on apes and other mammals it is assumed that duf1220 is related to cognitive development man 212 locations chimpanzee 37 locations monkey 30 locations mouse 1 location it appears that the duf1220locations on 1q211 are in areas that are related to the size and the development of the brain the aspect of the size and development of the brain is related to autism macrocephaly and schizophrenia microcephaly it has been proposed that a deletion or duplication of a gene that produces duf1220areas might cause growth and development disorders in the brain   another relation between macrocephaly with duplications and microcephaly with deletions has been seen in research on the hydin paralog or hydin2 this part of 1q211 is involved in the development of the brain it is assumed to be a dosagesensitive gene when this gene is not available in the 1q211 area it leads to microcephaly hydin2 is a recent duplication found only in humans of the hydin gene found on 16q222  research on the genes chd1l and prkab2 within lymphoblast cells   lead to the conclusion that anomalies appear with the 1q211deletionsyndrome gja5 has been identified as the gene that is responsible for the phenotypes observed with congenital heart diseases on the 1q211 location in case of a duplication of gja5 tetralogy of fallot is more common in case of a deletion other congenital heart diseases than tetralogy of fallot are more common

V rubella also known as german measles or threeday measles  is an infection caused by the rubella virus  this disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are sick   a rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days it usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body the rash is not as bright as that of measles and is sometimes itchy swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks  a fever sore throat and fatigue may also occur   in adults joint pain is common complications may include bleeding problems testicular swelling and inflammation of nerves  infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome crs or miscarriage symptoms of crs include problems with the eyes such as cataracts ears such as deafness heart and brain problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy  rubella is usually spread through the air via coughs of people who are infected   people are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash babies with crs may spread the virus for more than a year  only humans are infected  insects do not spread the disease  once recovered people are immune to future infections testing is available that can verify immunity  diagnosis is confirmed by finding the virus in the blood throat or urine testing the blood for antibodies may also be useful  rubella is preventable with the rubella vaccine with a single dose being more than 95 effective  often it is given in combination with the measles vaccine and mumps vaccine known as the mmr vaccine  with a population vaccination rate of less than 80 however more women might make it to childbearing age without developing immunity and issues could increase  once infected there is no specific treatment  rubella is a common infection in many areas of the world  each year about 100000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome occur  rates of disease have decreased in many areas including the americas as a result of vaccination   there are ongoing efforts to eliminate the disease globally  the name rubella is from latin and means little red it was first described as a separate disease by german physicians in 1814 resulting in the name german measles  on april 29 2015 the world health organization declared the americas officially free of rubella transmission     rubella has symptoms that are similar to those of flu however the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash exanthem on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days that is why it is often referred to as threeday measles the facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body other symptoms include low grade fever swollen glands sub occipital  posterior cervical lymphadenopathy joint pains headache and conjunctivitis  the swollen glands or lymph nodes can persist for up to a week and the fever rarely rises above 38  c 1004  f the rash of german measles is typically pink or light red the rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days the rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin when the rash clears up the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it forchheimers sign occurs in 20 of cases and is characterized by small red papules on the area of the soft palate  rubella can affect anyone of any age and is generally a mild disease rare in infants or those over the age of 40 the older the person is the more severe the symptoms are likely to be up to 60 of older girls or women experience joint pain or arthritic type symptoms with rubella  in children rubella normally causes symptoms which last two days and include  in older children and adults additional symptoms may be present including  serious problems can occur including the following coryza in rubella may convert to pneumonia either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia and bronchitis either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis  rubella can cause congenital rubella syndrome in the newborn the syndrome crs follows intrauterine infection by the rubella virus and comprises cardiac cerebral ophthalmic and auditory defects  it may also cause prematurity low birth weight and neonatal thrombocytopenia anemia and hepatitis the risk of major defects or organogenesis is highest for infection in the first trimester crs is the main reason a vaccine for rubella was developed  many mothers who contract rubella within the first critical trimester either have a miscarriage or a still born baby if the baby survives the infection it can be born with severe heart disorders patent ductus arteriosus being the most common blindness deafness or other lifethreatening organ disorders the skin manifestations are called blueberry muffin lesions  for these reasons rubella is included on the torch complex of perinatal infections about 100000 cases of this condition occur each year  the disease is caused by rubella virus a togavirus that is enveloped and has a singlestranded rna genome  the virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the nasopharynx and lymph nodes the virus is found in the blood 5 to 7 days after infection and spreads throughout the body the virus has teratogenic properties and is capable of crossing the placenta and infecting the fetus where it stops cells from developing or destroys them  during this incubation period the patient is contagious typically for about one week before heshe develops a rash and for about one week thereafter increased susceptibility to infection might be inherited as there is some indication that hlaa1 or factors surrounding a1 on extended haplotypes are involved in virus infection or nonresolution of the disease    rubella virus specific igm antibodies are present in people recently infected by rubella virus but these antibodies can persist for over a year and a positive test result needs to be interpreted with caution  the presence of these antibodies along with or a short time after the characteristic rash confirms the diagnosis  rubella infections are prevented by active immunisation programs using live disabled virus vaccines two live attenuated virus vaccines ra 273 and cendehill strains were effective in the prevention of adult disease however their use in prepubertile females did not produce a significant fall in the overall incidence rate of crs in the uk reductions were only achieved by immunisation of all children  the vaccine is now usually given as part of the mmr vaccine the who recommends the first dose be given at 12 to 18 months of age with a second dose at 36 months pregnant women are usually tested for immunity to rubella early on women found to be susceptible are not vaccinated until after the baby is born because the vaccine contains live virus  the immunisation program has been quite successful cuba declared the disease eliminated in the 1990s and in 2004 the centers for disease control and prevention announced that both the congenital and acquired forms of rubella had been eliminated from the united states   screening for rubella susceptibility by history of vaccination or by serology is recommended in the united states for all women of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital rubella syndrome crs  it is recommended that all susceptible nonpregnant women of childbearing age should be offered rubella vaccination  due to concerns about possible teratogenicity use of mmr vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy  instead susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the postpartum period  there is no specific treatment for rubella however management is a matter of responding to symptoms to diminish discomfort treatment of newborn babies is focused on management of the complications congenital heart defects  and cataracts can be corrected by direct surgery  management for ocular congenital rubella syndrome crs is similar to that for agerelated macular degeneration including counseling regular monitoring and the provision of low vision devices if required  rubella infection of children and adults is usually mild selflimiting and often asymptomatic the prognosis in children born with crs is poor  rubella is a disease that occurs worldwide the virus tends to peak during the spring in countries with temperate climates before the vaccine to rubella was introduced in 1969 widespread outbreaks usually occurred every 69 years in the united states and 35 years in europe mostly affecting children in the 59 year old age group  since the introduction of vaccine occurrences have become rare in those countries with high uptake rates vaccination has interrupted the transmission of rubella in the americas no endemic case has been observed since february 2009  since the virus can always be reintroduced from other continents the population still need to remain vaccinated to keep the western hemisphere free of rubella during the epidemic in the us between 19621965 rubella virus infections during pregnancy were estimated to have caused 30000 still births and 20000 children to be born impaired or disabled as a result of crs   universal immunisation producing a high level of herd immunity is important in the control of epidemics of rubella  in the uk there remains a large population of men susceptible to rubella who have not been vaccinated outbreaks of rubella occurred amongst many young men in the uk in 1993 and in 1996 the infection was transmitted to pregnant women many of whom were immigrants and were susceptible outbreaks still arise usually in developing countries where the vaccine is not as accessible  in japan 15000 cases of rubella and 43 cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported to the national epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases between october 15 2012 and march 2 2014 during the 201213 rubella outbreak in japan they mainly occurred in men of ages 31 to 51 and young adults aged 2434   rubella was first described in the mideighteenth century friedrich hoffmann made the first clinical description of rubella in 1740  which was confirmed by de bergen in 1752 and orlow in 1758  in 1814 george de maton first suggested that it be considered a disease distinct from both measles and scarlet fever all these physicians were german and the disease was known as rötheln contemporary german röteln hence the common name of german measles  henry veale an english royal artillery surgeon described an outbreak in india he coined the name rubella from the latin word meaning little red in 1866     it was formally recognised as an individual entity in 1881 at the international congress of medicine in london  in 1914 alfred fabian hess theorised that rubella was caused by a virus based on work with monkeys  in 1938 hiro and tosaka confirmed this by passing the disease to children using filtered nasal washings from acute cases  in 1940 there was a widespread epidemic of rubella in australia subsequently ophthalmologist norman mcallister gregg found 78 cases of congenital cataracts in infants and 68 of them were born to mothers who had caught rubella in early pregnancy   gregg published an account congenital cataract following german measles in the mother in 1941 he described a variety of problems now known as congenital rubella syndrome crs and noticed that the earlier the mother was infected the worse the damage was since no vaccine was yet available some popular magazines promoted the idea of german measles parties for infected children to spread the disease to other children especially girls to immunize them for life and protect them from later catching the disease when pregnant  the virus was isolated in tissue culture in 1962 by two separate groups led by physicians parkman and weller   there was a pandemic of rubella between 1962 and 1965 starting in europe and spreading to the united states  in the years 196465 the united states had an estimated 125 million rubella cases this led to 11000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome of these 2100 died as neonates 12000 were deaf 3580 were blind and 1800 were mentally retarded in new york alone crs affected 1 of all births    in 1969 a live attenuated virus vaccine was licensed  in the early 1970s a triple vaccine containing attenuated measles mumps and rubella mmr viruses was introduced  by 2006 confirmed cases in the americas had dropped below 3000 a year however a 2007 outbreak in argentina brazil and chile pushed the cases to 13000 that year  on january 22 2014 the world health organization who and the pan american health organization declared and certified colombia free of the rubella and became the first latin american country to eliminate the disease within its borders   on april 29 2015 the americas became the first who region to officially eradicate the disease the last nonimported cases occurred in 2009 in argentina and brazil panamerican health organization director remarked the fight against rubella has taken more than 15 years but it has paid off with what i believe will be one of the most important panamerican public health achievements of the 21st century  the declaration was made after 165 million health records and genetically confirming that all recent cases were causing by known imported strains of the virus rubella is still common in some regions of the world and susan e reef head of a global immunization effort said there was no chance it would be eradicated worldwide before 2020  the name rubella is sometimes confused with rubeola an alternative name for measles in englishspeaking countries the diseases are unrelated   in some other european languages like spanish rubella and rubeola are synonyms and rubeola is not an alternative name for measles  thus in spanish rubeola refers to rubella and sarampión refers to measles

V thalidomide sold under the brand names immunoprin among others is an immunomodulatory drug and the prototype of the thalidomide class of drugs today thalidomide is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers multiple myeloma and of a complication of leprosy thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in west germany under the tradename contergan the german drug company chemie grünenthal developed and sold the drug primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic thalidomide also claimed to cure anxiety insomnia gastritis and tension  afterwards it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women thalidomide became an overthecounter drug in west germany on october 1 1957 shortly after the drug was sold in west germany between 5000 and 7000 infants were born with phocomelia malformation of the limbs only 40 of these children survived  throughout the world about 10000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia due to thalidomide only 50 of the 10000 survived those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps other effects included deformed eyes and hearts deformed alimentary and urinary tracts blindness and deafness  the negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations and control over drug use and development  thalidomide is used for a number of conditions including erythema nodosum leprosum multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone and various other cancers for some symptoms of hivaids crohns disease sarcoidosis graftversushost disease rheumatoid arthritis and a number of skin conditions that have not responded to usual treatment  the bacterium that causes tuberculosis is related to leprosy thalidomide may be helpful in some cases where standard tb drugs and corticosteroids are not sufficient to resolve severe inflammation in the brain   there is no conclusive evidence that thalidomide or lenalidomide is useful to bring about or maintain remission in crohns disease   thalidomide may cause side effects such as polyneuropathy fatigue skin rash and venous thromboembolism vte or blood clots which could lead to stroke or myocardial infarction   adverse effects by frequency    very common may affect more than 1 in 10 people common may affect up to 1 in 10 people uncommon may affect up to 1 in 100 people rare may affect up to 1 in 1000 people very rare may affect up to 1 in 10000 people  peripheral neuropathy may be irreversible and usually results from chronic usually a matter of months exposure to thalidomide  animal studies have failed to demonstrate any carcinogenicity even when rats and mice were exposed to up to 11 times the therapeutic dose of thalidomide  despite this there have been some concerns that it may cause secondary malignancies in patients with multiple myeloma the fda has issued a statement that it is investigating these concerns  some clinical trials have supported this claim and the major secondary malignancy that thalidomide is associated with is acute myeloid leukaemia  the mhra of the uk and health canada of canada have also issued warnings to healthcare professionals regarding the risk of secondary malignancies due to thalidomide exposure   contraindications include  there are no expected pharmacokinetic interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on pglycoprotein and p450 cytochromes  it may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action  it may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardiainducing effects  the risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy  the risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents including doxorubicin and melphalan concurrently  thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide  eighteen cases of overdoses have been reported to date with doses of up to 144 g without any reported fatalities  no specific antidote for overdoses exists and treatment is purely supportive  the precise mechanism of action for thalidomide is unknown but possible mechanisms include antiangiogenic and oxidative stressinducing effects  it also inhibits tnf\u03b1 il6 il10 and il12 production  modulates the production of ifn\u03b3  and enhances the production of il2 il4 and il5 by immune cells  it increases lymphocyte count costimulates t cells and modulates natural killer cell cytotoxicity  it also inhibits nf\u03bab and cox2 activity  in 1990 a group of researchers in brazil noted that tnf alpha levels went up in leprosy reactional states and observed that tnf levels decreased in some patients on treatment with thalidomide hence potentially explaining the efficacy of thalidomide in treating enl  the mechanism of thalidomides teratogenic action has led to over 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms  angiogenesis is critical during limb development of the foetus thalidomide can directly inhibit angiogenesis induced by bfgf or vegf in vivo  teratogenic analogs inhibit angiogenesis whereas nonteratogenic analogs do not inhibit angiogenesis  in 2009 research by other groups confirmed conclusively that loss of newly formed blood vessels is the primary cause of thalidomide teratogenesis and developing limbs are particularly susceptible because of their relatively immature highly angiogenic vessel network   thalidomide is racemic the individual enantiomers can racemize due to the acidic hydrogen at the chiral centre which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the phthalimide substituent the racemization process can occur in vivo     so that any plan to administer a purified single enantiomer to avoid the teratogenic effects will most likely be in vain    thalidomide binds to and inactivates the protein cereblon which is important in limb formation  and for the proliferative capacity of myeloma cells this was confirmed in studies that reduced the production of cereblon in developing chick and zebrafish embryos using genetic techniques these embryos had defects similar to those treated with thalidomide thalidomide was developed by german pharmaceutical company chemie grünenthal now grünenthal gmbh   after obtaining a twentyyear patent in april 1954 chemie grünenthal started clinical trials and as early as november 1956 marketed thalidomide for the treatment of respiratory infections under the trade name grippex a combination drug that contained thalidomide quinine vitamin c phenacetin and acetylsalicylicacid aspirin researchers at chemie grünenthal also found that thalidomide was a particularly effective antiemetic that had an inhibitory effect on morning sickness  hence on october 1 1957 the company launched thalidomide and began aggressively marketing it under the trade name contergan  it was proclaimed a wonder drug for insomnia coughs colds and headaches during this time period the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the foetus  thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms at the time of the drugs development scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the placental barrier and harm the developing foetus  even though the effect of alcohol on foetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957  there soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born traced back to the use of the drug thalidomide in late 1959 it was noticed that peripheral neuritis developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter  hence while initially considered safe the drug was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies prior to the third trimester in november 1961 thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public  experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10000 children about 5000 of them in west germany the regulatory authorities in east germany did not approve thalidomide   one reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in west germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for teratogenic effects they had been tested on rodents only as was usual at the time  thalidomide became one of the most successful prescription drugs in the history of medicine   in the uk the british pharmaceutical company the distillers company biochemicals ltd a subsidiary of distillers co ltd now part of diageo plc marketed thalidomide under the brand name distaval as a remedy for morning sickness throughout the united kingdom australia and new zealand their advertisement claimed that distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or childoutstandingly safe distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country   around the world more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from chemie grünenthal by the mid 1950s 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under 37 some reports suggest 51 different trade names in the us representatives from chemie grünenthal approached smith kline  french skf now glaxosmithkline gsk with a request to market and distribute the drug in north america a memorandum rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the us food and drug administration fda shows that as part of its inlicensing approach smith kline and french conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the united states involving 875 people including pregnant women in 195657  in 1956 researchers at skf involved in clinical trials noted that even when used in very high doses thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice  and when administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by chemie grünenthal to be sleep inducing the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans  after completion of the trial and based on reasons kept hidden for decades skf declined to commercialize the drug later chemie grünenthal in 1958 reached an agreement with william s merrell company in cincinnati ohio later richardsonmerrell now part of sanofi to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the united states   the us fda refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution however the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes after the american distributor and manufacturer richardsonmerrell had applied for its approval in september 1960  the official in charge of the fda frances oldham kelsey did not rely on information from the company which did not include any test results richardsonmerrell was called on to perform tests and report the results the company refused and demanded approval six times and was refused each time nevertheless a total of 17 children with thalidomideinduced malformations were born in the us  in canada the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to april 1 1961 there were many different forms sold with the most common variant being talimol  two months after talimol went on sale pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects  it was not until march 2 1962 that both drugs were banned from the canadian market by the fdd and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies  in 1964 israeli physician jacob sheskin administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy the patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosumenl a painful skin condition one of the complications of leprosy this was attempted despite the ban on thalidomides use but results were favourable the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening a clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed  thalidomide has been used by brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe enl since 1965 and by 1996 at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in brazil after 1965  since 1994 the production dispensing and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests despite this cases of thalidomide embryopathy continue   with at least 100 cases identified in brazil between 2005 and 2010  58 million thalidomide pills were distributed throughout brazil in this time period largely to poor brazilians in areas with poor access to healthcare and these cases have occurred despite the controls in 1998 the fda approved the drugs use in the treatment of enl  because of thalidomides potential for causing birth defects the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions the fda required that celgene corporation which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name thalomid establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety steps oversight program the conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug  in 2010 the world health organisation who stated that it did not recommend thalidomide due the difficulty of adequately controlling its use and due to the availability of clofazimine  shortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid1960s its anticancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer including some people with multiple myeloma the trials were inconclusive  little further work was done with thalidomide in cancer until the 1990s  judah folkman pioneered studies into the role of angiogenesis the proliferation and growth of blood vessels in the development of cancer and in the early 1970s had shown that solid tumors could not expand without it   in 1993 he surprised the scientific world by hypothesizing the same was true of blood cancers  and the next year he published work showing that a biomarker of angiogenesis was higher in all people with cancer but especially high in people with blood cancers and other evidence emerged as well  meanwhile a member of his lab robert damato was looking for angiogenesis inhibitors and discovered in 1994 that thalidomide inhibited angiogenesis   around that time the wife of a man who was dying of multiple myeloma and whom standard treatments had failed called folkman asking him about his antiangiogenesis ideas  folkman convinced the patients doctor to try thalidomide and that doctor conducted a clinical trial of thalidomide for people with multiple myeloma in which about a third of the subjects responded to the treatment  the results of that trial were published in the new england journal of medicine in 1999   after further work was done by celgene and others in 2006 the usfood and drug administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients   the exploration of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide analogs   celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide such as lenalidomide that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects except for greater myelosuppression  in 2005 celgene received fda approval for lenalidomide revlimid as the first commercially useful derivative revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities another more potent analog pomalidomide is now fda approved  these thalidomide analogs can be used to treat different diseases or used in a regimen to fight two conditions  interest turned to pomalidomide a derivative of thalidomide marketed by celgene it is a very active antiangiogenic agent   and also acts as an immunomodulator pomalidomide was approved in february 2013 by the us food and drug administration fda as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma  it received a similar approval from the european commission in august 2013 and is expected to be marketed in europe under the brand name imnovid    designated orphan drug under the orphan drug act of 1983 in the late 1950s and early 1960s more than 10000 children in 46 countries were born with deformities such as phocomelia as a consequence of thalidomide use  the severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage day 21 would damage the eyes day 22 the ears and face day 24 the arms and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28 thalidomide did not damage the foetus if taken after 42 days gestation  it is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been although estimates range from 10000 to 20000  to 100000  despite the side effects thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in canada until 1962 canada was the last country to end sales of the drug   in the united kingdom the drug was licensed in 1958 and withdrawn in 1961 of the approximately 2000 babies born with defects around half died within a few months and 466 survived to at least 2010  in spain thalidomide was widely available throughout the 1970s perhaps even into the 1980s there were two reasons for this first state controls and safeguarding were poor indeed it was not until 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported thalidomide second grünenthal failed to insist that its sister company in madrid warn spanish doctors and permitted it to not warn them the spanish advocacy group for victims of thalidomide estimates that in 2015 there were 250300 living victims of thalidomide in spain  the australian obstetrician william mcbride and the german paediatrician widukind lenz suspected a link between birth defects and the drug a theory lenz proved in 1961   mcbride was later awarded a number of honors including a medal and prize money by linstitut de la vie in paris  further animal tests were conducted by dr george somers chief pharmacologist of distillers company in britain which showed foetal abnormalities in rabbits  similar results were also published showing these effects in rats    and other species  in east germany the head of the central pharmacy control commission friedrich jung suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid  meanwhile in west germany it took some time before the increase in dysmelia at the end of the 1950s was connected with thalidomide in 1958 karl beck a former pediatric doctor in bayreuth wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children  based on this fdp whip erich mende requested an official statement from the federal government  for statistical reasons the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide  after the nazi regime with its law for the prevention of hereditarily diseased offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes western germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way  the parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia  also the dfg research project installed after the mende request was not helpful the project was led by pathologist franz büchner who ran the project to propagate his teratological theory büchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons  furthermore it took a while to install a surgeon general in germany the federal ministry of health germany was not founded until 1962 some months after thalidomide was banned from the market  in germany approximately 2500 thalidomide babies were born  several countries either restricted the drugs use or never approved it ingeborg eichler a member of the austrian pharmaceutical admission conference enforced thalidomide tradename softenon being sold under the rules of prescription medication and as a result relatively few affected children were born in austria and switzerland  in the united states pharmacologist frances oldham kelsey md withstood pressure from the richardsonmerrell company and refused food and drug administration fda approval to market thalidomide saying further studies were needed  this reduced the impact of thalidomide in united states patients although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the united states at the time millions of tablets had been distributed to physicians during a clinical testing program it was impossible to know how many pregnant women had been given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative  the numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women the birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms possible birth defects include phocomelia dysmelia amelia bone hypoplasticity and other congenital defects affecting the ear heart or internal organs  franks et al looked at how the drug affected newborn babies the severity of their deformities and reviewed the drug in its early years webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused the most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs with the arms being more frequently affected this syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities  in 1968 a large criminal trial began in germany charging several grünenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury after grünenthal settled with the victims in april 1970 the trial ended in december 1970 with no finding of guilt as part of the settlement grünenthal paid 100 million dm into a special foundation the german government added 320 million dm the foundation paid victims a onetime sum of 250025000 dm depending on severity of disability and a monthly stipend of 100450 dm the monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government as the foundation had run out of money grünenthal paid another 50 million euros into the foundation in 2008 on 31 august 2012 grünenthal chief executive harald f stock phd who served as the chief executive officer of grünenthal gmbh from january 2009 to may 28 2013 and was also a member of executive board until may 28 2013 apologized for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects  at a ceremony stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolize those harmed by thalidomide and apologized for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50years at the time of the apology there were 5000 to 6000 sufferers still alive victim advocates called the apology insulting and too little too late and criticized the company for not compensating victims they also criticized the company for their claim that no one could have known the harm the drug caused arguing that there were plenty of red flags at the time  in 1968 after a long campaign by the sunday times a compensation settlement for the uk victims was reached with distillers company now part of diageo which had distributed the drug in the uk   this compensation which is distributed by the thalidomide trust in the uk was substantially increased by diageo in 2005  the uk government gave survivors a grant of 20 million to be distributed through the thalidomide trust in december 2009  melbourne woman lynette rowe who was born without limbs is leading an australian class action lawsuit against the drugs manufacturer grünenthal which fought to have the case heard in germany the victorian supreme court dismissed grünenthals application in 2012 and the case was heard in australia more than a hundred australian thalidomide survivors are involved in the class action according to rowes lawyer  on 17 july 2012 lynette rowe was awarded an outofcourt settlement believed to be in the millions of dollars and paving the way for class action victims to receive further compensation the drug thalidomides birth defects in children affected many peoples lives and from these events came the formation of the group called the thalidomide victims association of canada a group of 120 canadian survivors   their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies the members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the steps program which aimed to prevent teratogenicity  the effects of thalidomide increased fears regarding the safety of pharmaceutical drugs the society of toxicology of canada was formed after the effects of thalidomide were made public focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology  the need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster the society of toxicology of canada is responsible for the conservation environment protection act focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances  thalidomide brought on changes in the way drugs are tested what type of drugs are used during pregnancy and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs for correctly denying the application despite the pressure from richardsonmerrell kelsey eventually received the presidents award for distinguished federal civilian service at a 1962 ceremony with president john f kennedy in september 2010 the fda honored kelsey with the first kelsey award the award given annually to an fda staff member came 50 years after kelsey then a new medical officer at the agency first reviewed the application from the william s merrell company of cincinnati  the disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs such as the kefauver harris amendment  us and directive 6565eec1 eu  in the united states the new regulations strengthened the fda among other ways by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all sideeffects encountered in testing  the fda subsequently initiated the drug efficacy study implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market investigational uses include

V agent orangeor herbicide orange hois one of the herbicides and defoliants used by the us military as part of its herbicidal warfare program operation ranch hand  during the vietnam war from 1961 to 1971  it was a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides 245t and 24d during the late 1940s and 1950s the us and british collaborated on development of herbicides with potential applications in warfare some of those products were brought to market as herbicides the british were the first to employ herbicides and defoliants to destroy the crops bushes and trees of communist insurgents in malaya during the malayan emergency these operations laid the groundwork for the subsequent use of agent orange and other defoliant formulations by the us  in mid1961 president ngo dinh diem of south vietnam asked the united states to conduct aerial herbicide spraying in his country in august of that year the south vietnamese air force initiated herbicide operations with american help but diems request launched a policy debate in the white house and the state and defense departments  however us officials considered using it pointing out that the british had already used herbicides and defoliants during the malayan emergency in the 1950s in november 1961 president john f kennedy authorized the start of operation ranch hand the codename for the us air forces herbicide program in vietnam agent orange was manufactured for the us department of defense primarily by monsanto corporation and dow chemical   it was given its name from the color of the orangestriped barrels in which it was shipped and was by far the most widely used of the socalled rainbow herbicides  the 245t used to produce agent orange was contaminated with 2378tetrachlorodibenzodioxin tcdd an extremely toxic dioxin compound in some areas tcdd concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the us environmental protection agency   in the absence of specific customary or positive international humanitarian law regarding herbicidal warfare a draft convention prepared by a working group set up within the conference of the committee on disarmament ccd was submitted to the un general assembly in 1976 in that same year the first committee of the general assembly decided to send the text of the draft convention to the general assembly which adopted resolution 3172 on december 10 1976 with the text of the convention attached as an annex thereto the convention namely the environmental modification convention was opened for signature and ratification on may 18 1977 and entered into force in october 5 1978 the convention prohibits the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread longlasting or severe effects many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require casebycase consideration   although in the geneva disarmament convention of 1978 article 24 protocol iii to the weaponry convention has the jungle exception which prohibits states from attacking forests or jungles except if such natural elements are used to cover conceal or camouflage combatants or military objectives or are military objectives themselves this voids any protection of any military or civilians from a napalm attack or something like agent orange and is clear that it was designed to cater to situations like us tactics in vietnam this clause has yet to be revised    chemically agent orange is an approximately 11 mixture of two phenoxyl herbicides  24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 24d and 245trichlorophenoxyacetic acid 245t  in isooctyl ester form  numerous studies have examined health effects linked to agent orange its component compounds and its manufacturing byproducts  in 1969 it was revealed to the public that the 245t was contaminated with a dioxin 2378tetrachlorodibenzodioxin tcdd and that the tcdd was causing many of the previously unexplained adverse health effects which were correlated with agent orange exposure  tcdd has been described as perhaps the most toxic molecule ever synthesized by mangalston 1979  cited in  internal memoranda revealed that monsanto a major manufacturer of 245t had informed the us government in 1952 that its 245t was contaminated  in the manufacture of 245t accidental overheating of the reaction mixture easily causes the product to condense into the toxic selfcondensation product tcdd at the time precautions were not taken against this unintended side reaction which also caused the seveso disaster in italy in 1976 in 1979 yale biologist arthur galston who specialized in herbicide research published a review of what was known at the time about the toxicity of tcdd even vanishingly small quantities of dioxin in the diet caused adverse health effects when tested on animals  since then tcdd has been comprehensively studied it has been associated with increased neoplasms in every animal bioassay reported in the scientific literature  the national toxicology program has classified tcdd as known to be a human carcinogen frequently associated with softtissue sarcoma nonhodgkins lymphoma hodgkins lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll   of the two herbicides that make up agent orange 24d and 245t the latter is considered to be less biodegradable  while degradation of 245t with a halflife on a scale of days can be achieved by adding bacteria of a special strain no substantial degradation was observed in the same soil without addition of bacteria  the halflife of dioxins in soil is more than 10 years  and that of tcdd in human fat tissue is about 7 years  a 1969 report authored by k diane courtney and others found 245t could cause birth defects and stillbirths in mice  several studies have shown an increased rate of cancer mortality for workers exposed to 245t in one such study from hamburg germany the risk of cancer mortality increased by 170 after working for 10 years at the 245tproducing section of a hamburg manufacturing plant  three studies have suggested prior exposure to agent orange poses an increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia in the children of vietnam veterans  it has often been claimed         that the contamination with dioxin was discovered only later however prior to operation ranch hand 19621971 healthrisks had become apparent from several accidents in 245tproduction in the us and in europe  the causes had been investigated and results published  in 1957 specifically stating tetrachlordibenzodioxine proved very active additionally boehringer which used the relatively safer lowtemperatureprocess since 1957 in the same year warned the other producers of 245tcp which were using the hightemperatureprocess pointing out the risk and providing suggestions how to avoid them  starting in 1991 congress asked the institute of medicine to review the scientific literature on agent orange and the other herbicides used in vietnam including their active ingredients and the dioxin contaminant the iom found an association between dioxin exposure and diabetes   several herbicides were discovered as part of efforts by the us and the british to develop herbicidal weapons for use during wwii these included 24d 24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 245t coded ln14 and also known as trioxone mcpa 2methyl4chlorophenoxyacetic acid 1414b and 1414a recoded ln8 and ln32 and isopropyl phenylcarbamate 1313 recoded ln33  in 1943 the us department of the army contracted the university of chicago to study the effects of 24d and 245t on cereal grains including rice and broadleaf crops from these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply in early 1945 the us army ran tests of various 24d and 245t mixtures at the bushnell army airfield in florida which is now listed as a formerly used defense site fuds as a result the us began a fullscale production of 24d and 245t and would have used it against japan in 1946 during operation downfall if the war had continued   by the end of the war the relationship between the two countries was well established in the years after the war the us tested 1100 compounds and field trials of the more promising ones were done at british stations in india and australia to establish their effects in tropical conditions as well as at the uss testing ground in florida  between 1950 and 1952 for example trials were conducted in tanganyika at kikore and stunyansa to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions the chemicals involved were 24d 245t and endothall 36endoxohexahydrophthalic acid during 195253 the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 245t over the waturi peninsula in kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of tsetse fly  during the malayan emergency britain was the first nation to employ the use of herbicides and defoliants to destroy bushes trees and vegetation to deprive insurgents of cover and targeting food crops as part of a starvation campaign in the early 1950s a detailed account of how the british experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists ek woodford of agricultural research councils unit of experimental agronomy and hgh kearns of the university of bristol  after the malayan conflict ended in 1960 the us considered the british precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a legal tactic of warfare secretary of state dean rusk advised president john f kennedy that the british had established a precedent for warfare with herbicides in malaya  during the vietnam war between 1962 and 1971 the united states military sprayed nearly 20000000 us gallons 75700000l of chemical herbicides and defoliants in vietnam eastern laos and parts of cambodia as part of the aerial defoliation program known as operation ranch hand reaching its peak from 1967 to 1969    like the british did in malaya the goal was to defoliate ruralforested land depriving guerrillas of food and cover and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters  the program was also a part of a general policy of forced draft urbanization which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside forcing them to flee to the us dominated cities depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base   spraying was usually done either from helicopters or from lowflying c123 provider aircraft fitted with sprayers and mc1 hourglass pump systems and 1000usgal 3800l chemical tanks spray runs were also conducted from trucks boats and backpack sprayers    the first batch of herbicides was unloaded at tan son nhut air base in south vietnam on january 9 1962  us air force records show at least 6542 spraying missions took place over the course of operation ranch hand  by 1971 12 percent of the total area of south vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended us department of agriculture application rate for domestic use  in south vietnam alone an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land was ultimately destroyed  in some areas tcdd concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the us environmental protection agency   the campaign destroyed 5million acres 20000km  of upland and mangrove forests and millions of acres of crops overall more than 20 of south vietnams forests were sprayed at least once over a nineyear period   in 1965 members of the us congress were told crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the program  military personnel were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas they later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas it was in reality only being grown to support the local civilian population for example in quang ngai province 85 of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone this contributed to widespread famine leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving  the us military began targeting food crops in october 1962 primarily using agent blue the american public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring in 1965 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops the first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the state department in march 1966   many experts at the time including arthur galston the biologist who developed and intensively studied 245t and tcdd opposed herbicidal warfare due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area as early as 1966 resolutions were introduced to the united nations charging that the us was violating the 1925 geneva protocol which regulated the use of chemical and biological weapons the us defeated most of the resolutions   arguing that agent orange was not a chemical or a biological weapon as it was considered a herbicide and a defoliant and it was used in effort to destroy plant crops to deprive the enemy of cover and not meant to target human beings a weapon by definition is any device used to injure defeat or destroy living beings structures or systems and agent orange did not qualify under that definition it also argued that if the us were to be charged for using agent orange then britain and its commonwealth nations should be charged since they also used it widely during the malayan emergency in the 1950s  in 1969 during a debate in the first committee of the un general assembly on the question of chemical and bacteriological biological weapons britain stated with respect to the then still draft resolution 2603 xxiv the evidence seems to us to be notably inadequate for the assertion that the use in war of chemical substances specifically toxic to plants is prohibited by international law  stacks of 55gallon 200 l drums containing agent orange defoliant spray run part of operation ranch hand during the vietnam war by uc123b provider aircraft us army armored personnel carrier apc spraying agent orange over vietnamese rice fields during the vietnam war a uh1d helicopter from the 336th aviation company sprays a defoliation agent over farmland in the mekong delta the government of vietnam says that 4 million of its citizens were exposed to agent orange and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it these figures include the children of people who were exposed  the red cross of vietnam estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to contaminated agent orange  the united states government has challenged these figures as being unreliable  according to a study by one vietnamese scientist dr nguyen viet nhan children in the areas where agent orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems including cleft palate mental disabilities hernias and extra fingers and toes  in the 1970s high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of south vietnamese women and in the blood of us military personnel who had served in vietnam  the most affected zones are the mountainous area along truong son long mountains and the border between vietnam and cambodia the affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases  about 28 of the former us military bases in vietnam where the herbicides were stored and loaded onto airplanes may still have high level of dioxins in the soil posing a health threat to the surrounding communities extensive testing for dioxin contamination has been conducted at the former us airbases in da nang phu cat and bien hoa some of the soil and sediment on the bases have extremely high levels of dioxin requiring remediation the da nang airbase has dioxin contamination up to 350 times higher than international recommendations for action   the contaminated soil and sediment continue to affect the citizens of vietnam poisoning their food chain and causing illnesses serious skin diseases and a variety of cancers in the lungs larynx and prostate  about 178 percent3100000 hectares 12000sqmiof the total forested area of vietnam was sprayed during the war which disrupted the ecological equilibrium the persistent nature of dioxins erosion caused by loss of tree cover and loss of seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult or impossible in many areas  many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species such as bamboo and cogon grass making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely animalspecies diversity was also impacted in one study a harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals  dioxins from agent orange have persisted in the vietnamese environment since the war settling in the soil and sediment and entering the food chain through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas the movement of dioxins through the food web has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification  the areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are former us air bases  the rand corporations memorandum 5446isaarpa states the fact that the vc obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops if they the vc are to be hampered by the crop destruction program it will be necessary to destroy large portions of the rural economy  probably 50 or more  ruraltourban migration rates dramatically increased in south vietnam as peasants escaped the war in the countryside by fleeing to the cities the urban population in south vietnam nearly tripled growing from 28 million people in 1958 to 8 million by 1971 the rapid flow of people led to a fastpaced and uncontrolled urbanization an estimated 15 million people were living in saigon slums  studies have shown that veterans have increased rates of cancer and nerve digestive skin and respiratory disorders in particular higher rates of acutechronic leukemia hodgkins lymphoma and nonhodgkins lymphoma throat cancer prostate cancer lung cancer colon cancer ischemic heart disease soft tissue sarcoma and liver cancer with the exception of liver cancer these are the same conditions the us veterans administration has determined may be associated with exposure to agent orangedioxin and are on the list of conditions eligible for compensation and treatment  military personnel who loaded airplanes and helicopters used in ranch hand probably sustained some of the heaviest exposures members of the army chemical corps who stored and mixed herbicides and defoliated the perimeters of military bases and mechanics who worked on the helicopters and planes are also thought to have had some of the heaviest exposures however this same group of individuals has not shown remarkably higher incidences of the associated diseases leading to disagreement within certain circles of just how much effect the defoliants actually have on the health of those exposed others with potentially heavy exposures included members of us army special forces units who defoliated remote campsites and members of us navy river units who cleared base perimeters  military members who served on okinawa also claim to have been exposed to the chemical but there is no verifiable evidence to corroborate these claims  while in vietnam the veterans were told not to worry and were persuaded the chemical was harmless  after returning home vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects might be related to agent orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they were exposed in vietnam veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the department of veterans affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to agent orange or more specifically dioxin but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge by april 1993 the department of veterans affairs had compensated only 486 victims although it had received disability claims from 39419 soldiers who had been exposed to agent orange while serving in vietnam  since at least 1978 several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced agent orange among them dow chemical monsanto and diamond shamrock   hy mayerson of the mayerson law offices pc was an early pioneer in agent orange litigation working with environmental attorney victor yannacone in 1980 on the first classaction suits against wartime manufacturers of agent orange in meeting dr ronald a codario one of the first civilian doctors to see afflicted patients mayerson so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a vietnam veteran forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on agent orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to codarios office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor  the corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the us government  the mayerson law firm with sgt charles e hartz as their principal client filed the first us agent orange classaction lawsuit in pennsylvania in 1980 for the injuries military personnel in vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the defoliant  attorney hy mayerson cowrote the brief that certified the agent orange product liability action as a class action the largest ever filed as of its filing  hartzs deposition was one of the first ever taken in america and the first for an agent orange trial for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial as it was understood that hartz would not live to see the trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of tiger force special forces and lrrps in vietnam   the firm also located and supplied critical research to the veterans lead expert dr ronald a codario md including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction  the chemical companies involved denied that there was a link between agent orange and the veterans medical problems however on may 7 1984 seven chemical companies settled the classaction suit out of court just hours before jury selection was to begin the companies agreed to pay 180 million as compensation if the veterans dropped all claims against them  slightly over 45 of the sum was ordered to be paid by monsanto alone  many veterans who were victims of agent orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers fairness hearings were held in five major american cities where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers federal judge julius weinstein refused the appeals claiming the settlement was fair and just by 1989 the veterans fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out a totally disabled vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of 12000 spread out over the course of 10 years furthermore by accepting the settlement payments disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement such as food stamps public assistance and government pensions a widow of a vietnam veteran who died of agent orange exposure would only receive 3700  in 2004 monsanto spokesman jill montgomery said monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by agent orange saying we are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause but reliable scientific evidence indicates that agent orange is not the cause of serious longterm health effects  in 1980 new jersey created the new jersey agent orange commission the first state commission created to study its effects the commissions research project in association with rutgers university was called the pointman project it was disbanded by governor christine todd whitman in 1996  during pointman i commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood prior to this such levels could only be found in the adipose fat tissue the project studied dioxin tcdd levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of vietnam veterans who had been exposed to agent orange and compared them to those of a matched control group the levels were found to be higher in the former group  the second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of vietnam veterans including army marines and brown water riverboat navy personnel in 1991 congress enacted the agent orange act giving the department of veterans affairs the authority to declare certain conditions presumptive to exposure to agent orangedioxin making these veterans who served in vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions  the same law required the national academy of sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in vietnam to inform the secretary of veterans affairs about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to agent orangedioxin and certain conditions  the authority for the national academy of sciences reviews and addition of any new diseases to the presumptive list by the va is expiring in 2015 under the sunset clause of the agent orange act of 1991  through this process the list of presumptive conditions has grown since 1991 and currently the us department of veterans affairs has listed prostate cancer respiratory cancers multiple myeloma type ii diabetes mellitus hodgkins disease nonhodgkins lymphoma soft tissue sarcoma chloracne porphyria cutanea tarda peripheral neuropathy chronic lymphocytic leukemia and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to agent orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide this list now includes b cell leukemias such as hairy cell leukemia parkinsons disease and ischemic heart disease these last three having been added on august 31 2010 several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should in fact actually have been included  the va denied the applications of veterans because as nonvietnamera veterans or as vietnamera veterans without boots on the ground service in vietnam they were not covered at the request of the va the institute of medicine evaluated whether or not service in these c123 aircrafts could have plausibly exposed soldiers and been detrimental to their health their report postvietnam dioxin exposure in agent orangecontaminated c123 aircraft confirmed it  in 2002 vietnam and the us held a joint conference on human health and environmental impacts of agent orange following the conference the us national institute of environmental health sciences niehs began scientific exchanges between the us and vietnam and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of agent orange  these negotiations broke down in 2005 when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled more progress has been made on the environmental front in 2005 the first usvietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held  starting in 2005 the us environmental protection agency epa began to work with the vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the da nang airbase also in 2005 the joint advisory committee on agent orange made up of representatives of vietnamese and us government agencies was established the committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation technical assistance and environmental remediation of dioxin  a breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of united states president george w bushs state visit to vietnam in november 2006 in the joint statement president bush and president triet agreed further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage sites would make a valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relationship  on may 25 2007 president bush signed the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act 2007 into law for the wars in iraq and afghanistan that included an earmark of 3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin hotspots on former us military bases and for public health programs for the surrounding communities  some authors consider this to be completely inadequate pointing out that the us airbase in da nang alone will cost 14 million to clean up and that three others are estimated to require 60 million for cleanup  the appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in fy 2010 an additional 12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year 2010 in the supplemental appropriations act and a total of 185 million appropriated for fiscal year 2011  secretary of state hillary clinton stated during a visit to hanoi in october 2010 that the us government would begin work on the cleanup of dioxin contamination at the da nang airbase  in june 2011 a ceremony was held at da nang airport to mark the start of usfunded decontamination of dioxin hotspots in vietnam 32 million has so far been allocated by the us congress to fund the program  a 43 million project began in the summer of 2012 as vietnam and the us forge closer ties to boost trade and counter chinas rising influence in the disputed south china sea  on january 31 2004 a victims rights group the vietnam association for victims of agent orangedioxin vava filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york in brooklyn against several us companies for liability in causing personal injury by developing and producing the chemical and claimed that the use of agent orange violated the 1907 hague convention on land warfare 1925 geneva protocol and the 1949 geneva conventions dow chemical and monsanto were the two largest producers of agent orange for the us military and were named in the suit along with the dozens of other companies diamond shamrock uniroyal thompson chemicals hercules etc on march 10 2005 judge jack b weinstein of the eastern district  who had presided over the 1984 us veterans classaction lawsuit  dismissed the lawsuit ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs claims he concluded agent orange was not considered a poison under international law at the time of its use by the us the us was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government  weinstein used the british example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to agent orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it the department of defenses advanced research project agencys arpa project agile was instrumental in the united states development of herbicides as a military weapon an undertaking inspired by the british use of 24d and 245t to destroy junglegrown crops and bushes during the insurgency in malaya the united states considered british precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a legally accepted tactic of war on november 24 1961 secretary of state dean rusk advised president john f kennedy that herbicide use in vietnam would be lawful saying that the use of defoliant does not violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war precedent has been established by the british during the emergency in malaya in their use of helicopters for destroying crops by chemical spraying   george jackson stated that if the americans were guilty of war crimes for using agent orange in vietnam then the british would be also guilty of war crimes as well since they were the first nation to deploy the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare and used them on a large scale throughout the malayan emergency not only was there no outcry by other states in response to britains use but the us viewed it as establishing a precedent for the use of herbicides and defoliants in jungle warfare the us government was also not a party in the lawsuit due to sovereign immunity and the court ruled the chemical companies as contractors of the us government shared the same immunity the case was appealed and heard by the second circuit court of appeals in manhattan on june 18 2007 three judges on the second circuit court of appeals upheld weinsteins ruling to dismiss the case they ruled that though the herbicides contained a dioxin a known poison they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans therefore they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law a further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the court of appeals also confirmed this decision the lawyers for the vietnamese filed a petition to the us supreme court to hear the case on march 2 2009 the supreme court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the court of appeals   in a november 2004 zogby international poll of 987 people 79 of respondents thought the us chemical companies which produced agent orange defoliant should compensate us soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in vietnam also 51 said they supported compensation for vietnamese agent orange victims  to assist those who have been affected by agent orangedioxin the vietnamese have established peace villages which each host between 50 and 100 victims giving them medical and psychological help as of 2006 there were 11 such villages thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims us veterans of the war in vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of agent orange have supported these programs in vietnam an international group of veterans from the us and its allies during the vietnam war working with their former enemy veterans from the vietnam veterans association established the vietnam friendship village  outside of hanoi the center provides medical care rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from vietnam who have been affected by agent orange in 1998 the vietnam red cross established the vietnam agent orange victims fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout vietnam that have been affected in 2003 the vietnam association of victims of agent orange vava was formed in addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies vava provides medical care rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by agent orange  the vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200000 vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides this totaled 408 million in 2008 alone the vietnam red cross has raised more than 22 million to assist the ill or disabled and several us foundations united nations agencies european governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about 23 million for site cleanup reforestation health care and other services to those in need  vuong mo of the vietnam news agency described one of centers  on june 16 2010 members of the usvietnam dialogue group on agent orangedioxin unveiled a comprehensive 10year declaration and plan of action to address the toxic legacy of agent orange and other herbicides in vietnam the plan of action was released as an aspen institute publication and calls upon the us and vietnamese governments to join with other governments foundations businesses and nonprofits in a partnership to clean up dioxin hot spots in vietnam and to expand humanitarian services for people with disabilities there    on september 16 2010 senator patrick leahy dvt acknowledged the work of the dialogue group by releasing a statement on the floor of the united states senate the statement urges the us government to take the plan of actions recommendations into account in developing a multiyear plan of activities to address the agent orangedioxin legacy  in 2008 australian researcher jean williams claimed that cancer rates in the town of innisfail queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of agent orange by the australian military scientists during the vietnam war williams who had won the order of australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on us war veterans based her allegations on australian government reports found in the australian war memorials archives a former soldier ted bosworth backed up the claims saying that he had been involved in the secret testing neither williams or bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims the queensland health department determined that cancer rates in innisfail were no higher than those in other parts of the state  the brazilian government used  herbicides to defoliate a large section of the amazon rainforest so that alcoa could build the tucuruí dam to power mining operations large areas of rainforest were destroyed along with the homes and livelihoods of thousands of rural peasants and indigenous tribes  agent orange was used as a defoliant in eastern cambodia during the vietnam war but its impacts are difficult to assess due to the chaos caused by the khmer rouge regime  new brunswick the us military with the permission of the canadian government  tested herbicides including agent orange in the forests near the canadian forces base gagetown in new brunswick for three days in 1966 and four days in 1967 soldiers working on the base at that time were advised that the chemicals would have no harmful effects on them to the point they would spray each other with the chemical to cool off this inaccuracy led many to later seek compensation for medical bills veteran john chisholm worked on behalf of fellow veterans to help with claims for the compensation package  on september 12 2007 greg thompson minister of veterans affairs announced that the government of canada was offering a onetime ex gratia payment of 20000 as the compensation package for agent orange exposure at cfb gagetown  on july 12 2005 merchant law group llp on behalf of over 1100 canadian veterans and civilians who were living in and around the cfb gagetown filed a lawsuit to pursue class action litigation concerning agent orange and agent purple with the federal court of canada  on august 4 2009 the case was rejected by the court due to lack of evidence the ruling was appealed   in 2007 the canadian government announced that a research and factfinding program initiated in 2005 had found the base was safe   ontario on february 17 2011 the toronto star revealed that the same chemicals used to strip the jungles of vietnam were also employed to clear extensive plots of crown land in northern ontario  the toronto star reported that records from the 1950s 1960s and 1970s show forestry workers often students and junior rangers spent weeks at a time as human markers holding red heliumfilled balloons on fishing lines while lowflying planes sprayed toxic herbicides including an infamous chemical mixture known as agent orange on the brush and the boys below  the same day in response to the toronto star article the ontario provincial government launched a probe into the use of agent orange  on february 18 2011 the next day ontarios ministry of natural resources widened the probe of agent orange spraying to include all areas of the province where government managed forests on crown land  british columbia records show tens of thousands of gallons of the toxic mixture were applied to clear brush near highways and along power lines in the late 1960s and early 1970s  and in some cases the substance was sprayed next to homes in bc the mix of 24d and 245t was called type b weed and brush killer in government invoices sometimes the engineers ordered 245t by itself and dubbed it type c weed and brush killer in total about 26000 gallons of type b weed and brush killer were ordered between 1965 and 1972 about 10000 gallons of type c weed and brush killer were ordered in the same time period the barrels were shipped to all four of the regions of bc as designated by the ministry of highways kamloops nelson prince george and vancouver in 1976 documents from bc hydro show that 245t and 24d were sprayed along hydro lines vernonmonashee and nicolabrenda circuits the documents also say brushkiller was sprayed in pemberton and daisy lake  an analysis of chemicals present in the islands soil together with resolutions passed by guams legislature suggest that agent orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around military bases anderson air force base naval air station agana guam despite the evidence the department of defense continues to deny that agent orange was ever stored or used on guam several guam veterans have collected an enormous amount of evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 245t which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of agent orange used in vietnam  agent orange was used in korea in the late 1960s  republic of korea troops were the only personnel involved in the spraying which occurred along the korean demilitarized zone dmz citing declassified us department of defense documents korean officials fear thousands of its soldiers may have come into contact with the herbicide in the late 1960s and early 1970s according to one top government official as many as 30000 korean veterans are suffering from illness related to their exposure the exact number of gis who may have been exposed is unknown but c david benbow a north carolina attorney who served as a sergeant with co c 3rd battalion 23rd infantry regiment 2nd infantry division along the dmz in 196869 estimates as many as 4000 soldiers at any given time could have been affected   in 1999 about 20000 south koreans filed two separated lawsuits against us companies seeking more than 5 billion in damages after losing a decision in 2002 they filed an appeal  in january 2006 the south korean appeals court ordered dow chemical and monsanto to pay 62 million in compensation to about 6800 people the ruling acknowledged that the defendants failed to ensure safety as the defoliants manufactured by the defendants had higher levels of dioxins than standard and quoting the us national academy of science report declared that there was a causal relationship between agent orange and 11 diseases including cancers of the lung larynx and prostate the judges failed to acknowledge the relationship between the chemical and peripheral neuropathy the disease most widespread among agent orange victims according to the mercury news  the united states local press kphotv in phoenix arizona alleged that the united states army had buried agent orange in camp carroll the us army base located in gyeongsangbukdo korea  it is based on the claim of three us army veterans they claimed approximately 250 drums of agent orange were buried at camp carroll in 1978 the south korean ministry of environment announced that they will request cooperative investigation at camp carroll officially  the usfk issued a statement that confirmed that barrels were buried there but all plus an additional 60 tons of soil were removed in 1996  currently veterans who provide evidence meeting va requirements for service in vietnam and who can medically establish that anytime after this presumptive exposure they developed any medical problems on the list of presumptive diseases may receive compensation from the va certain veterans who served in korea and are able to prove they were assigned to certain specified around the dmz during a specific time frame are afforded similar presumption  the differences in requirements between vietnam and korea service stem from the fact that congress has not made any laws to provide for the same sweeping presumption of exposure similar to the agent orange act of 1991 for korean veterans  parts of laos were sprayed with agent orange during the vietnam war  the use of agent orange has been controversial in new zealand because of the exposure of new zealand troops in vietnam and because of the production of agent orange for vietnam and other users at an ivon watkinsdow chemical plant in paritutu new plymouth there have been continuing claims as yet unproven that the suburb of paritutu has also been polluted see new zealand in the vietnam war  there are cases of new zealand soldiers developing cancers such as bone cancer but none has been scientifically connected to exposure to herbicides herbicide persistence studies of agents orange and white were conducted in the philippines  the philippine herbicide test program was conducted in cooperation with the university of the philippines college of forestry and was described in a 1969 issue of the philippine collegian the us air force operation to remove herbicide orange from vietnam in 1972 was named operation pacer ivy while the operation to destroy the agent orange stored at johnston atoll in 1977 was named operation pacer ho operation pacer ivy inventory collected agent orange in south vietnam and removed it in 1972 aboard the ship mvtranspacific for storage on johnston atoll  the environmental protection agency epa reports that 1800000 gallons of herbicide orange was stored at johnston island in the pacific and 480000 gallons at gulfport mississippi  research and studies were initiated to find a safe method to destroy the materials and it was discovered they could be incinerated safely under special conditions of temperature and dwell time  however these herbicides were expensive and the air force wanted to resell its surplus instead of dumping it at sea  among many methods tested a possibility of salvaging the herbicides by reprocessing and filtering out the 2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin tcdd contaminant with carbonized charcoaled coconut fibers this concept was then tested in 1976 and a pilot plant constructed at gulfport mississippi  from july to september 1977 during operation pacer ho herbicide orange the entire stock of agent orange from both herbicide orange storage sites at gulfport mississippi and johnston atoll was subsequently incinerated in four separate burns in the vicinity of johnson island aboard the dutchowned waste incineration ship mtvulcanus  as of 2004 some records of the storage and disposition of agent orange at johnston atoll have been associated with the historical records of operation red hat  there have been dozens of reports in the press about use andor storage of military formulated herbicides on okinawa that are based upon statements by former us service members that had been stationed on the island photographs government records and unearthed storage barrels the us department of defense dod has denied these allegations with statements by military officials and spokespersons as well as a january 2013 report authored by dr alvin young that was released in april 2013   in particular the 2013 report refuted articles written by journalist jon mitchell as well as a statement from an ecological assessment of johnston atoll a 2003 publication produced by the united states army chemical materials agency that states in 1972 the us air force also brought about 25000 55gallon 208l drums of the chemical herbicide orange ho to johnston island that originated from vietnam and was stored on okinawa  the 2013 report stated the authors of the 2003 report were not dod employees nor were they likely familiar with the issues surrounding herbicide orange or its actual history of transport to the island and detailed the transport phases and routes of agent orange from vietnam to johnston atoll none of which included okinawa  further official confirmation of restricted dioxin containing herbicide storage on okinawa appeared in a 1971 fort detrick report titled historical logistical political and technical aspects of the herbicidedefoliant program which mentioned that the environmental statement should consider herbicide stockpiles elsewhere in pacom pacific command us government restricted materials thailand and okinawa kadena afb  the 2013 dod report says that the environmental statement urged by the 1971 report was published in 1974 as the department of air force final environmental statement and that the latter did not find agent orange was held in either thailand or okinawa   agent orange was tested by the united states in thailand during the war in southeast asia buried drums were uncovered and confirmed to be agent orange in 1999  workers who uncovered the drums fell ill while upgrading the airport near hua hin 100km south of bangkok  vietnamera veterans whose service involved duty on or near the perimeters of military bases in thailand anytime between february 28 1961 and may 7 1975 may have been exposed to herbicides and may qualify for va benefits a claim for direct exposure is possible if the individual can verify that they worked or lived in close proximity to the affected areas of the bases in thailand a declassified department of defense report written in 1973 suggests that there was a significant use of herbicides on the fencedin perimeters of military bases in thailand to remove foliage that provided cover for enemy forces  in 2013 va determined that herbicides used on the thailand base perimeters may have been tactical and procured from vietnam or a strong commercial type resembling tactical herbicides  the university of hawaii has acknowledged extensive testing of agent orange on behalf of the united states department of defense in hawaii along with mixtures of agent orange on kauai island in 196768 and on hawaii island in 1966 testing and storage in other us locations has been documented by the united states department of veterans affairs   in 1971 the c123 aircraft used for spraying agent orange were returned to the united states and assigned various east coast usaf reserve squadrons and then employed in traditional airlift missions between 1972 and 1982 in 1994 testing by the air force identified some former spray aircraft as heavily contaminated with dioxin residue inquiries by aircrew veterans in 2011 brought a decision by the us department of veterans affairs opining that not enough dioxin residue remained to injure these postvietnam war veterans on 26 january 2012 the us center for disease controls agency for toxic substances and disease registry challenged this with their finding that former spray aircraft were indeed contaminated and the aircrews exposed to harmful levels of dioxin in response to veterans concerns the va in february 2014 referred the c123 issue to the institute of medicine for a special study with results released on january 9 2015   in 1978 the us environmental protection agency suspended spraying of agent orange in national forests  a december 2006 department of defense report listed agent orange testing storage and disposal sites at 32 locations throughout the united states as well as in canada thailand puerto rico korea and in the pacific ocean  the veteran administration has also acknowledged that agent orange was used domestically by us forces in test sites throughout the united states eglin air force base in florida was one of the primary testing sites throughout the 1960s  in february 2012 monsanto agreed to settle a case covering dioxin contamination around a plant in nitro west virginia that had made agent orange monsanto agreed to pay up to 9 million for cleanup of affected homes 84 million for medical monitoring of people affected and the communitys legal fees   on the 9th of august 2012 the united states and vietnam began a cooperative cleaning up of the toxic chemical on part of danang international airport marking the first time washington has been involved in cleaning up agent orange in vietnam danang was the primary storage site of the chemical two other cleanup sites the united states and vietnam are looking at is biên hòa in the southern province of \u0111\u1ed3ng nai  a hotspot for dioxin  and phù cát airport in the central province of bình \u0111\u1ecbnh says us ambassador to vietnam david shear according to the vietnamese newspaper nhân dân the us government provided 41 million to the project which will reduce the contamination level in 73000 m³ of soil by late 2016

V pyloric stenosis or pylorostenosis is narrowing stenosis of the opening from the stomach to the first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum due to enlargement hypertrophy of the muscle surrounding this opening the pylorus meaning gate which spasms when the stomach empties this condition causes severe projectile nonbilious vomiting it most often occurs in the first few months of life when it may thus be more specifically labeled as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis  the thickened pylorus is felt classically as an oliveshaped mass in the middle upper part or right upper quadrant of the infants abdomen in pyloric stenosis it is uncertain whether there is a true congenital anatomic narrowing or whether there is merely a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle this condition typically develops in male babies in the first 2 to 6 weeks of life pyloric stenosis also occurs in adults where the cause is usually a narrowed pylorus due to scarring from chronic peptic ulceration this is a different condition from the infantile form   babies with this condition usually present any time in the first weeks to months of life with progressively worsening vomiting the vomiting is often described as nonbile stained non bilious and projectile vomiting because it is more forceful than the usual spittiness gastroesophageal reflux seen at this age some infants present with poor feeding and weight loss but others demonstrate normal weight gain dehydration may occur which causes a baby to cry without having tears and to produce less wet or dirty diapers due to not urinating for hours or for a few days  constant hunger belching and colic are other possible signs that the baby is unable to eat properly pyloric stenosis seems to be multifactorial with some genetic and some environmental components it is four times more likely to occur in males  and is also more common in the first born  rarely infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition  diagnosis is via a careful history and physical examination often supplemented by radiographic imaging studies pyloric stenosis should be suspected in any young infant with severe vomiting on physical exam palpation of the abdomen may reveal a mass in the epigastrium this mass which consists of the enlarged pylorus is referred to as the olive  and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink rarely there are peristaltic waves that may be felt or seen video on nejm due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosedconfirmed with ultrasound if available showing the thickened pylorus muscle wall thickness 3 millimeters mm or greater and pyloric channel length 14mm or greater are considered abnormal in infants younger than 30 days although somewhat less useful an upper gi series xrays taken after the baby drinks a special contrast agent can be diagnostic by showing the narrowed pyloric outlet filled with a thin stream of contrast material a string sign or the railroad track sign for either type of study there are specific measurement criteria used to identify the abnormal results plain xrays of the abdomen sometimes shows a dilated stomach as shown here although ugi endoscopy would demonstrate pyloric obstruction physicians would find it difficult to differentiate accurately between hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and pylorospasm blood tests will reveal low blood levels of potassium and chloride in association with an increased blood ph and high blood bicarbonate level due to loss of stomach acid which contains hydrochloric acid from persistent vomiting there will be exchange of extracellular potassium with intracellular hydrogen ions in an attempt to correct the ph imbalance these findings can be seen with severe vomiting from any cause the gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum as a consequence all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting which can be of a projectile nature while the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown rogers has assembled compelling evidence that neonatal hyperacidity is involved  this physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively has recently been further reviewed  the vomited material does not contain bile because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents containing bile into the stomach persistent vomiting results in loss of stomach acid hydrochloric acid the chloride loss results in a low blood chloride level which impairs the kidneys ability to excrete bicarbonate this is the significant factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis  a secondary hyperaldosteronism develops due to the decreased blood volume the high aldosterone levels causes the kidneys to avidly retain na  to correct the intravascular volume depletion and excrete increased amounts of k  into the urine resulting in a low blood level of potassium the bodys compensatory response to the metabolic alkalosis is hypoventilation resulting in an elevated arterial pco2 infantile pyloric stenosis is typically managed with surgery  very few cases are mild enough to be treated medically the danger of pyloric stenosis comes from the dehydration and electrolyte disturbance rather than the underlying problem itself therefore the baby must be initially stabilized by correcting the dehydration and the abnormally high blood ph seen in combination with low chloride levels with iv fluids this can usually be accomplished in about 2448 hours intravenous and oral atropine may be used to treat pyloric stenosis it has a success rate of 8589 compared to nearly 100 for pyloromyotomy however it requires prolonged hospitalization skilled nursing and careful follow up during treatment  it might be an alternative to surgery in children who have contraindications for anesthesia or surgery or in children whose parents do not want surgery the definitive treatment of pyloric stenosis is with surgical pyloromyotomy known as ramstedts procedure dividing the muscle of the pylorus to open up the gastric outlet this surgery can be done through a single incision usually 34cm long or laparoscopically through several tiny incisions depending on the surgeons experience and preference  today the laparoscopic technique has largely supplanted the traditional open repairs which involved either a tiny circular incision around the navel or the ramstedt procedure compared to the older open techniques the complication rate is equivalent except for a markedly lower risk of wound infection  this is now considered the standard of care at the majority of childrens hospitals across the us although some surgeons still perform the open technique following repair the small 3mm incisions are hard to see the vertical incision pictured and listed above is no longer usually required though many incisions have been horizontal in the past years once the stomach can empty into the duodenum feeding can begin again some vomiting may be expected during the first days after surgery as the gastrointestinal tract settles rarely the myotomy procedure performed is incomplete and projectile vomiting continues requiring repeat surgery pyloric stenosis generally has no long term sideeffects or impact on the childs future males are more commonly affected than females with firstborn males affected about four times as often and there is a genetic predisposition for the disease  it is commonly associated with people of scandinavian ancestry and has multifactorial inheritance patterns  pyloric stenosis is more common in caucasians than hispanics blacks or asians the incidence is 24 per 1000 live births in caucasians 18 in hispanics 07 in blacks and 06 in asians it is also less common amongst children of mixed race parents  caucasian babies with blood type b or o are more likely than other types to be affected  infants exposed to erythromycin are at increased risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life  and possibly in late pregnancy and through breastmilk in the first two weeks of life

V a pelvic digit pelvic finger or pelvic rib is a rare congenital abnormality in humans in which bone tissue develops in the soft tissue near the pelvis resembling a rib or finger and often divided into one or more segments with pseudoarticulations pelvic digits are typically benign and asymptomatic and are usually discovered accidentally approximately 41 cases have been reported  the pelvic digit was first reported by d sullivan and ws cornwell in 1974  pelvic digits may be located at any level of the pelvis the lower ribs or even the anterior abdominal wall it is theorized that pelvic digit anomalies arise during the mesenchymal stage of bone growth within the first six weeks of embryogenesis their formation may result from a failure of the primordium of the coccyx to fuse to the vertebral column leading to the independent development of a protorib structure

V a facial cleft is an opening or gap in the face or a malformation of a part of the face facial clefts is a collective term for all sorts of clefts all structures like bone soft tissue skin etc can be affected facial clefts are extremely rare congenital anomalies there are many variations of a type of clefting and classifications are needed to describe and classify all types of clefting facial clefts hardly ever occur isolated most of the time there is an overlap of adjacent facial clefts  the cause of facial clefts is still unclear it is possible that facial clefts are caused by a disorder in the migration of neural crest cells  another theory is that facial clefts are caused by failure of the fusion process and failure of inwards growth of the mesoderm other theories are that genetics play a part in the development of facial clefts  or that they are caused by amniotic bands  there are different classifications about facial clefts two of the most used classifications are the tessier classification  and the van der meulen classification  tessier is based on the anatomical position of the cleft and van der meulen classification is based on the embryogenesis in 1976 paul tessier published a classification on facial clefts based on the anatomical position of the clefts the different types of tessier clefts are numbered 0 to 14 these 15 different types of clefts can be put into 4 groups based on their position  midline clefts paramedian clefts orbital clefts and lateral clefts the tessier classification describes the clefts at soft tissue level as well as at bone level because it appears that the soft tissue clefts can have a slightly different location on the face than the bony clefts the midline clefts are tessier number 0 and number 14 the clefts comes vertically through the midline of the face tessier number 0 comes through the maxilla and the nose while tessier number 14 comes between the nose and the frontal bone tessier number 1 2 12 and 13 are the paramedian clefts these clefts are quite similar to the midline clefts but they are further away from the midline of the face tessier number 1 and 2 both come through the maxilla and the nose in which tessier number 2 is further from the midline lateral than number 1 tessier number 12 is in extent of number 2 positioned between nose and frontal bone while tessier number 13 is in extent of number 1 also running between nose and forehead both 12 and 13 run between the midline and the orbit tessier number 3 4 5 9 10 and 11 are orbital clefts these clefts all have the involvement of the orbit tessier number 3 4 and 5 are positioned through the maxilla and the orbital floor tessier number 9 10 and 11 are positioned between the upper side of the orbit and the forehead or between the upper side of the orbit and the temple of the head like the other clefts tessier number 11 is in extent to number 3 number 10 is in extent to number 4 and number 9 is in extent to number 5 the lateral clefts are the clefts which are positioned horizontally on the face these are tessier number 6 7 and 8 tessier number 6 runs from the orbit to the cheek bone tessier number 7 is positioned on the line between the corner of the mouth and the ear a possible lateral cleft comes from the corner of the mouth towards the ear which gives the impression that the mouth is bigger its also possible that the cleft begins at the ear and runs towards the mouth tessier number 8 runs from the outer corner of the eye towards the ear the combination of a tessier number 678 is seen in the treacher collins syndrome tessier number 7 is more related to hemifacial microsomia and number 8 is more related to goldenhar syndrome van der meulen classification divides different types of clefts based on where the development arrest occurs in the embryogenesis a primary cleft can occur in an early stage of the development of the face 17mm length of the embryo the developments arrests can be divided in four different location groups internasal nasal nasalmaxillar and maxillar the maxillar location can be subdivided in median and lateral clefts internasal dysplasia nasal dysplasia nasomaxillary dysplasia maxillary dysplasia internasal dysplasia is caused by a development arrest before the union of the both nasal halves these clefts are characterized by a median cleft lip a median notch of the cupids bow or a duplication of the labial frenulum besides the median cleft lip hypertelorism can be seen in these clefts also sometimes there can be an underdevelopment of the premaxilla nasal dysplasia or nasoschisis is caused by a development arrest of the lateral side of the nose resulting in a cleft in one of the nasal halves the nasal septum and cavity can be involved though this is rare nasoschisis is also characterized by hypertelorism nasomaxillary dysplasia is caused by a development arrest at the junction of the lateral side of the nose and the maxilla which results in a complete or noncomplete cleft between the nose and the orbital floor nasoocular cleft or between the mouth nose and the orbital floor oronasalocular cleft the development of the lip is normal maxillary dysplasia can manifest itself on two different locations in the maxilla in the medial or the lateral part of the maxilla there is no single strategy for treatment of facial clefts because of the large amount of variation in these clefts which kind of surgery is used depends on the type of clefting and which structures are involved there is much discussion about the timing of reconstruction of bone and soft tissue the problem with early reconstruction is the recurrence of the deformity due to the intrinsic restricted growth this requires additional operations at a later age to make sure all parts of the face are in proportion  a disadvantage of early bone reconstruction is the chance to damage the tooth germs which are located in the maxilla just under the orbit the soft tissue reconstruction can be done at an early age but only if the used skin flap can be used again during a second operation the timing of the operation depends on the urgency of the underlying condition if the operation is necessary to function properly it should be done at early age the best aesthetic result is achieved when the incisions are positioned in areas which attract the least attention they cover up the scars if however the function of a part of the face isnt damaged the operation depends on psychological factors and the facial area of reconstruction the treatment plan of a facial cleft is planned right after diagnosis this plan includes every operation needed in the first 18 years of the patients life to reconstruct the face fully in this plan a difference is made between problems that need to be solved to improve the health of the patient coloboma and problems that need to be solved for a better cosmetic result hypertelorism the treatment of the facial clefts can be divided in different areas of the face the cranial anomalies the orbital and eye anomalies the nose anomalies the midface anomalies and the mouth anomalies the most common cranial anomaly seen in combination with facial clefts is encephalocele the treatment of encephalocele is based on surgery to repair the bony gap and provide adequate protection of the underlying brain the question remains if the external brain tissue should be put back into the skull or if it is possible to cut off that piece of brain tissue because its claimed that the external piece of brain tissue often isnt functional  with the exception of a basal encephalocele in which the pituitary gland can be found in the mouth the most common orbital eye anomalies seen in children with facial clefts are colobomas and vertical dystopia the coloboma which occurs often in facial clefts is a cleft in the lower or upper eyelid this should be closed as soon as possible to prevent drought of the eye and a consecutive loss of vision  vertical orbital dystopia can occur in facial clefts when the orbital floor andor the maxilla is involved in the cleft vertical orbital dystopia means that the eyes do not lay on the same horizontal line in the face one eye is positioned lower than the other the treatment is based on the reconstruction of this orbital floor by either closing the boney cleft or reconstructing the orbital floor using a bone graft  there are many types of operations which can be performed to treat a hypertelorism 2 options are box osteotomy and facial bipartition  also referred to as a median fasciotomy the goal of the box osteotomy is to bring the orbits closer together by removing a part of the bone between the orbits to detach both orbits from the surrounding bone structures and move both orbits more to the centre of the face the goal of the facial bipartition is not only to bring the orbits closer together but also to create more space in the maxilla this can be done by splitting the maxilla and the frontal bone remove a triangular shaped piece of bone from the forehead and nasal bones and pulling the two pieces of forehead together not only will the hypertelorism be solved by pulling the frontal bone closer together but because of this pulling the space between the both parts of the maxilla will become wider the nose anomalies found in facial clefts vary the main goal of the treatment is to reconstruct the nose to get a functional and esthetic acceptable result a few possible treatment options are to reconstruct the nose with a forehead flap or reconstruct the nasal dorsum with a bone graft for example a rib graft the nasal reconstruction with a forehead flap is based on the repositioning of a skin flap from the forehead to the nose a possible downside of this reconstruction is that once you performed it at a younger age you cant lengthen the flap at a later stage a second operation is often needed if the operation is done on early age because the nose has a restricted growth in the cleft area repair of the ala wing of the nose often requires the inset of cartilage graft commonly taken from the ear  the treatment of soft tissue parts of midface anomalies is often a reconstruction from a skin flap of the cheek this skinflap can be used for other operations in the further as it can be raised again and transposed again in the treatment of midface anomalies there are generally more operations needed bone tissue reconstruction of the midface often occurs later than the soft tissue reconstruction the most common method to reconstruct the midface is by using the fracture incision lines described by rené le fort when the cleft involves the maxilla it is likely that the impaired growth will result in a smaller maxillary bone in all 3 dimensions height projection width there are several options for treatment of mouth anomalies like tessier cleft number 237  these clefts are also seen in various syndromes like treacher collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia which makes the treatment much more complicated in this case treatment of mouth anomalies is a part of the treatment of the syndrome because the cause of facial clefts still is unclear it is difficult to say what may prevent children being born with facial clefts it seems that folic acid contributes to lowering the risk of a child being born with a facial cleft  related articles syndromes

V constriction ring syndrome crs also known or misnamed as adam complex amniotic band sequence amniotic band syndrome amniotic disruption complex amniochorionic mesoblastic fibrous strings congenital amputation constriction band syndrome congenital constriction bands streeter bands tissue bands is a congenital disorder with unknown etiology because of the unknown etiology there are many different and sometimes wrong names see etiology it is a malformation due to intrauterine bands or rings that give deep grooves in most commonly distal extremities like fingers and toes in rare cases the constriction ring can form around other parts of the fetus and cause amputation or even intrauterine death see types and classification the anatomy proximal to the site of constriction or amputation is developmentally normal    crs can be associated with other malformations with club foot being most common    see also types and classification the precise configuration of the bands lymphedema and character of the amputations are not predictable and vary with each individual patient also more than one extremity is usually affected and it is rare for only one ring to present as an isolated malformation with no other manifestation of this syndrome       the diagnosis of constriction ring syndrome can be confirmed with an ultrasonography the clinical manifestations can be extremely variable it could be a single or multiple manifestation this can be confirmed at the end of the first trimester or at the beginning of the second trimester  but not every patient will be diagnosed at that moment most will get this diagnosis at birth differential diagnosisthe differential diagnosis includes adam complex crs is sometimes mislabeled as adam complex adam is an abbreviation for amniotic deformity adhesions mutilations crs is the malformation due to a constriction ring around mostly a limb adamcomplex is the association of limb defects caused by constriction rings and certain craniofacial clefts    adamsoliver syndrome is often mislabeled as crs and consists of cutis aplasia of the scalp in which a longitudinal defect can vary in size and can often be associated with fullthickness skullcap loss the distal digital or toe hypoplasiaaplasia is often confused with crs constriction rings with or without edema are not present the digital or toe hypoplasiaaplasia usually contains diminutive nails or nail folds  there are three different theories to the etiology of the constriction ring syndrome the first is the intrinsic theory which was proposed by streeter in 1930 implicates an anomaly in germ plasm resulting in the defects  this theory is reinforced by the clinical presentation of the constriction rings with other internal visceral and systematic anomalies  because of these other anomalies the names constriction ring syndrome constriction band syndrome and streeter bands are given to this defectdisease the second theory postulates the involvement of an intrauterine disruption during pregnancy followed by a cascade of events involving amniotic rupture when spontaneous rupture of the amnion occurs early in the second trimester the separation of amnion from chorion produces many small thin strands that can become entangled within digits and toes   the names amniotic band syndrome amniotic disruption complex amniochorionic mesoblastic fibrous strings are based on this theory the third theory postulates the involvement of intrauterine trauma intrauterine trauma could be something like amniocentesis or something like an fetal surgery an intrauterine trauma could result in hemorrhage leading to acrosyndactyly one study also showed the presence of bands as confirmed by sonography after fetal surgery   because of these different theories there are many names for this syndrome for a long time people believed the second theory about the amniotic rupture and strands in the research cases not every child had a real amniotic strand it could be that there has to be another explanation for the development of these anomalies the constriction ring syndrome is a complex collection of asymmetric congenital anomalies in which no two cases are exactly alike  this is why a classification is difficult to make the most widely used classification system was proposed by patterson this classification system is based on the severity of the syndrome and is useful because the different types require different treatments other clinicians have amended this scheme by separating the depth of the ring into mild moderate severe and amputation     and by further defining the presence or absence of lymphedema or soft tissue loss distal to the ring  expanding over subdivision in depth of the clefts for every classification is not necessary because the principles of treatment and technique for correction are the same   there are four categories patterson divided the constriction ring associated with acrosyndactyly into three types patterson i there are simple constriction rings which are strands most commonly around the distal extremities as fingers and toes in general the thumb is not likely to be affected by a constriction ring because the fetus typically holds the thumb in tight adduction flexion making entanglement with strands less likely  these malformations need to be surgically removed which must be executed in different stages and can done by different techniques see also treatment patterson ii the crs involves strands which obstruct the lymphatic vessels and thus causing fluid retention distal of the affected extremity this utters itself with swollen parts distal of the constriction patterson iii in this form there is a complex form of syndactyly named acrosyndactyly the fingers or toes were initially separated but due to the constriction they are formed back together sometimes multiple fingers can be involved the distal fusion between digits or toes never initially involves a skeletal coalition  the digits are usually hypoplastic if multiple digits are involved when the constriction cuts of the blood supply to the fingers the fingers can form a peak with the most palmar digit being the index finger normal neurovascular bundles are not present in the distal parts  hands with fused fingers need to be released in phases to preserve the distal blood supply paterson iv one of the most severe consequence of constriction strains is probably intrauterine amputations this is where the constriction goes as deep as the bone and cuts of the blood supply of the proximal extremity the result will be that the developing toe or finger will become ischemic and will fall of because the end result is a transverse amputation that cuts off the vascular supply to the developing extremity  the actual constriction ring is not seen   this can result in different outcomes intrauterine death in extremely rare cases a strain can form around the umbilical cord and cut off the blood supply to the fetus which will result in intrauterine death malformation associated with constriction ring syndrome the percentage of associated anomalies varies from 40 to as high as 80     constriction ring deformities are as common on the lower extremity as on the upper almost all of these involve the musculoskeletal system with clubbed feet being the most common in up to 30 of reported cases      large reported series reveal an incidence between 5 and 15 of craniofacial malformations with clefting of the lip or palate        the reported incidence of constriction ring syndrome varies from 11200 and 115000 live births  the prevalence is equally in male and female  fetomaternal factors like prematurity maternal illnes low birth weight and maternal drug exposure are predisposing factors for the constriction ring syndrome  no positive relationship between crs and genetic inheritance has been reported  surgical correction is recommended when a constriction ring results in a limb contour deformity with or without lymphedema  surgical technique at the beginning of the surgery a tourniquet will be applied to the limb a tourniquet compresses and control the arterial and venous circulation for about 2 hours the constriction band must be dissected very carefully to avoid damaging the underlying neurovasculature when the constriction band is excised there will be a direct closure this allows the fatty tissue to naturally reposition itself under the skin  with complete circumferential constriction bands it is recommended that a twostage correction approach be used at the first operation onehalf of the circumference is excised and the other onehalf can be excised after three to six months this will avoid any problems to the distal circulation in the limb which may already be compromised lymphedema when present will significantly improve within a few weeks of the first surgery   for the direct closure of the defect after dissecting a constriction band there are two different techniques in rare cases if diagnosed in utero fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation or other deformity this typically would not be attempted if neither vital organs nor the umbilical cord were affected this operation has been successfully performed on fetuses as young as 22 weeks  the surgery took place at melbournes monash medical centre in australia and is believed to be the earliest surgery of its type as surgeons usually hold off on operating until the woman is in week 28 of gestation there are also several facilities in the united states that have performed successful amniotic band release surgery

V bronchiectasis is a disease in which there is permanent enlargement of parts of the airways of the lung  symptoms typically include a chronic cough productive of mucus  other symptoms include shortness of breath coughing up blood and chest pain  wheezing and nail clubbing may also occur although clubbing is uncommon  those with the disease often get frequent lung infections  bronchiectasis may result from a number of infective and acquired causes including pneumonia tuberculosis immune system problems and cystic fibrosis   cystic fibrosis eventually results in severe bronchiectasis in nearly all cases  the cause in 1050 of those without cystic fibrosis is unknown the mechanism of disease is breakdown of the airways due to an excessive inflammatory response involved bronchi become enlarged and thus less able to clear secretions these secretions increase the amount of bacteria in the lungs result in airway blockage and further breakdown of the airways  it is classified as an obstructive lung disease along with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma  the diagnosis is suspect based on a persons symptoms and confirmed using computed tomography  sputum cultures may be useful to determine treatment in those who have acute worsening  and at least once a year  worsening may occur due to infection and in these cases antibiotics are recommended typical antibiotics used include amoxicillin and in those who are allergic erythromycin or doxycycline  antibiotics may also be used to prevent worsening of disease  airway clearance techniques a type of physiotherapy are recommended  medications to dilate the airways may be useful in some but the evidence is not very good  the use of inhaled steroids have not been found to be useful  surgery while commonly done has not been well studied  lung transplantation may be an option in those with very severe disease  while the disease may cause significant health problems  many other people with the disease do well  in the united kingdom the disease affects about 1 per 1000 adults  the disease is more common in women and increases as people age it was first described by rene laennec in 1819 the economic costs in the united states are estimated at 630 million per year    some people with bronchiectasis may have a cough productive of frequent greenyellow mucus sputum up to 240ml 8oz daily bronchiectasis may also present with coughing up blood in the absence of sputum called dry bronchiectasis sputum production may also occur without coloration people with bronchiectasis may have bad breath indicative of active infection frequent bronchial infections and breathlessness are two possible indicators of bronchiectasis  crepitations and expiratory rhonchi may be heard on auscultation although nail clubbing is rare  bronchiectasis has both congenital and acquired causes with the latter more frequent  tuberculosis pneumonia inhaled foreign bodies allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bronchial tumours are the major acquired causes of bronchiectasis   infective causes associated with bronchiectasis include infections caused by the staphylococcus klebsiella or bordetella pertussis the causative agent of whooping cough  aspiration of ammonia and other toxic gases pulmonary aspiration alcoholism heroin drug use various allergies all appear to be linked to the development of bronchiectasis   various immunological and lifestyle factors have also been linked to the development of bronchiectasis no cause is identified in up to 50 of noncysticfibrosis related bronchiectasis  bronchiectasis may result from congenital infections that affect cilia motility or ion transport  kartagener syndrome is one such disorder of cilia motility linked to the development of bronchiectasis  a common cause is cystic fibrosis which affects chloride ion transport in which a small number of patients develop severe localized bronchiectasis  youngs syndrome which is clinically similar to cystic fibrosis is thought to significantly contribute to the development of bronchiectasis this is due to the occurrence of chronic infections of the sinuses and bronchiole tree  other lesscommon congenital causes include primary immunodeficiencies due to the weakened or nonexistent immune system response to severe recurrent infections that commonly affect the lung  several other congenital disorders can also lead to bronchiectasis including williamscampbell syndrome  and marfan syndrome  patients with alpha 1antitrypsin deficiency have been found to be particularly susceptible to bronchiectasis for unknown reasons  bronchiectasis is a result of chronic inflammation compounded by an inability to clear mucoid secretions this can be a result of genetic conditions resulting in a failure to clear sputum primary ciliary dyskinesia or resulting in more viscous sputum cystic fibrosis or the result of chronic or severe infections inflammation results in progressive destruction of the normal lung architecture in particular the elastic fibres of bronchi  endobronchial tuberculosis commonly leads to bronchiectasis either from bronchial stenosis or secondary traction from fibrosis  bronchiectasis may be diagnosed clinically or on review of imaging   the british thoracic society recommends all non cysticfibrosisrelated bronchiectasis be confirmed by ct  ct may reveal treeinbud abnormalities dilated bronchi and cysts with defined borders  other investigations typically performed at diagnosis include blood tests sputum cultures and sometimes tests for specific genetic disorders  in order to prevent bronchiectasis children should be immunized against measles pertussis pneumonia and other acute respiratory infections of childhood while smoking has not been found to be a direct cause of bronchiectasis it is certainly an irritant that all patients should avoid in order to prevent the development of infections such as bronchitis and further complications  treatments to slow down the progression of this chronic disease include keeping bronchial airways clear and secretions weakened through various forms of pneumotherapy aggressively treating bronchial infections with antibiotics to prevent the destructive cycle of infection damage to bronchial tubes and more infection is also standard treatment regular vaccination against pneumonia influenza and pertussis are generally advised a healthy body mass index and regular doctor visits may have beneficial effects on the prevention of progressing bronchiectasis the presence of hypoxemia hypercapnia dyspnea level and radiographic extent can greatly affect the mortality rate from this disease  treatment of bronchiectasis includes controlling infections and bronchial secretions relieving airway obstructions removal of affected portions of lung by surgical removal or artery embolization and preventing complications this includes the prolonged usage of antibiotics to prevent detrimental infections  as well as eliminating accumulated fluid with postural drainage and chest physiotherapy postural drainage techniques aided by physiotherapists and respiratory therapists are an important mainstay of treatment   airway clearance techniques appear useful  surgery may also be used to treat localized bronchiectasis removing obstructions that could cause progression of the disease  inhaled steroid therapy that is consistently adhered to can reduce sputum production and decrease airway constriction over a period of time and help prevent progression of bronchiectasis this is not recommended for routine use in children  one commonly used therapy is beclometasone dipropionate  although not approved for use in any country mannitol dry inhalation powder has been granted orphan drug status by the fda for use in people with bronchiectasis and with cystic fibrosis  in the united kingdom the disease affects about 1 per 1000 adults  rené laennec the man who invented the stethoscope used his invention to first discover bronchiectasis in 1819  the disease was researched in greater detail by sir william osler in the late 1800s it is suspected that osler actually died of complications from undiagnosed bronchiectasis

V hydrocephalus from greek hydro meaning water and kephalos meaning head is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid csf in the brain this causes increased intracranial pressure inside the skull and may cause progressive enlargement of the head if it occurs in childhood potentially causing convulsion tunnel vision and mental disability it was once informally called water on the brain  hydrocephalus can be caused by congenital or acquired factors congenital causes include spina bifida arnoldchiari malformation craniosynostosis dandywalker syndrome and vein of galen malformations acquired causes include hemorrhage meningitis head trauma tumors and cysts two types of hydrocephalus are commonly described noncommunicating hydrocephalus and communicating hydrocephalus although there is evidence that communicating forms can lead to obstruction of csf flow in many instances in noncommunicating hydrocephalus the csf in the ventricles can not reach the subarachnoid space this results from obstruction of interventricular foramina cerebral aqueduct or the outflow foramens of the fourth ventricle median and lateral apertures the most common obstruction is in the cerebral aqueduct a block at any of these sites leads rapidly to dilatation of one or more ventricles if the skull is still pliable as it is in children younger than two years the head may enlarge in communicating hydrocephalus the obstruction of csf flow is in the subarachnoid space from prior bleeding or meningitis this causes thickening of the arachnoid leading to blockage of the returnflow channels in some patients the spaces filled by csf are uniformly enlarged without an increase in intercranial pressure this special form of communicating hydrocephalus is called normal pressure hydrocephalus nph which results specifically from impaired csf reabsorption at the arachnoid granulations nphs clinical manifestations are gait abnormality dementia and involuntary urination nph usually occurs in elderly patients   the clinical presentation of hydrocephalus varies with chronicity acute dilatation of the ventricular system is more likely to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure by contrast chronic dilatation especially in the elderly population may have a more insidious onset presenting for instance with hakims triad adams triad symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may include headaches vomiting nausea papilledema sleepiness or coma elevated intracranial pressure may result in uncal andor cerebellar tonsill herniation with resulting lifethreatening brain stem compression hakims triad of gait instability urinary incontinence and dementia is a relatively typical manifestation of the distinct entity normal pressure hydrocephalus nph focal neurological deficits may also occur such as abducens nerve palsy and vertical gaze palsy parinaud syndrome due to compression of the quadrigeminal plate where the neural centers coordinating the conjugated vertical eye movement are located the symptoms depend on the cause of the blockage the persons age and how much brain tissue has been damaged by the swelling in infants with hydrocephalus csf builds up in the central nervous system causing the fontanelle soft spot to bulge and the head to be larger than expected early symptoms may also include symptoms that may occur in older children can include because hydrocephalus can injure the brain thought and behavior may be adversely affected learning disabilities including shortterm memory loss are common among those with hydrocephalus who tend to score better on verbal iq than on performance iq which is thought to reflect the distribution of nerve damage to the brain however the severity of hydrocephalus can differ considerably between individuals and some are of average or aboveaverage intelligence someone with hydrocephalus may have motion and visual problems problems with coordination or may be clumsy they may reach puberty earlier than the average child see precocious puberty about one in four develops epilepsy the cause of hydrocephalus is not known with certainty and is probably multifactorial it may be caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid csf flow reabsorption or excessive csf production based on its underlying mechanisms hydrocephalus can be classified into communicating and noncommunicating obstructive both forms can be either congenital or acquired communicating hydrocephalus also known as nonobstructive hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption in the absence of any csfflow obstruction between the ventricles and subarachnoid space it has been theorized that this is due to functional impairment of the arachnoidal granulations also called arachnoid granulations or pacchionis granulations which are located along the superior sagittal sinus and is the site of cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption back into the venous system various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus including subarachnoidintraventricular hemorrhage meningitis and congenital absence of arachnoid villi scarring and fibrosis of the subarachnoid space following infectious inflammatory or hemorrhagic events can also prevent resorption of csf causing diffuse ventricular dilatation noncommunicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus is caused by a csfflow obstruction the cranial bones fuse by the end of the third year of life for head enlargement to occur hydrocephalus must occur before then the causes are usually genetic but can also be acquired and usually occur within the first few months of life which include 1 intraventricular matrix hemorrhages in premature infants 2 infections 3 type ii arnoldchiari malformation 4 aqueduct atresia and stenosis and 5 dandywalker malformation in newborns and toddlers with hydrocephalus the head circumference is enlarged rapidly and soon surpasses the 97th percentile since the skull bones have not yet firmly joined together bulging firm anterior and posterior fontanelles may be present even when the patient is in an upright position the infant exhibits fretfulness poor feeding and frequent vomiting as the hydrocephalus progresses torpor sets in and the infant shows lack of interest in his surroundings later on the upper eyelids become retracted and the eyes are turned downwards sunset eyes due to hydrocephalic pressure on the mesencephalic tegmentum and paralysis of upward gaze movements become weak and the arms may become tremulous papilledema is absent but there may be reduction of vision the head becomes so enlarged that the child may eventually be bedridden about 8090 of fetuses or newborn infants with spina bifidaoften associated with meningocele or myelomeningoceledevelop hydrocephalus  this condition is acquired as a consequence of cns infections meningitis brain tumors head trauma intracranial hemorrhage subarachnoid or intraparenchymal and is usually extremely painful hydrocephalus is usually due to blockage of cerebrospinal fluid csf outflow in the ventricles or in the subarachnoid space over the brain in a person without hydrocephalus csf continuously circulates through the brain its ventricles and the spinal cord and is continuously drained away into the circulatory system alternatively the condition may result from an overproduction of the csf from a congenital malformation blocking normal drainage of the fluid or from complications of head injuries or infections  compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually may cause neurological symptoms such as convulsions intellectual disability and epileptic seizures these signs occur sooner in adults whose skulls are no longer able to expand to accommodate the increasing fluid volume within fetuses infants and young children with hydrocephalus typically have an abnormally large head excluding the face because the pressure of the fluid causes the individual skull bones  which have yet to fuse  to bulge outward at their juncture points another medical sign in infants is a characteristic fixed downward gaze with whites of the eyes showing above the iris as though the infant were trying to examine its own lower eyelids  the elevated intracranial pressure may cause compression of the brain leading to brain damage and other complications conditions among affected individuals vary widely if the foramina of the fourth ventricle or the cerebral aqueduct are blocked cereobrospinal fluid csf can accumulate within the ventricles this condition is called internal hydrocephalus and it results in increased csf pressure the production of csf continues even when the passages that normally allow it to exit the brain are blocked consequently fluid builds inside the brain causing pressure that dilates the ventricles and compresses the nervous tissue compression of the nervous tissue usually results in irreversible brain damage if the skull bones are not completely ossified when the hydrocephalus occurs the pressure may also severely enlarge the head the cerebral aqueduct may be blocked at the time of birth or may become blocked later in life because of a tumor growing in the brainstem internal hydrocephalus can be successfully treated by placing a drainage tube shunt between the brain ventricles and abdominal cavity to eliminate the high intracranial pressure there is some risk of infection being introduced into the brain through these shunts however and the shunts must be replaced as the person grows a subarachnoid hemorrhage may block the return of csf to the circulation this should be distinguished from external hydrocephalus this is a condition generally seen in infants and involving enlarged fluid spaces or subarachnoid spaces around the outside of the brain this is generally a benign condition that resolves spontaneously by 2 years of age greenberg handbook of neurosurgery 5th edition pg 174  imaging studies and a good medical history can help to differentiate external hydrocephalus from subdural hemorrhages or symptomatic chronic extraaxial fluid collections which are accompanied by vomiting headaches and seizures hydrocephalus treatment is surgical generally utilizing various types of cerebral shunts it involves the placement of a ventricular catheter a tube made of silastic into the cerebral ventricles to bypass the flow obstructionmalfunctioning arachnoidal granulations and drain the excess fluid into other body cavities from where it can be resorbed most shunts drain the fluid into the peritoneal cavity ventriculoperitoneal shunt but alternative sites include the right atrium ventriculoatrial shunt pleural cavity ventriculopleural shunt and gallbladder a shunt system can also be placed in the lumbar space of the spine and have the csf redirected to the peritoneal cavity lumbarperitoneal shunt  an alternative treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus in selected patients is the endoscopic third ventriculostomy etv whereby a surgically created opening in the floor of the third ventricle allows the csf to flow directly to the basal cisterns thereby shortcutting any obstruction as in aqueductal stenosis this may or may not be appropriate based on individual anatomy examples of possible complications include shunt malfunction shunt failure and shunt infection along with infection of the shunt tract following surgery the most common reason for shunt failure is infection of the shunt tract although a shunt generally works well it may stop working if it disconnects becomes blocked clogged infected or it is outgrown if this happens the cerebrospinal fluid will begin to accumulate again and a number of physical symptoms will develop headaches nausea vomiting photophobialight sensitivity some extremely serious like seizures the shunt failure rate is also relatively high of the 40000 surgeries performed annually to treat hydrocephalus only 30 are a patients first surgery and it is not uncommon for patients to have multiple shunt revisions within their lifetime another complication can occur when csf drains more rapidly than it is produced by the choroid plexus causing symptoms  listlessness severe headaches irritability light sensitivity auditory hyperesthesia sound sensitivity nausea vomiting dizziness vertigo migraines seizures a change in personality weakness in the arms or legs strabismus and double vision  to appear when the patient is vertical if the patient lies down the symptoms usually vanish quickly a ct scan may or may not show any change in ventricle size particularly if the patient has a history of slitlike ventricles difficulty in diagnosing overdrainage can make treatment of this complication particularly frustrating for patients and their families resistance to traditional analgesic pharmacological therapy may also be a sign of shunt overdrainage or failure the diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid buildup is complex and requires specialist expertise diagnosis of the particular complication usually depends on when the symptoms appear  that is whether symptoms occur when the patient is upright or in a prone position with the head at roughly the same level as the feet because the shunt systems are too expensive for most people in developing countries such people often die without getting a shunt worse the rate of revision in shunt systems adds to the cost of shunting many times looking at this point a study done by dr benjamin c warf compares shunt systems and highlights the role of lowcost shunt systems in most of the developing countries this study was published in journal of neurosurgery pediatrics may 2005 issue  it compares the chhabra shunt system to shunt systems from developed countries the study was done in uganda and the shunts were donated by the international federation for spina bifida and hydrocephalus references to hydrocephalic skulls can be found in ancient egyptian medical literature from 2500 bc to 500 ad  hydrocephalus was described more clearly by the ancient greek physician hippocrates in the 4th century bc while a more accurate description was later given by the roman physician galen in the 2nd century ad  the first clinical description of an operative procedure for hydrocephalus appears in the altasrif 1000 ad by the arab surgeon abulcasis who clearly described the evacuation of superficial intracranial fluid in hydrocephalic children  he described it in his chapter on neurosurgical disease describing infantile hydrocephalus as being caused by mechanical compression he wrote  the skull of a newborn baby is often full of liquid either because the matron has compressed it excessively or for other unknown reasons the volume of the skull then increases daily so that the bones of the skull fail to close in this case we must open the middle of the skull in three places make the liquid flow out then close the wound and tighten the skull with a bandage in 1881 a few years after the landmark study of retzius and key carl wernicke pioneered sterile ventricular puncture and external drainage of cerebrospinal fluid for the treatment of hydrocephalus  it remained an intractable condition until the 20th century when shunts and other neurosurgical treatment modalities were developed it is a lesserknown medical condition relatively little research is conducted to improve treatment and there is still no cure in developing countries the condition often goes untreated at birth before birth the condition is difficult to diagnose and there is limited access to medical treatment however when head swelling is prominent children are taken at great expense for treatment by then brain tissue is undeveloped and neurosurgery is rare and difficult children more commonly live with undeveloped brain tissue and consequential intellectual disability september was designated national hydrocephalus awareness month in july 2009 by the us congress in hr373 the resolution campaign is due in part to the advocacy work of the pediatric hydrocephalus foundation inc prior to july 2009 there was no awareness month for this condition many of the hydrocephalus organizations within the united states use various ribbon designs as a part of their awareness and fundraising activities one interesting case of hydrocephalus was a man whose brain shrank to a thin sheet of tissue due to buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in his skull as a child the man had a shunt but it was removed when he was 14 in july 2007 at age 44 he went to a hospital due to mild weakness in his left leg when doctors learned of the mans medical history they performed a computed tomography ct scan and magnetic resonance imaging mri scan and were astonished to see massive enlargement of the lateral ventricles in the skull dr lionel feuillet of hôpital de la timone in marseille said the images were most unusual the brain was virtually absent  intelligence tests showed the patient had an iq of 75 below the average score of 100 this would be considered borderline intellectual functioning just above what would be officially considered mentally challenged the patient was a married father of two children and worked as a civil servant leading an at least superficially normal life despite having enlarged ventricles with a decreased volume of brain tissue what i find amazing to this day is how the brain can deal with something which you think should not be compatible with life commented dr max muenke a pediatric brain defect specialist at the national human genome research institute if something happens very slowly over quite some time maybe over decades the different parts of the brain take up functions that would normally be done by the part that is pushed to the side

V spina bifida latin split spine is a birth defect where there is incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord there are three main types spina bifida occulta meningocele and myelomeningocele  the most common location is the lower back but in rare cases it may be the middle back or neck  occulta has no or only mild signs  signs of occulta may include a hairy patch dimple dark spot or swelling on the back at the site of the gap in the spine meningocele typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine  myelomeningocele also known as open spina bifida is the most severe form associated problems include poor ability to walk problems with bladder or bowel control hydrocephalus a tethered spinal cord and latex allergy  learning problems are relatively uncommon  spina bifida is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors  after having one child with the condition or if one of the parents has the condition there is a 4 chance that the next child will also be affected  not having enough folate in the diet during pregnancy also plays a significant role  other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications obesity and poorly controlled diabetes  diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born before birth if a blood test or amniocentesis finds a high level of alphafetoprotein afp there is a higher risk of spina bifida ultrasound examination may also detect the problem medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth  it is a type of neural tube defect with other types including anencephaly and encephalocele  most cases of spina bifida can be prevented if the mother gets enough folate before and during pregnancy  adding folic acid to flour has been found to be effective for most women  open spina bifida can be surgically closed before or after birth a shunt may be needed in those with hydrocephalus and a tethered spinal cord may be surgically repaired devices to help with movement such as crutches or wheelchairs may be useful urinary catheterization may also be needed  about 5 of people have spina bifida occulta  rates of other types of spina bifida vary significantly by country from 01 to 5 per 1000 births  on average in developed countries it occurs in about 04 per 1000 births  in the united states it affected about 07 per 1000 births  and in india about 19 per 1000 births  part of this difference is believed to be due to race  with caucasians at higher risk  and partly due to environmental factors  occulta is latin for hidden this is the mildest form of spina bifida  in occulta the outer part of some of the vertebrae is not completely closed  the splits in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does not protrude the skin at the site of the lesion may be normal or it may have some hair growing from it there may be a dimple in the skin or a birthmark  many people with this type of spina bifida do not even know they have it as the condition is asymptomatic in most cases  the incidence of spina bifida occulta is approximately 1020 of the population   and most people are diagnosed incidentally from spinal xrays a systematic review of radiographic research studies found no relationship between spina bifida occulta and back pain  more recent studies not included in the review support the negative findings    however other studies suggest spina bifida occulta is not always harmless one study found that among patients with back pain severity is worse if spina bifida occulta is present   among females this could be mistaken for dysmenorrhea incomplete posterior fusion is not a true spina bifida and is very rarely of neurological significance  a posterior meningocele pronounced m\u0259\u02c8n\u026a\u014b\u0261\u0259\u02ccsil or meningeal cyst pronounced m\u026a\u02c8n\u026and\u0292i\u0259l s\u026ast is the least common form of spina bifida in this form the vertebrae develop normally but the meninges are forced into the gaps between the vertebrae as the nervous system remains undamaged individuals with meningocele are unlikely to suffer longterm health problems although cases of tethered cord have been reported causes of meningocele include teratoma and other tumors of the sacrococcyx and of the presacral space and currarino syndrome a meningocele may also form through dehiscences in the base of the skull these may be classified by their localisation to occipital frontoethmoidal or nasal endonasal meningoceles lie at the roof of the nasal cavity and may be mistaken for a nasal polyp they are treated surgically encephalomeningoceles are classified in the same way and also contain brain tissue myelomeningocele also known as meningomyelocele is type of spina bifida that often results in the most severe complications  in individuals with myelomeningocele the unfused portion of the spinal column allows the spinal cord to protrude through an opening the meningeal membranes that cover the spinal cord also protrude through the opening forming a sac enclosing the spinal elements spina bifida with myeloschisis is the most severe form of myelomeningocele in this type the involved area is represented by a flattened platelike mass of nervous tissue with no overlying membrane the exposure of these nerves and tissues make the baby more prone to lifethreatening infections such as meningitis  the protruding portion of the spinal cord and the nerves that originate at that level of the cord are damaged or not properly developed as a result there is usually some degree of paralysis and loss of sensation below the level of the spinal cord defect thus the more cranial the level of the defect the more severe the associated nerve dysfunction and resultant paralysis may be people may have ambulatory problems loss of sensation deformities of the hips knees or feet and loss of muscle tone xray image of spina bifida occulta in s1 xray computed tomography scan of unfused arch at c1 myelomeningocele in the lumbar area1 external sac with cerebrospinal fluid2 spinal cord wedged between the vertebrae physical signs of spina bifida may include 68 of children with spina bifida have an allergy to latex  ranging from mild to lifethreatening the common use of latex in medical facilities makes this a particularly serious concern the most common approach to avoid developing an allergy is to avoid contact with latexcontaining products such as examination gloves and condoms and catheters that do not specify they are latex free and many other products such as some commonly used by dentists  the spinal cord lesion or the scarring due to surgery may result in a tethered spinal cord in some individuals this causes significant traction and stress on the spinal cord and can lead to a worsening of associated paralysis scoliosis back pain and worsening bowel andor bladder function  many individuals with spina bifida have an associated abnormality of the cerebellum called the arnold chiari ii malformation in affected individuals the back portion of the brain is displaced from the back of the skull down into the upper neck in about 90 of the people with myelomeningocele hydrocephalus also occurs because the displaced cerebellum interferes with the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid causing an excess of the fluid to accumulate  in fact the cerebellum also tends to be smaller in individuals with spina bifida especially for those with higher lesion levels  the corpus callosum is abnormally developed in 7090 of individuals with spina bifida myelomeningocele this affects the communication processes between the left and right brain hemispheres  further white matter tracts connecting posterior brain regions with anterior regions appear less organized white matter tracts between frontal regions have also been found to be impaired  cortex abnormalities may also be present for example frontal regions of the brain tend to be thicker than expected while posterior and parietal regions are thinner thinner sections of the brain are also associated with increased cortical folding  neurons within the cortex may also be displaced  several studies have demonstrated difficulties with executive functions in youth with spina bifida   with greater deficits observed in youth with shunted hydrocephalus  unlike typically developing children youths with spina bifida do not tend to improve in their executive functioning as they grow older  specific areas of difficulty in some individuals include planning organizing initiating and working memory problemsolving abstraction and visual planning may also be impaired  further children with spina bifida may have poor cognitive flexibility although executive functions are often attributed to the frontal lobes of the brain individuals with spina bifida have intact frontal lobes therefore other areas of the brain may be implicated  individuals with spina bifida especially those with shunted hydrocephalus often have attention problems children with spina bifida and shunted hydrocephalus have higher rates of adhd than children without those conditions 31 vs 17  deficits have been observed for selective attention and focused attention although poor motor speed may contribute to poor scores on tests of attention   attention deficits may be evident at a very early age as infants with spina bifida lag behind their peers in orienting to faces  individuals with spina bifida may struggle academically especially in the subjects of mathematics and reading in one study 60 of children with spina bifida were diagnosed with a learning disability  in addition to brain abnormalities directly related to various academic skills achievement is likely affected by impaired attentional control and executive functioning  children with spina bifida may perform well in elementary school but begin to struggle as academic demands increase children with spina bifida are more likely than their peers without spina bifida to be dyscalculic  individuals with spina bifida have demonstrated stable difficulties with arithmetic accuracy and speed mathematical problemsolving and general use and understanding of numbers in everyday life  mathematics difficulties may be directly related to the thinning of the parietal lobes regions implicated in mathematical functioning and indirectly associated with deformities of the cerebellum and midbrain that affect other functions involved in mathematical skills further higher numbers of shunt revisions are associated with poorer mathematics abilities  working memory and inhibitory control deficiencies have been implicated for math difficulties  although visualspatial difficulties are not likely involved  early intervention to address mathematics difficulties and associated executive functions is crucial  individuals with spina bifida tend to have better reading skills than mathematics skills  children and adults with spina bifida have stronger abilities in reading accuracy than in reading comprehension  comprehension may be especially impaired for text that requires an abstract synthesis of information rather than a more literal understanding  individuals with spina bifida may have difficulty with writing due to deficits in fine motor control and working memory  spina bifida is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors  after having one child with the condition or if a parent has the condition there is a 4 chance the next child will also be affected  not having enough folic acid during pregnancy also plays a significant role  other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications obesity and poorly controlled diabetes  spina bifida is sometimes caused by the failure of the neural tube to close during the first month of embryonic development often before the mother knows she is pregnant some forms are known to occur with primary conditions that cause raised central nervous system pressure which raises the possibility of a dual pathogenesis  in normal circumstances the closure of the neural tube occurs around the 23rd rostral closure and 27th caudal closure day after fertilization  however if something interferes and the tube fails to close properly a neural tube defect will occur medications such as some anticonvulsants diabetes having a relative with spina bifida obesity and an increased body temperature from fever or external sources such as hot tubs and electric blankets may increase the chances of delivery of a baby with a spina bifida  extensive evidence from mouse strains with spina bifida indicates that there is sometimes a genetic basis for the condition human spina bifida like other human diseases such as cancer hypertension and atherosclerosis coronary artery disease likely results from the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors  research has shown the lack of folic acid folate is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects including spina bifida supplementation of the mothers diet with folate can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by about 70 and can also decrease the severity of these defects when they occur    it is unknown how or why folic acid has this effect spina bifida does not follow direct patterns of heredity like muscular dystrophy or haemophilia studies show a woman having had one child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida has about a 3 risk of having another affected child this risk can be reduced with folic acid supplementation before pregnancy for the general population lowdose folic acid supplements are advised 04mgday  there is neither a single cause of spina bifida nor any known way to prevent it entirely however dietary supplementation with folic acid has been shown to be helpful in reducing the incidence of spina bifida sources of folic acid include whole grains fortified breakfast cereals dried beans leaf vegetables and fruits  folate fortification of enriched grain products has been mandatory in the united states since 1998 the us food and drug administration public health agency of canada  and uk recommended amount of folic acid for women of childbearing age and women planning to become pregnant is at least 04mgday of folic acid from at least three months before conception and continued for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy  women who have already had a baby with spina bifida or other type of neural tube defect or are taking anticonvulsant medication should take a higher dose of 45mgday  certain mutations in the gene vangl1 are implicated as a risk factor for spina bifida these mutations have been linked with spina bifida in some families with a history of spina bifida  open spina bifida can usually be detected during pregnancy by fetal ultrasound increased levels of maternal serum alphafetoprotein msafp should be followed up by two tests  an ultrasound of the fetal spine and amniocentesis of the mothers amniotic fluid to test for alphafetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase afp tests are now mandated by some state laws including california and failure to provide them can have legal ramifications in one case a man born with spina bifida was awarded a 2 million settlement after court found his mothers obgyn negligent for not performing these tests  spina bifida may be associated with other malformations as in dysmorphic syndromes often resulting in spontaneous miscarriage in the majority of cases though spina bifida is an isolated malformation genetic counseling and further genetic testing such as amniocentesis may be offered during the pregnancy as some neural tube defects are associated with genetic disorders such as trisomy 18 ultrasound screening for spina bifida is partly responsible for the decline in new cases because many pregnancies are terminated out of fear that a newborn might have a poor future quality of life with modern medical care the quality of life of patients has greatly improved  threedimensional ultrasound image of the fetal spine at 21 weeks of pregnancy ultrasound view of the fetal spine at 21 weeks of pregnancy in the longitudinal scan a lumbar myelomeningocele is seen there is no known cure for nerve damage caused by spina bifida standard treatment is surgery after delivery this surgery aims to prevent further damage of the nervous tissue and to prevent infection pediatric neurosurgeons operate to close the opening on the back the spinal cord and its nerve roots are put back inside the spine and covered with meninges in addition a shunt may be surgically installed to provide a continuous drain for the excess cerebrospinal fluid produced in the brain as happens with hydrocephalus shunts most commonly drain into the abdomen or chest wall standard treatment is after delivery there is tentative evidence about treatment before delivery while the baby is inside the womb for severe disease  as of 2014 the evidence however remains insufficient to determine benefits and harms  treatment of spina bifida during pregnancy in not without risk  to the mother this includes scarring of the uterus  to the baby there is the risk of preterm birth  broadly there are two forms of prenatal treatment the first is open fetal surgery where the uterus is opened and the spina bifida repair performed the second is via fetoscopy these techniques may be an option to standard therapy  most individuals with myelomeningocele will need periodic evaluations by a variety of specialists  although many childrens hospitals feature integrated multidisciplinary teams to coordinate healthcare of youth with spina bifida the transition to adult healthcare can be difficult because the above healthcare professionals operate independently of each other requiring separate appointments and communicate among each other much less frequently healthcare professionals working with adults may also be less knowledgeable about spina bifida because it is considered a childhood chronic health condition  due to the potential difficulties of the transition adolescents with spina bifida and their families are encouraged to begin to prepare for the transition around ages 1416 although this may vary depending on the adolescents cognitive and physical abilities and available family support the transition itself should be gradual and flexible the adolescents multidisciplinary treatment team may aid in the process by preparing comprehensive uptodate documents detailing the adolescents medical care including information about medications surgery therapies and recommendations a transition plan and aid in identifying adult healthcare professionals are also helpful to include in the transition process  further complicating the transition process is the tendency for youths with spina bifida to be delayed in the development of autonomy  with boys particularly at risk for slower development of independence  an increased dependence on others in particular family members may interfere with the adolescents selfmanagement of healthrelated tasks such as catheterization bowel management and taking medications  as part of the transition process it is beneficial to begin discussions at an early age about educational and vocational goals independent living and community involvement  about 5 of people have spina bifida occulta  rates of other types of spina bifida vary significantly by country from 01 to 5 per 1000 births  on average in developed countries it occurs in about 04 per 1000 births  in the united states it affected about 07 per 1000 births  and in india about 19 per 1000 births  part of this difference is believed to be due to race with caucasians at higher risk and part due to environmental factors  in the united states rates are higher on the east coast than on the west coast and higher in white people one case per 1000 live births than in black people 0104 case per 1000 live births immigrants from ireland have a higher incidence of spina bifida than do natives   highest rates of the defect in the usa can be found in hispanic youth  the highest incidence rates worldwide were found in ireland and wales where three to four cases of myelomeningocele per 1000 population have been reported during the 1970s along with more than six cases of anencephaly both live births and stillbirths per 1000 population the reported overall incidence of myelomeningocele in the british isles was 2035 cases per 1000 births   since then the rate has fallen dramatically with 015 per 1000 live births reported in 1998  though this decline is partially accounted for because some fetuses are aborted when tests show signs of spina bifida see pregnancy screening above surgeons at vanderbilt university led by joseph bruner attempted to close spina bifida in 4 human fetuses using a skin graft from the mother using a laparoscope four cases were performed before stopping the procedure  two of the four fetuses died  fetal surgery after 25 weeks has not shown benefit in subsequent studies  management of myelomeningocele study moms was a phase iii clinical trial designed to compare two approaches to the treatment of spina bifida surgery before birth and surgery after birth   the trial concluded that the outcomes after prenatal spina bifida treatment are improved to the degree that the benefits of the surgery outweigh the maternal risks this conclusion requires a value judgment on the relative value of fetal and maternal outcomes on which opinion is still divided  to be specific the study found that prenatal repair resulted in   at one year of age 40 percent of the children in the prenatal surgery group had received a shunt compared to 83 percent of the children in the postnatal group during pregnancy all the fetuses in the trial had hindbrain herniation however at age 12 months onethird 36 percent of the infants in the prenatal surgery group no longer had any evidence of hindbrain herniation compared to only 4 percent in the postnatal surgery group  further surveillance is ongoing  in contrast to the open fetal operative approach performed in the moms trial a minimally invasive fetoscopic approach akin to keyhole surgery has been developed this approach has been evaluated by independent authors of a controlled study which showed some benefit in survivors  but others are more skeptical  the observations in mothers and their fetuses that were operated over the past two and a half years by the matured minimally invasive approach showed the following results compared to the open fetal surgery technique fetoscopic repair of myelomeningocele results in far less surgical trauma to the mother as large incisions of her abdomen and uterus are not required in contrast the initial punctures have a diameter of 12mm only as a result thinning of the uterine wall or dehisscence which have been among the most worriesome and criticized complications after the open operative approach do not occur following minimally invasive fetoscopic closure of spina bifida aperta the risks of maternal chorioamniotis or fetal death as a result of the fetoscopic procedure run below 5    women are discharged home from hospital one week after the procedure there is no need for chronic administration of tocolytic agents since postoperative uterine contractions are barely ever observed the current cost of the entire fetoscopic procedure including hospital stay drugs perioperative clinical ecg ultrasound and mriexaminations is approximately 16000 in 2012 these results of the fetoscopic approach were presented at various national and international meetings among them at the 1st european symposium fetal surgery for spina bifida in april 2012 in giessen at the 15th congress of the german society for prenatal medicine and obstetrics in may 2012 in bonn  at the world congress of the fetal medicine foundation in june 2012  and at the world congress of the international society of obstetrics and gynecology isuog in copenhagen in september 2012  and published in abstract form         since then more data has emerged in 2014 two papers were published on fifty one patients   these papers suggested that the risk to the mother is small the main risk appears to be preterm labour on average at about 33 weeks

V a hiatus hernia or hiatal hernia is the protrusion or herniation of the upper part of the stomach into the thorax through a tear or weakness in the diaphragm hiatus hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating  the most common cause is obesity the diagnosis is often by endoscopy or medical imaging  a hiatus hernia may be treated with lifestyle changes such as raising the head of the bed weight loss and adjusting eating habits medications such as h2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may help if the symptoms do not improve with medications the surgery known as laparoscopic fundoplication may be an option  it is not known how commonly hiatus hernias occur with estimates in north america varying from 10 to 80    hiatal hernia has often been called the great mimic because its symptoms can resemble many disorders for example a person with this problem can experience dull pains in the chest shortness of breath caused by the hernias effect on the diaphragm heart palpitations due to irritation of the vagus nerve and swallowed food balling up and causing discomfort in lower esophagus until it passes on to stomach in most cases however a hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms the pain and discomfort that a patient experiences is due to the reflux of gastric acid air or bile while there are several causes of acid reflux it does happen more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia for newborn the presence of bochdalek hernia can be recognised  from symptoms such as difficulty breathing  fast respiration increased heart rate  the following are risk factors that can result in a hiatus hernia  the diagnosis of a hiatus hernia is typically made through an upper gi series endoscopy or high resolution manometry a large hiatus hernia on xray marked by open arrows in contrast to the heart borders marked by closed arrows upper gi endoscopy depicting hiatus hernia a hiatus hernia as seen on ct four types of esophageal hiatal hernia are identified  type i with type i there is a widening of the muscular hiatal tunnel and circumferential laxity of the phrenoesophageal membrane allowing a portion of the gastric cardia to hernia upward into the posterior mediastinum the clinical significance of type i hernias is in their association with reflux disease they are the most common type accounting for 9585 of all hiatal hernias c type ii a type ii hernia results from a localized defect in the phrenoesophageal membrane while the gastroesophageal junction remains fixed to the pre aortic fascia and the median arcuate ligament the gastric funds then serves as the leading point of herniation although type ii hernias are associated with reflux disease their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications d type iii type iii hernias have elements of both types i and ii hernias with progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus the phrenoesophageal membrane stretches displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm thereby adding a sliding element to the type ii hernia type iv type iv hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal membrane allowing other organs such as colon spleen pancreas and small intestine to enter the hernia sac the end stage of type i and type ii hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up into the chest by rotating 180 around its longitudinal axis with the cardia and pylorus as fixed points in this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach in most cases sufferers experience no discomfort and no treatment is required if there is pain or discomfort 3 or 4 sips of room temperature water will usually relieve the pain however when the hiatal hernia is large or is of the paraesophageal type it is likely to cause esophageal stricture and discomfort symptomatic patients should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals if the condition has been brought on by stress stress reduction techniques may be prescribed or if overweight weight loss may be indicated medications that reduce the lower esophageal sphincter les pressure should be avoided antisecretory drugs like proton pump inhibitors and h2 receptor blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion where hernia symptoms are severe and chronic acid reflux is involved surgery is sometimes recommended as chronic reflux can severely injure the esophagus and even lead to esophageal cancer the surgical procedure used is called nissen fundoplication in fundoplication the gastric fundus upper part of the stomach is wrapped or plicated around the inferior part of the esophagus preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of gastric acid the procedure is now commonly performed laparoscopically with proper patient selection laparoscopic fundoplication recent studies have indicated low complication rates quick recovery and relatively good long term results      complications include gas bloat syndrome dysphagia trouble swallowing dumping syndrome excessive scarring and rarely achalasia the procedure sometimes fails over time requiring a second surgery to make repairs incidence of hiatal hernias increases with age approximately 60 of individuals aged 50 or older have a hiatal hernia  of these 9 are symptomatic depending on the competence of the lower esophageal sphincter les 95 of these are sliding hiatus hernias in which the les protrudes above the diaphragm along with the stomach and only 5 are the rolling type paraesophageal in which the les remains stationary but the stomach protrudes above the diaphragm people of all ages can get this condition but it is more common in older people according to dr denis burkitt hiatus hernia has its maximum prevalence in economically developed communities in north america and western europe in contrast the disease is rare in situations typified by rural african communities  burkitt attributes the disease to insufficient dietary fiber and the use of the unnatural sitting position for defecation both factors create the need for straining at stool increasing intraabdominal pressure and pushing the stomach through the esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm

V a mongolian spot also known as mongolian blue spot congenital dermal melanocytosis  and dermal melanocytosis  is a benign flat congenital birthmark with wavy borders and irregular shape in 1883 it was described and named after mongolians by erwin bälz a german anthropologist based in japan     it normally disappears three to five years after birth and almost always by puberty  the most common color is blue although they can be bluegray blueblack or deep brown   the mongolian spot is a congenital developmental condition  that is one existing from birth  exclusively involving the skin the blue colour is caused by melanocytes melanincontaining cells that are usually located in the surface of the skin the epidermis but are in the deeper region the dermis in the location of the spot  usually as multiple spots or one large patch it covers one or more of the lumbosacral area lower back the buttocks sides and shoulders  it results from the entrapment of melanocytes in the lower half to twothirds of the dermis during their migration from the neural crest to the epidermis during embryonic development  male and female infants are equally predisposed to mongolian spot  people who are not aware of the background of the mongolian spots may mistake them for bruises possibly resulting in unfounded concerns about abuse    infants may be born with one or more mongolian spots ranging from small area on the buttocks to a larger area on the back the spot is prevalent among east southeast north and central asian peoples malay archipelago islanders indigenous oceanians chiefly micronesians and polynesians africans  amerindians  east africans latin americans and caribbeans of mixedrace descent and turkish people    they occur in about 9095 of asian and 8085 native american infants  approximately 90 of polynesians and micronesians are born with mongolian spots as are about 46 of children in latin america  where they are associated with noneuropean descent these spots also appear on 510 of babies of full caucasian descent coria del río in spain has a high incidence due to the presence of descendants of the first japanese official envoy to spain in the early 17th century   black babies have mongolian spots at a frequency of 96  almost the entire mestizo mixed spanishindian people of mexico have the mongolian spot  central americans indigenous children were subjected to racism due to their mongolian spots but progressive circles began to make having the mongolian spot popular after the late 1960s  highland peruvians have the mongolian spot  the french anthropologist robert gessain interested himself in what he called the tache pigmentaire congenitale or coloured birthmark publishing multiple papers in the journal de la société des américanistes an academic journal covering the cultural anthropology of the americas gessain spent time with the huehuetla tepehua people in hidalgo mexico and wrote in 1947 about the spots location shape colour histology chemistry genetic transmission and racial distribution he had previously spent several winters in greenland and wrote an overview in 1953 of what was known about the spot he hypothesised that the age at which it faded in various populations might prove to be a distinguishing characteristic of those groups gessain claimed that the spot was first observed amongst the eskimo  hans egede saabye a danish priest and botanist spent 17701778 in greenland his diaries published in 1816 and translated into several european languages contained much ethnographic information he described the spot on newborns saying he had seen it often when the infants were presented naked for baptism a second danish observer was doctor and zoologist daniel frederik eschricht mainly based in copenhagen in 1849 he wrote of the mixed babies he had delivered at the lyingin hospital he also says that the observation made for the first time by saabye about eskimo children has been completely confirmed by captain holbøll who sent him a fetus pickled in alcohol   gessain goes on to state that it was only in 1883 that an anthropologist mentions the spot it was erwin bälz a german working in tokyo who described a dark blue mark on japanese infants he presented his findings in 1901 in berlin and from that point on bälzs name was associated with certain skin cells containing pigment captain gustav frederik holm wrote in 1887 that his greenlandic interpreter johannes hansen known as hanserak attested to the existence of the birthmark over the kidney region of newborns which grows larger as they grow older that year the danish anthropologist soren hansen drew the connection between the observations of bälz in japan and saabye in greenland this cannot be a coincidence it is not the first time that the resemblance between the japanese and the eskimo has been pointed out fridtjof nansen the norwegian polar explorer said that the spot was widespread in the mixed danisheskimo population of west greenland soren hansen confirmed this and further hypothesised that in both japan and greenland the spot might indicate an african connection a sign of direct descent from a black racial element see historical race concepts a missionary in bethel alaska a traditional gathering place of yupik people reported that the spots were common on children rudolf trebitsh an austrian linguist and ethnologist spent the summer of 1906 on the west coast of greenland and listed all the examples he came across gessain went to north labrador in 1926 looking for children with these spots in 1953 dr saxtorph medical advisor to the greenland department part of the danish government wrote that the greenlanders do not like outsiders to see or discuss these birthmarks they doubtless feel as a reminiscence of the time when they lived on a low cultural level   the presence or absence of the mongolian spot was used by racial theorists such as joseph deniker 18521918 the french anthropologist  the journal of cutaneous diseases including syphilis volume 23 contained several accounts of the mongolian spot on children in the americas a marriage between a chinese man and a white mexican woman was recorded in current anthropological literature volumes 12 published in 1912 titled note on two children born to a chinese and a mexican white note sur deux enfants nes dun chinois et d une mexicaine de race blanche ibid 122125 portr treats briefly of chen tean of hong kong his wife inez mancha a white mexican married in 1907 and their children a boy born april 14 1908 and a girl born september 24 1909 the boy is of marked chinese type the girl much more european no mongolian spots were noticed at birth both children were born with red cheeks neither has ever been sick the boy began to walk at ten months the girl a little after a year       the mongolian spot is referred to in the japanese idiom shiri ga aoi \u5c3b\u304c\u9752\u3044 meaning to have a blue butt   which is a reference to immaturity or inexperience in mexico where its name is the green butt spanish rabo verde it is referred to as la patada de cuauhtémoc meaning cuauhtémocs kick korean mythology explains

V congenital hypothyroidism ch or cretinism is a condition of thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function while even more have mild or partial degrees if untreated for several months after birth severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone thyroxine by mouth because the treatment is simple effective and inexpensive nearly all of the developed world practices newborn screening to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life   infants born with congenital hypothyroidism may show no effects or may display mild effects that often go unrecognized as a problem excessive sleeping reduced interest in nursing poor muscle tone low or hoarse cry infrequent bowel movements exaggerated jaundice and low body temperature if fetal deficiency was severe because of complete absence athyreosis of the gland physical features may include a larger anterior fontanel persistence of a posterior fontanel an umbilical hernia and a large tongue macroglossia in the era before newborn screening less than half of cases of severe hypothyroidism were recognized in the first month of life as the months proceeded these infants would grow poorly and be delayed in their development by several years of age they would display the recognizable facial and body features of cretinism persistence of severe untreated hypothyroidism resulted in severe mental impairment with an iq below 80 in the majority most of these children eventually ended up in institutional care 3 month old infant with untreated ch picture demonstrates hypotonic posture myxedematous facies macroglossia and umbilical hernia close up of face showing myxedematous facies macroglossia and skin mottling close up showing abdominal distension and umbilical hernia around the world the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency but in most of the developed world and areas of adequate environmental iodine cases are due to a combination of known and unknown causes most commonly there is a defect of development of the thyroid gland itself resulting in an absent athyreosis or underdeveloped hypoplastic gland a hypoplastic gland may develop higher in the neck or even in the back of the tongue a gland in the wrong place is referred to as ectopic and an ectopic gland at the base or back of the tongue is a lingual thyroid some of these cases of developmentally abnormal glands result from genetic defects and some are sporadic with no identifiable cause one japanese study found a statistical correlation between certain organochlorine insecticides and dioxinlike chemicals in the milk of mothers who had given birth to infants with congenital hypothyroidism  in some instances hypothyroidism detected by screening may be transient one common cause of this is the presence of maternal antibodies that temporarily impair thyroid function for several weeks  cretinism is an old term for the state of mental and physical retardation resulting from untreated congenital hypothyroidism usually due to iodine deficiency from birth because of low iodine levels in the soil and local food sources the term like so many other 19th century medical terms acquired pejorative connotations as it became used in lay speech it is now rarely used by physicians congenital hypothyroidism can also occur due to genetic defects of thyroxine or triiodothyronine synthesis within a structurally normal gland among specific defects are thyrotropin tsh resistance iodine trapping defect organification defect thyroglobulin and iodotyrosine deiodinase deficiency in a small proportion of cases of congenital hypothyroidism the defect is due to a deficiency of thyroid stimulating hormone either isolated or as part of congenital hypopituitarism genetic types of nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism include nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism has been described as the most prevalent inborn endocrine disorder  in the developed world nearly all cases of congenital hypothyroidism are detected by the newborn screening program these are based on measurement of tsh or thyroxine t4 on the second or third day of life heel prick if the tsh is high or the t4 low the infants doctor and parents are called and a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment often a technetium tc99m pertechnetate thyroid scan is performed to detect a structurally abnormal gland a radioactive iodine raiu exam will help differentiate congenital absence or a defect in organification a process necessary to make thyroid hormone the goal of newborn screening programs is to detect and start treatment within the first 12 weeks of life treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroxine available as a small tablet the generic name is levothyroxine and several brands are available commonly used brands in north america are synthroid levoxyl unithroid and levothroid the tablet is crushed and given to the infant with a small amount of water or milk the most commonly recommended dose range is 1015 \u03bcgkg daily typically 375 or 44 \u03bcg  within a few weeks the t4 and tsh levels are rechecked to confirm that they are being normalized by treatment as the child grows up these levels are checked regularly to maintain the right dose the dose increases as the child grows most children born with congenital hypothyroidism and correctly treated with thyroxine grow and develop normally in all respects even most of those with athyreosis and undetectable t4 levels at birth develop with normal intelligence although as a population academic performance tends to be below that of siblings and mild learning problems occur in some  congenital hypothyroidism is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability few treatments in the practice of medicine provide as large a benefit for as small an effort the developmental quotient dq as per gesell developmental schedules of children with hypothyroidism at age 24 months that have received treatment within the first 3 weeks of birth is summarised below   neonatal thyroid screening programs from all over the world have revealed that congenital hypothyroidism ch occurs with an incidence of 13000 to 14000     the differences in chincidence are more likely due to iodine deficiency thyroid disorders or to the type of screening method than to ethnic affiliation  ch is caused by an absent or defective thyroid gland classified into agenesis 2242 ectopy 3542 and gland in place defects 2436   it is also found to be of increased association with

V ochoa syndrome also called urofacial syndrome or hydronephrosis with peculiar facial expression  is an autosomal recessive  congenital disorder characterized by inverted facial expressions in association with obstructive disease of the urinary tract the inverted facial expression presented by children with this syndrome allows for early detection of the syndrome this inverted smile is easy to see when the child is smiling and laughing early detection is vital for establishing a better prognosis as urinary related problems associated with this disease can cause harm if left untreated incontinence is another easily detectable symptom of the syndrome that is due to detrusorsphincter discoordination although it can easily be mistaken for pyelonephritis it may be associated with hpse2    infants with the disorder exhibit an inverted smile they appear to be crying when they are actually smiling in conjunction with uropathy they also may be affected by hydronephrosis symptoms of this disease can start at very young ages many people with this syndrome will die in their teens to early 20s because of the renal failure uropathy if not diagnosed and treated children with the syndrome have abnormal facial development that cause an inverted smile nerve connections are however normal when attempting to smile the child will appear to cry urinary problems arise as a result of a neurogenic bladder most patients older than the age of toilet training present with enuresis urinarytract infection hydronephrosis and a spectrum of radiological abnormalities typical of obstructive or neurogenic bladders radiological abnormalities include things such as trabeculated bladder vesicoureteral reflex external sphincter spasm pyelonephritis hyperreflexic bladder noninhibited detrusor contraction etc urinary abnormalities might result in renal deterioration and failure this can be prevented by taking proper measures to restore normal micturition and by taking antibiotics to prevent infections in some cases the affected patients become hypertensive and progress to endstage renal disease while others become uremic additionally most patients suffer from constipation  early detection of this syndrome is possible through the peculiar faces that children present urofacial syndrome occurs due to either disruption or mutation of a gene on chromosome 10q23q24  the gene is located on a 1 centimorgan interval between d10s1433 and d10s603  alteration of this gene leads to alteration of facial and urinary developmental fields this gene is believed to be the hpse2 gene the hpse2 gene is expressed in both the central nervous system as well as the bladder heparanase 2 is protein coded by exons 8 and 9 on the hpse2 gene this protein is believed to be altered in the case of this syndrome  studies performed on mice indicate that hpse2 has no enzymatic activity  mutations in the hpse2 gene on chromosome 10q23q24 have been observed to cause ochoa syndrome this means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome chromosome 10 is an autosome and two copies of the defective gene one inherited from each parent are required in order to be born with the disorder the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder the relationship between a defective hpse2 gene and ochoa syndrome is unclear there is postulation that the genetic changes may lead to an abnormality in the brain region evidence for this postulation is that the areas of the brain that control facial expression and urination are in close proximity of each other other hypotheses think that the defective heparanase 2 protein may lead to problems with development of the urinary tract or with muscle function in the face and bladder  treatment can include amoxicillinclavulanic acid intravenous fluid administration and paracetamol oral for pain relief  other treatment varies based on the condition and extent of uropathy urofacial ochoa syndrome received the ochoa name because of the first person to describe it back in 1987 bernardo ochoa

V endosulfan is an offpatent organochlorine insecticide and acaricide that is being phased out globally the two isomers endo and exo are known popularly as i and ii endosulfan sulfate is a product of oxidation containing one extra o atom attached to the s atom endosulfan became a highly controversial agrichemical  due to its acute toxicity potential for bioaccumulation and role as an endocrine disruptor because of its threats to human health and the environment a global ban on the manufacture and use of endosulfan was negotiated under the stockholm convention in april 2011 the ban will take effect in mid2012 with certain uses exempted for five additional years  more than 80 countries  including the european union australia new zealand several west african nations  the united states   brazil  and canada  had already banned it or announced phaseouts by the time the stockholm convention ban was agreed upon it is still used extensively in india china and few other countries it is produced by makhteshim agan and several manufacturers in india and china   endosulfan has been used in agriculture around the world to control insect pests including whiteflies aphids leafhoppers colorado potato beetles and cabbage worms  due to its unique mode of action it is useful in resistance management however as it is not specific it can negatively impact populations of beneficial insects  it is however considered to be moderately toxic to honey bees  and it is less toxic to bees than organophosphate insecticides  the world health organization estimated worldwide annual production to be about 9000 metric tonnes t in the early 1980s  from 1980 to 1989 worldwide consumption averaged 10500 tonnes per year and for the 1990s use increased to 12800 tonnes per year endosulfan is a derivative of hexachlorocyclopentadiene and is chemically similar to aldrin chlordane and heptachlor specifically it is produced by the dielsalder reaction of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with cisbutene14diol and subsequent reaction of the adduct with thionyl chloride technical endosulfan is a 73 mixture of stereoisomers designated \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u03b1 and \u03b2endosulfan are configurational isomers arising from the pyramidal stereochemistry of the teravalent sulfur \u03b1endosulfan is the more thermodynamically stable of the two thus \u03b2endosulfan irreversibly converts to the \u03b1 form although the conversion is slow   endosulfan is one of the most toxic pesticides on the market today responsible for many fatal pesticide poisoning incidents around the world  endosulfan is also a xenoestrogena synthetic substance that imitates or enhances the effect of estrogensand it can act as an endocrine disruptor causing reproductive and developmental damage in both animals and humans  it has also been found to act as an aromatase inhibitor  whether endosulfan can cause cancer is debated with regard to consumers intake of endosulfan from residues on food the food and agriculture organization of united nations has concluded that longterm exposure from food is unlikely to present a public health concern but shortterm exposure can exceed acute reference doses  endosulfan is acutely neurotoxic to both insects and mammals including humans the us epa classifies it as category i highly acutely toxic based on a ld50 value of 30mgkg for female rats  while the world health organization classifies it as class ii moderately hazardous based on a rat ld50 of 80mgkg  it is a gabagated chloride channel antagonist and a ca  mg  atpase inhibitor both of these enzymes are involved in the transfer of nerve impulses symptoms of acute poisoning include hyperactivity tremors convulsions lack of coordination staggering difficulty breathing nausea and vomiting diarrhea and in severe cases unconsciousness  doses as low as 35mgkg have been documented to cause death in humans  and many cases of sublethal poisoning have resulted in permanent brain damage  farm workers with chronic endosulfan exposure are at risk of rashes and skin irritation  epas acute reference dose for dietary exposure to endosulfan is 0015mgkg for adults and 00015mgkg for children for chronic dietary expsoure the epa references doses are 0006mgkgday and 00006mgkgday for adults and children respectively  theo colborn an expert on endocrine disruption lists endosulfan as a known endocrine disruptor  and both the epa and the agency for toxic substances and disease registry consider endosulfan to be a potential endocrine disruptor numerous in vitro studies have documented its potential to disrupt hormones and animal studies have demonstrated its reproductive and developmental toxicity especially among males   a number of studies have documented that it acts as an antiandrogen in animals   endosulfan has shown to affect crustacean molt cycles which are important biological and endocrinecontrolled physiological processes essential for the crustacean growth and reproduction  environmentally relevant doses of endosulfan equal to the epas safe dose of 0006mgkgday have been found to affect gene expression in female rats similarly to the effects of estrogen  it is not known whether endosulfan is a human teratogen an agent that causes birth defects though it has significant teratogenic effects in laboratory rats  a 2009 assessment concluded the endocrine disruption in rats occurs only at endosulfan doses that cause neurotoxicity  several studies have documented that endosulfan can also affect human development researchers studying children from many villages in kasargod district kerala india have linked endosulfan exposure to delays in sexual maturity among boys endosulfan was the only pesticide applied to cashew plantations in the villages for 20 years and had contaminated the village environment the researchers compared the villagers to a control group of boys from a demographically similar village that lacked a history of endosulfan pollution relative to the control group the exposed boys had high levels of endosulfan in their bodies lower levels of testosterone and delays in reaching sexual maturity birth defects of the male reproductive system including cryptorchidism were also more prevalent in the study group the researchers concluded our study results suggest that endosulfan exposure in male children may delay sexual maturity and interfere with sex hormone synthesis  increased incidences of cryptorchidism have been observed in other studies of endosulfan exposed populations  a 2007 study by the california department of public health found that women who lived near farm fields sprayed with endosulfan and the related organochloride pesticide dicofol during the first eight weeks of pregnancy are several times more likely to give birth to children with autism this is the first study to look for an association between endosulfan and autism and additional study is needed to confirm the connection  a 2009 assessment concluded that epidemiology and rodent studies that suggest male reproductive and autism effects are open to other interpretations and that developmental or reproductive toxicity in rats occurs only at endosulfan doses that cause neurotoxicity  endosulfan is not listed as known probable or possible carcinogen by the epa iarc or other agencies no epidemiological studies link exposure to endosulfan specifically to cancer in humans but in vitro assays have shown that endosulfan can promote proliferation of human breast cancer cells  evidence of carcinogenicity in animals is mixed  endosulfan is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant the chemical is semivolatile and persistent to degradation processes in the environment endosulfan is subject to longrange atmospheric transport ie it can travel long distances from where it is used thus it occurs in many environmental compartments for example a 2008 report by the national park service found that endosulfan commonly contaminates air water plants and fish of national parks in the us most of these parks are far from areas where endosulfan is used  endosulfan has been found in remote locations such as the arctic ocean as well as in the antarctic atmosphere  the pesticide has also been detected in dust from the sahara desert collected in the caribbean after being blown across the atlantic ocean  the compound has been shown to be one of the most abundant organochlorine pesticides in the global atmosphere  the compound breaks down into endosulfan sulfate endosulfan diol and endosulfan furan all of which have structures similar to the parent compound and according to the epa are also of toxicological concernthe estimated halflives for the combined toxic residues endosulfan plus endosulfan sulfate range from roughly 9 months to 6 years the epa concluded based on environmental fate laboratory studies terrestrial field dissipation studies available models monitoring studies and published literature it can be concluded that endosulfan is a very persistent chemical which may stay in the environment for lengthy periods of time particularly in acid media the epa also concluded endosulfan has relatively high potential to bioaccumulate in fish  it is also toxic to amphibians low levels have been found to kill tadpoles  in 2009 the committee of scientific experts of the stockholm convention concluded endosulfan is likely as a result of long range environmental transport to lead to significant adverse human health and environmental effects such that global action is warranted  in may 2011 the stockholm convention committee approved the recommendation for elimination of production and use of endosulfan and its isomers worldwide this is however subject to certain exemptions overall this will lead to its elimination from the global markets  although classified as a yellow label highly toxic pesticide by the central insecticides board india is one of the largest producers  and the largest consumer of endosulfan in the world  of the total volume manufactured in india three companies  excel crop care hindustan insecticides ltd and coromandal fertilizers  produce 4500 tonnes annually for domestic use and another 4000 tonnes for export endosulfan is widely used in most of the plantation crops in india the toxicity of endosulfan and health issues due to its bioaccumulation came under media attention when health issues precipitated in the kasargod district of kerala were publicised   this inspired protests and the pesticide was banned in kerala as early as 2001 following a report by the national institute of occupational health in the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants of 2011 when an international consensus arose for the global ban of the pesticide india opposed this move due to pressure from the endosulfan manufacturing companies   this flared up the protest    and while india still maintained its stance the global conference decided on a global ban for which india asked a remission for 10 years later on a petition filed in the supreme court of india the production storage sale and use of the pesticide was temporarily banned on 13 may 2011 and later permanently by the end of 2011 the karnataka government also banned the use of endosulfan with immediate effect briefing presspersons after the state cabinet meeting minister for higher education vs acharya said the cabinet discussed the harmful effects of endosulfan on the health of farmers and people living in rural areas the government will now invoke the provisions of the insecticides act 1968 a central act and write a letter to the union government about the ban minister for energy and food and civil supplies shobha karandlaje who has been spearheading a movement seeking a ban on endosulfan said i am grateful to chief minister bs yeddyurappa and members of the cabinet for approving the ban  rajendra singh rana has written a letter to prime minister manmohan singh demanding the withdrawal of the national institute of occupational health nioh study on endosulfan titled report of the investigation of unusual illness allegedly produced by the endosulfan exposure in padre village of kasargod district in north kerala in his statement mr rana said the nioh report is flawed im in complete agreement with what the workers have to say on this in fact i have already made representation to the prime minister and concerned union ministers of health and environment demanding immediate withdrawal of the report as reported by the economic times and outlook india    mrs vibhavari dave local leader and member of legislative assembly mla from bhavnagar gujarat voiced her concerns on the impact of ban of endosulfan on families and workers of bhavnagar she was a part of the delegation with bhavnagar mp rajendra singh rana which submitted a memorandum to the district collectors office to withdraw the nioh report calling for ban of endosulfan   the pollution control board of the government of kerala prohibited the use of endosulfan in the state of kerala on 10 november 2010  on february 18 2011 the karnataka government followed suit and suspended the use of endosulfan for a period of 60 days in the state  indian union minister of agriculture sharad pawar has ruled out implementing a similar ban at the national level despite the fact that endosulfan has banned in 63 countries including the european union australia and new zealand  the government of gujarat had initiated a study in response to the workers rally in bhavnagar and representations made by sishuvihar an ngo based in ahmadabad the committee constituted for the study also included former deputy director of nioh ahmadabad the committee noted that the who fao iarc and us epa have indicated that endosulfan is not carcinogenic not teratogenic not mutagenic and not genotoxic the highlight of this report is the farmer exposure study based on analysis of their blood reports for residues of endosulfan and the absence of any residues this corroborates the lack of residues in workerexposure studies   the supreme court passed interim order on may 13 2011 in a writ petition filed by democratic youth federation of india dyfi a youth wing of communist party of india marxist in the backdrop of the incidents reported in kasargode kerala and banned the production distribution and use of endosulfan in india because the pesticide has debilitating effects on humans and the environment the centre for science and environment cse welcomed this order and called it a resounding defeat for the pesticide industry which has been promoting this deadly toxin a 2001 study by cse had established the linkages between the aerial spraying of the pesticide and the growing health disorders in kasaragodeover the years other studies have confirmed these findings and the health hazards associated with endosulfan are now widely known and accepted however in july 2012 the government asked the supreme court to allow use of the pesticide in all states except kerala and karnataka as these states are ready to use it for pest control  endosulfan was banned in new zealand by the environmental risk management authority effective january 2009  after a concerted campaign by environmental groups and the green party a shipment of about 10 tonnes of endosulfan was illegally stowed on the illfated mv princess of the stars a ferry that sank off the waters of romblon sibuyan island philippines during a storm in june 2008 search rescue and salvage efforts were suspended when the endosulfan shipment was discovered and blood samples from divers at the scene were sent to malaysia for analysis  the department of health of the philippines has temporarily banned the consumption of fish caught in the area  endosulfan is classified as a severe marine pollutant by the international maritime dangerous goods code  in the united states endosulfan is only registered for agricultural use and these uses are being phased out  it has been used extensively on cotton potatoes tomatoes and apples according to the epa  the epa estimates that 626 thousand kg of endosulfan were used annually from 1987 to 1997  the us exported more than 140000 lb of endosulfan from 2001 to 2003 mostly to latin america  but production and export has since stopped in california endosulfan contamination from the san joaquin valley has been implicated in the extirpation of the mountain yellowlegged frog from parts of the nearby sierra nevada  in florida levels of contamination the everglades and biscayne bay are high enough to pose a threat to some aquatic organisms    in 2007 the epa announced it was rereviewing the safety of endosulfan  the following year pesticide action network and nrdc petitioned the epa to ban endosulfan  and a coalition of environmental and labor groups sued the epa seeking to overturn its 2002 decision to not ban endosulfan  in june 2010 the epa announced it was negotiating a phaseout of all uses with the sole us manufacturer makhteshim agan and a complete ban on the compound  an official statement by makhteshim agan of north america mana states from a scientific standpoint mana continues to disagree fundamentally with epas conclusions regarding endosulfan and believes that key uses are still eligible for reregistration the statement adds however given the fact that the endosulfan market is quite small and the cost of developing and submitting additional data high we have decided to voluntarily negotiate an agreement with epa that provides growers with an adequate time frame to find alternatives for the damaging insect pests currently controlled by endosulfan    australia banned endosulfan on october 12 2010    with a twoyear phaseout for stock of endosulfancontaining products  australia had in 2008 announced endosulfan would not be banned  citing new zealands ban the australian greens called for zero tolerance of endosulfan residue on food  us apples with endosulfan are now allowed to be exported to taiwan although the roc government denied any us pressure on it  brazil decreed total ban of the substance from july 31 2013 being forbidden imports of the product from july 31 2011 date in which national production and utilization begins to be phased out gradually

familial mediterranean fever fmf in east block and libya morocco beta thalassemia in all countries g6dh deficiency all countries   most of the genetic markers of arabs genetic diseases are phenotypic ie specific mutations of arab peoples especially in countries even though genetic mutations of gulf states are mostly the same but some genetic phenotypes are kuwaiti etc the diseases have geographical distribution among arab countries such as greater syria gulf states yemen western block morocco algeria tunisia because of the restrictid marriages to each block or even to one country moreover cousin marriages conseigenityand endogamy marriages restricted to minority sects excaberate the problem distancing of marriages from distant gene pools might help resolve the problem in arabic countries many of the pronounced genetic deficiencies in arabs are located on hla segment on chromosome 6  this same segment mutations are markers of arabs in genealogical and forensic profiling tests and studies such studies as      arab population data on the pcrbased locihla   hla polymorphism in saudi  since over 70 of arab genetic disorders are autosomalrecessive meaning the defective gene has to be found in both father and mother and since the gene pool are similar in population males and females alike since autosomal chromosomes are admixture from father and mother in closed societies marriages from same sect endogamy or same tribe or even from same country or even from same block of countries since gene pool is similar in geographical blocks as shown in the online brocures referenced above  gulf states block diseases are similar including saudi arabia while yemen is a different block greater syria is different iraq is a different block while morocco and algeria and tunisia are one different block the west etc the cause of high incidence of genetic disorders is that the paternal ancestry is homogeneous across all arab countries while maternal ancestry is very diverse a good feature  but still is different among the aforementioned blocks the original historical maternal ancestral haplogroups of the near east were l3 and hv1 still high in yemen while in greater syria there is a european maternal gene flow in the arabic west the dominant maternal lineage is the rare scandinavian european u8 haplogroup probably came with the vandals when escaped from spain from the visigoths distancing marriages as far as possible will prevent most autosomal recessive disorders and other disorders by diluting and mixing the gene pool of the child the paternal ancestry across all arabic countries is haplogroup j1 especially the its major subclade j1p58 the haplogroup that spread with arabic conquest in the 7th century it was found that haplogroup j1 occur at high frequencies among the arabicspeaking populations of the middle east and is the prevalent ychromosome lineage within the near east haplogroup j1e jp58 is also associated with a semitic linguistic common denominator with the ycaii 2222 allele state is closely associated with j1e  jp58 subclade of j1 is single paternal lineage originated in the near east of high frequency in bedouins 70 yemenis 68 jordanians 55 55 of palestinian arabs 48 of omani people 34 of tunisians 35 of algerians and its precipitations drop in frequency as one moves away from saudi arabia and the near east jp58 include all the j1cmh haplotypes and is ycaii2222 motif both found in arabs and j1cohanim jews descendents of aaron   the motif ycaii2222 characterise a monophyletic clad found in arabs but less frequent in ethiopian j1 and rare in europe and caucasus    it is now been resolved that the arabic clade j1p58l1471 that include all j1cohanim jews and all cmh haplotypes and is ycaii2222 was the j1 clade that spread far and wide by the islamic conquest   both qahtanite and adnanite arabs are j1p58 haplogroup since the arabs of north africa like algeria known to have qahtanite lineage from the arab conquest and adnanite lineage from bani hilal and bani sulaim migration to north africa in the 10th century by the fatimides yet only e of the berber and j1 are found in arabs of north africa and this j1 is marked by cmh and the motif ycaii2222 the j2 in algerian arabs is minor 3 and is of the rare j2m67 of chechnea rarely found in other arabic countries and non existent in arabian peninsula

V structural variation also genomic structural variation is the variation in structure of an organisms chromosome it consists of many kinds of variation in the genome of one species and usually includes microscopic and submicroscopic types such as deletions duplications copynumber variants insertions inversions and translocations typically a structure variation affects a sequence length about 1kb to 3mb which is larger than snps and smaller than chromosome abnormality though the definitions have some overlapping  the definition of structural variation does not imply anything about frequency or phenotypical effects many structural variants are associated with genetic diseases however more are not  recent research about svs indicates that svs are more difficult to detect than snps snps always occur in two alleles while approximately 5 of the human genome are defined as structurally variant in the normal population involving more than 800 independent genes rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that structural variations can comprise millions of nucleotides of heterogeneity within every genome and are likely to make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility   microscopic means that it can be detected with optical microscopes such as aneuploidies marker chromosome gross rearrangements and variation in chromosome size   the frequency in human population is thought to be underestimated due to the fact that some of these are not actually easy to identify these structural abnormalities exist in 1 every 375 live births by putative information  copynumber variation cnv is a large category of structural variation which includes insertions deletions and duplications in recent studies copynumber variations are tested on people who do not have genetic diseases using methods that are used for quantitative snp genotyping results show that 28 of the suspected regions in the individuals actually do contain copy number variations   also cnvs in human genome affect more nucleotides than single nucleotide polymorphism snp it is also noteworthy that many of cnvs are not in coding regions because cnvs are usually caused by unequal recombination widespread similar sequences such as lines and sines may be a common mechanism of cnv creation   there are several inversions known which are related to human disease for instance recurrent 400kb inversion in factor viii gene is a common cause of haemophilia a  and smaller inversions affecting idunorate 2sulphatase ids will cause hunter syndrome  more examples include angelman syndrome and sotos syndrome however recent research shows that one person can have 56 putative inversions thus the nondisease inversions are more common than previously supposed also in this study its indicated that inversion breakpoints are commonly associated with segmental duplications  one 900 kb inversion in the chromosome 17 is under positive selection and are predicted to increase its frequency in european population  in addition to the most common kinds there are also cryptic translocations and segmental uniparental disomy upd among others there are increasing reports of these variations but are more difficult to detect than traditional variations because these variants are balanced and arraybased or pcrbased methods are not able to locate them  some genetic diseases are suspected to be caused by structural variations but the relation is not very certain it is not plausible to divide these variants into two classes as normal or disease because the actual output of the same variant will also vary also a few of the variants are actually positively selected for mentioned above in 2007 one study  new copynumber variations are identified to play some role in autism spectrum disorder and maybe other mental situations structural variations also have its function in population genetics different frequency of a same variation can be used as a genetic mark to infer relationship between populations in different areas a complete comparison between human and chimpanzee structural variation also suggested that some of these may be fixed in one species because of its adaptative function  there are also deletions related to resistance against malaria and aids   also some highly variable segments are thought to be caused by balancing selection but there are also studies against this hypothesis  some of genome browsers and bioinformatic databases have a list of structural variations in human genome with an emphasis on cnvs and can show them in the genome browsing page for example ucsc genome browser  under the page viewing a part of the genome there are common cell cnvs and structural var which can be enabled on ncbi there is a special page   for structural variation in that system both inner and outer coordinates are shown they are both not actual breakpoints but surmised minimal and maximum range of sequence affected by the structural variation the types are classified as insertion loss gain inversion loh everted transchr and upd  software using nextgeneration sequencing data to detect structural variations

V sacrococcygeal teratoma sct is a type of tumor known as a teratoma that develops at the base of the coccyx tailbone and is thought to be derived from the primitive streak  sacrococcygeal teratomas are benign 75 of the time malignant and lifethreatening 12 of the time and the remainder are considered immature teratomas that share benign and malignant features benign sacrococcygeal teratomas are more likely to develop in younger children who are less than 5 months old and older children are more likely to develop malignant sacrococcygeal teratomas   sct is seen in 1 in every 35000 live births and is the most common tumor presenting in newborn humans most scts are found in babies and children but scts have been reported in adults  and the increasingly routine use of prenatal ultrasound exams has dramatically increased the number of diagnosed scts presenting in fetuses like other teratomas an sct can grow very large unlike other teratomas an sct sometimes grows larger than the rest of the fetus sacrococcygeal teratomas are the most common type of germ cell tumors both benign and malignant diagnosed in neonates infants and children younger than 4 years  scts occur more often in girls than in boys ratios of 31 to 41 have been reported  historically sacrococcygeal teratomas present in 2 clinical patterns related to the childs age tumor location and likelihood of tumor malignancy with the advent of routine prenatal ultrasound examinations a third clinical pattern is emerging during prenatal ultrasound an sct having an external component may appear as a fluidfilled cyst or a solid mass sticking out from the fetus body fetal scts that are entirely internal may be undetected if they are small detection or at least suspicion is possible when the fetal bladder is seen in an abnormal position due to the sct pushing other organs out of place at birth the usual presentation is a visible lump or mass under the skin at the top of the buttocks crease if not visible it can sometimes be felt gently prodded it feels somewhat like a hardboiled egg a small sct if it is entirely inside the body may not present for years until it grows large enough to cause pain constipation and other symptoms of a large mass inside the pelvis or until it begins to extend out of the pelvis even a relatively large sct may be missed if it is internal because the bony pelvis conceals and protects it mediastinal tumors including teratomas are similarly concealed and protected by the rib cage some scts are discovered when a child begins to talk at about age 2 years and complains of their bottom hurting or feeling poopy when they ride in a car seat other tumors can occur in the sacrococcygeal andor presacral regions  and hence must be ruled out to obtain a differential diagnosis these include extraspinal ependymoma  ependymoblastoma  neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma smaller scts with an external component seen in prenatal ultrasounds or at birth often are mistaken for spina bifida  cystic sct and terminal myelocystocele are especially difficult to distinguish for more accurate diagnosis mri has been recommended  the preferred first treatment for sct is complete surgical removal ie complete resection the preferred approach to a small sct is through the perineum a large sct may require an additional approach through the abdomen resection should include the coccyx and may also include portions of the sacrum the surgery should include reattachment of the small muscles and ligaments formerly attached to the coccyx in effect reconstructing the posterior perineum if not there is an increased risk of perineal hernia later in life scts are classified morphologically according to their relative extent outside and inside the body the altman type is significant in the contexts of management of labor and delivery surgical approach and complications of sct serial ultrasound and mri monitoring of scts in fetuses in utero has demonstrated that the altman type can change over time as the tumor grows it can push between other organs and through the perineum to the body surface where the tumor appears as a bulge covered only by skin sometimes the tumor bulge later slips back inside the perineum like all teratomas a sacrococcygeal teratoma has the potential to be malignant and the standard of care requires longterm followup by an oncologist management of most fetal scts involves watchful waiting prior to any treatment an often used decision tree is as follows emergent problems include maternal mirror syndrome polyhydramnios and preterm labor poor management decisions including interventions that are either premature or delayed can have dire consequences   a very small retrospective study of 9 babies with scts greater than 10cm diameter reported slightly higher survivorship in babies remaining in utero slightly longer  in many cases a fetus with a small sct under 5 or 10cm may be delivered vaginally     prior to the advent of prenatal detection and hence scheduled csection 90 of babies diagnosed with sct were born full term  scts are very rare in adults and as a rule these tumors are benign and have extremely low potential for malignancy this estimation of potential is based on the idea that because the tumor existed for decades prior to diagnosis without becoming malignant it has little or no potential to ever become malignant for this reason and because coccygectomy in adults has greater risks than in babies some surgeons prefer not to remove the coccyx of adult survivors of sct there are case reports of good outcomes  maternal complications of pregnancy may include mirror syndrome  maternal complications of delivery may include a cesarean section or alternatively a vaginal delivery with mechanical dystocia  complications of the mass effect of a teratoma in general are addressed on the teratoma page complications of the mass effect of a large sct may include hip dysplasia bowel obstruction urinary obstruction hydronephrosis and hydrops fetalis even a small sct can produce complications of mass effect if it is presacral altman type iv  in the fetus severe hydronephrosis may contribute to inadequate lung development also in the fetus and newborn the anus may be imperforate later complications of the mass effect andor surgery may include neurogenic bladder other forms of urinary incontinence fecal incontinence and other chronic problems resulting from accidental damage to or sacrifice of nerves and muscles within the pelvis  removal of the coccyx may include additional complications in one review of 25 patients  however the most frequent complication was an unsatisfactory appearance of the surgical scar late effects are of two kinds consequences of the tumor itself and consequences of surgery and other treatments for the tumor complications of not removing the coccyx may include both recurrence of the teratoma  and metastatic cancer   late malignancies usually involve incomplete excision of the coccyx and are adenocarcinoma although functional disability in survivors is common  a small comparative study  found a nonsignificant difference between sct survivors and a matched control group in rare cases pelvic scarring may necessitate that a pregnant woman who is a sct survivor deliver her baby by cesarean section

V minor physical anomalies mpas are relatively minor typically painless and in themselves harmless congenital physical abnormalities consisting of features such as lowset ears single transverse palmar crease telecanthus micrognathism macrocephaly hypotonia and furrowed tongue  while mpas may have a genetic basis they might also be caused by factors in the fetal environment anoxia bleeding or infection  mpas have been linked to disorders of pregnancy  and are thought by some to be a marker for insults to the fetal neural development towards the end of the first trimester  thus in the neurodevelopmental literature they are seen as indirect indications of inferferences with brain development  in studies of children and adolescents with conduct problems such markers have been linked to some extent to impulsivity and aggressiveness  mpas have been studied in autism down syndrome and in schizophrenia a 2008 metaanalysis found that mpas are significantly increased in the autistic population  a 1998 study found that 60 of its schizophrenic sample and 38 of their siblings had 6 or more mpas especially in the craniofacial area while only 5 of the control group showed that many  some mpas related to schizophrenia have a hypoxic contribution to their formation  these anomalies are thought to reflect changes in the brain as both are derived  from the ectoderm  several mpas are attributable in part to hypoxia  the most often cited mpa high arched palate is described in articles as a microform of a cleft palate  cleft palates are partly attributable to hypoxia  the vaulted palate caused by nasal obstruction and consequent mouth breathing without the lateralising effect of the tongue can produce hypoxia at night  other mpas are reported only sporadically capillary malformation is induced by rasa1 mutation and can be changed by hypoxia  a study in the american journal of psychiatry by trixler et al   found hemangiomas to be highly significant in schizophrenia exotropia is reported as having low correlation and high significance as well  it can be caused by perinatal hypoxia

V valproate vpa also known valproic acid sodium valproate and divalproex sodium is a medication primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and to prevent migraine headaches  it is useful for the prevention of seizures in those with absence seizures partial seizures and generalized seizures it can be given intravenously or by mouth long acting formulations exist  common side effects include nausea vomiting sleepiness and a dry mouth serious side effects can include liver problems and regular monitoring of liver function tests is therefore recommended other serious risks include pancreatitis and an increased suicide risk it is known to cause serious abnormalities in the baby if taken during pregnancy because of this it is not typically recommended in women of childbearing age who have migraines it is unclear how valproate works  valproate was first made in 1881 and come into medical use in 1962  it is on the world health organizations list of essential medicines the most important medications needed in a basic health system  it is available as a generic medication  the wholesale cost is between 014 and 052 usd per day  in the united states it costs about 090 usd per day it is marketed under the brand name depakote among others  its primary use to treatment epilepsy and bipolar disorder it is also used to prevent migraine headaches  valproate has a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity although it is primarily used as a firstline treatment for tonicclonic seizures absence seizures and myoclonic seizures and as a secondline treatment for partial seizures and infantile spasms   it has also been successfully given intravenously to treat status epilepticus    valproate products are also used to treat manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder  offlabel uses include impulse control disorders suggested by recent evidence of efficacy in controlling this adverse effect of parkinsons disease medical therapy  valproate is also used to prevent migraine headaches because this medication can be potentially harmful to the fetus valproate should be considered for women of childbearing potential only after the risk have been discussed  the medication has been tested in the treatment of aids and cancer owing to its histone deacetylaseinhibiting effects  most common adverse effects include  serious adverse effects include  valproic acid has a black box warning for hepatotoxicity pancreatitis and fetal abnormalities  there is evidence that valproic acid may cause premature growth plate ossification in children and adolescents resulting in decreased height     valproic acid can also cause mydriasis a dilation of the pupils  there is evidence that shows valproic acid may increase the chance of polycystic ovary syndrome pcos in women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder however studies have shown this risk of pcos is higher in women with epilepsy compared to those with bipolar disorder  valproate causes birth defects exposure during pregnancy is associated with about three times as many major abnormalities as usual mainly spina bifida with the risks being related to the strength of medication used and use of more than one drug   more rarely with several other defects possibly including a valproate syndrome  characteristics of this valproate syndrome include facial features that tend to evolve with age including a triangleshaped forehead tall forehead with bifrontal narrowing epicanthic folds medial deficiency of eyebrows flat nasal bridge broad nasal root anteverted nares shallow philtrum long upper lip and thin vermillion borders thick lower lip and small downturned mouth  while developmental delay is usually associated with altered physical characteristics dysmorphic features this is not always the case  children of mothers taking valproate during pregnancy are at risk for lower iqs    maternal valproate use during pregnancy has been associated with a significantly higher probability of autism in the offspring  a 2005 study found rates of autism among children exposed to sodium valproate before birth in the cohort studied were 89  the normal incidence for autism in the general population is estimated at less than one percent  a 2009 study found that the 3yearold children of pregnant women taking valproate had an iq nine points lower than that of a wellmatched control group however further research in older children and adults is needed    sodium valproate has been associated with the rare condition paroxysmal tonic upgaze of childhood also known as ouvrierbillson syndrome from childhood or fetal exposure this condition resolved after discontinuing valproate therapy   women who intend to become pregnant should switch to a different medication if possible or decrease their dose of valproate  women who become pregnant while taking valproate should be warned that it causes birth defects and cognitive impairment in the newborn especially at high doses although valproate is sometimes the only drug that can control seizures and seizures in pregnancy could have even worse consequences studies have shown that taking folic acid can reduce the risk of congenital neural tube defects  valproate in elderly people with dementia caused increased sleepiness more people stopped the medication for this reason additional side effects of weight loss and decreased food intake was also associated in onehalf of people who become sleepy  contraindications include  valproate inhibits cyp2c9 glucuronyl transferase and epoxide hydrolase and is highly protein bound and hence may interact with drugs that are substrates for any of these enzymes or are highly protein bound themselves  it may also potentiate the cns depressant effects of alcohol  it should not be given in conjunction with other antiepileptics due to the potential for reduced clearance of other antiepileptics including carbamazepine lamotrigine phenytoin and phenobarbitone and itself  it may also interact with    excessive amounts of valproic acid can result in sleepiness tremor stupor respiratory depression coma metabolic acidosis and death in general serum or plasma valproic acid concentrations are in a range of 20100mgl during controlled therapy but may reach 1501500mgl following acute poisoning monitoring of the serum level is often accomplished using commercial immunoassay techniques although some laboratories employ gas or liquid chromatography  in contrast to other antiepileptic drugs at present there is little favorable evidence for salivary therapeutic drug monitoring salivary levels of valproic acid correlate poorly with serum levels partly due to valproates weak acid property pka of 49  in severe intoxication hemoperfusion or hemofiltration can be an effective means of hastening elimination of the drug from the body   supportive therapy should be given to all patients experiencing an overdose and urine output should be monitored  supplemental lcarnitine is indicated in patients having an acute overdose   and also prophylactically  in high risk patients acetyllcarnitine lowers hyperammonemia less markedly  than lcarnitine although the mechanism of action of valproate is not fully understood  it has recently been shown to protect against a seizureinduced reduction in phosphatidylinositol 345trisphosphate pip3 as a potential therapeutic mechanism  in addition its anticonvulsant effect has been attributed to the blockade of voltagedependent sodium channels and increased brain levels of gammaaminobutyric acid gaba  the gabaergic effect is also believed to contribute towards the antimanic properties of valproate  in animals sodium valproate raises cerebral and cerebellar levels of the inhibitory synaptic neurotransmitter gaba possibly by inhibiting gaba degradative enzymes such as gaba transaminase succinatesemialdehyde dehydrogenase and by inhibiting the reuptake of gaba by neuronal cells  it also possesses histone deacetylaseinhibiting effects the inhibition of histone deacetylase by promoting more transcriptionally active chromatin structures likely presents the epigenetic mechanism for regulation of many of the neuroprotective effects attributed to valproic acid intermediate molecules mediating these effects include vegf bdnf and gdnf   valproic acid has been found to be an antagonist of the androgen and progesterone receptors and hence a nonsteroidal antiandrogen and antiprogestogen at concentrations much lower than therapeutic serum levels  it was concluded that these actions are likely to be involved in the reproductive endocrine disturbances seen with valproic acid treatment  valproic acid was first synthesized in 1882 by beverly s burton as an analogue of valeric acid found naturally in valerian  valproic acid is a carboxylic acid a clear liquid at room temperature for many decades its only use was in laboratories as a metabolically inert solvent for organic compounds in 1962 the french researcher pierre eymard serendipitously discovered the anticonvulsant properties of valproic acid while using it as a vehicle for a number of other compounds that were being screened for antiseizure activity he found it prevented pentylenetetrazolinduced convulsions in laboratory rats  it was approved as an antiepileptic drug in 1967 in france and has become the most widely prescribed antiepileptic drug worldwide  valproic acid has also been used for migraine prophylaxis and bipolar disorder  valproate exists in two main molecular variants sodium valproate and valproic acid without sodium often implied by simply valproate a mixture between these two is termed semisodium valproate it is unclear whether there is any difference in efficacy between these variants except from the fact that about 10 more of sodium vaproate is needed than valproic acid without sodium to compensate for the sodium itself  branded products include all the above formulations are pharmacsubsidised  in much of europe depakine and depakine chrono tablets are equivalent to epilim and epilim chrono above depalept and depalept chrono extended release tablets are equivalent to epilim and epilim chrono above manufactured and distributed by sanofiaventis

V pendred syndrome or pendred disease is a genetic disorder leading to congenital bilateral both sides sensorineural hearing loss and goitre with euthyroid or mild hypothyroidism decreased thyroid gland function there is no specific treatment other than supportive measures for the hearing loss and thyroid hormone supplementation in case of hypothyroidism it is named after dr vaughan pendred 18691946 the english doctor who first described the condition in an irish family living in durham in 1896   it accounts for 75 of all cases of congenital deafness    the hearing loss of pendreds syndrome is often although not always present from birth and language acquisition may be a significant problem if deafness is severe in childhood the hearing loss typically worsens over the years and progression can be stepwise and related to minor head trauma in some cases language development worsens after head injury demonstrating that the inner ear is sensitive to trauma in pendred syndrome this is as a consequence of the widened vestibular aqueducts usual in this syndrome  vestibular function varies in pendred syndrome and vertigo can be a feature of minor head trauma a goitre is present in 75 of all cases  audiometry measuring ability to hear sounds of a particular pitch is usually abnormal but the findings are not particularly specific and an audiogram is not sufficient to diagnose pendreds syndrome a thyroid goitre may be present in the first decade and is usual towards the end of the second decade mri scanning of the inner ear usually shows widened or large vestibular aqueducts with enlarged endolymphatic sacs and may show abnormalities of the cochleae that is known as mondini dysplasia  genetic testing to identify the pendrin gene usually establishes the diagnosis if the condition is suspected a perchlorate discharge test is sometimes performed this test is highly sensitive but may also be abnormal in other thyroid conditions  if a goitre is present thyroid function tests are performed to identify mild cases of thyroid dysfunction even if they are not yet causing symptoms  pendred syndrome inherits in an autosomal recessive manner meaning that one would need to inherit an abnormal gene from each parent to develop the condition this also means that a sibling of a patient with pendreds syndrome has a 25 chance of also having the condition if the parents are unaffected carriers it has been linked to mutations in the pds gene which codes for the pendrin protein solute carrier family 26 member 4 slc26a4 the gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 7q31   mutations in the same gene also cause enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome eva or evas another congenital cause of deafness specific mutations are more likely to cause evas while others are more linked with pendred syndrome  slc26a4 can be found in the cochlea part of the inner ear thyroid and the kidney in the kidney it participates in the secretion of bicarbonate however pendreds syndrome is not known to lead to kidney problems  it functions as an iodidechloride transporter  in the thyroid this leads to reduced organification of iodine ie its incorporation into thyroid hormone  no specific treatment exists for pendred syndrome speech and language support and cochlear implants may improve language skills  if thyroid hormone levels are decreased thyroid hormone supplements may be required patients are advised to take precautions against head injury

V a syrinx is a rare fluidfilled neuroglial cavity within the spinal cord syringomyelia in the brain stem syringobulbia or in the nerves of the elbow usually in a young age   syrinx is taken directly from the ancient greek word for tube it is the root of the word syringe  a syrinx results when a watery protective substance known as cerebrospinal fluid that normally flows around the spinal cord and brain transporting nutrients and waste products collects in a small area of the spinal cord and forms a pseudocyst a number of medical conditions can cause an obstruction in the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid redirecting it into the spinal cord itself for reasons that are only now becoming clear this results in syrinx formation cerebrospinal fluid fills the syrinx pressure differences along the spine cause the fluid to move within the cyst physicians believe that it is this continual movement of fluid that results in cyst growth and further damage to the spinal cord in the case of syringomyelia the syrinx can expand and elongate over time destroying the spinal cord since the spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in the extremities this damage may result in pain weakness and stiffness in the back shoulders arms or legs other symptoms may include headaches and a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold especially in the hands each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms these symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and often more critically to the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord as a syrinx is not a medical condition in and of itself merely the outcome of one causes and treatments are not listed here syrinxes usually result from lesions that partially obstruct csf flow at least ½ of syrinxes occur in patients with congenital abnormalities of the craniocervical junction eg herniation of cerebellar tissue into the spinal canal called chiari malformation brain eg encephalocele or spinal cord eg myelomeningocelesee congenital neurologic anomalies brain anomalies for unknown reasons these congenital abnormalities often expand during the teen or young adult years a syrinx can also develop in patients who have a spinal cord tumor scarring due to previous spinal trauma or no known predisposing factors about 30 of people with a spinal cord tumor eventually develop a syrinx syringomyelia is a paramedian usually irregular longitudinal cavity it commonly begins in the cervical area but may extend downward along the entire length of the spinal cord  syringobulbia which is rare usually occurs as a slitlike gap within the lower brain stem and may disrupt or compress the lower cranial nerves or ascending sensory or descending motor pathways symptoms usually begin insidiously between adolescence and age 45 syringomyelia develops in the center of the spinal cord causing a central cord syndrome pain and temperature sensory deficits occur early but may not be recognized for years the first abnormality recognized may be a painless burn or cut syringomyelia typically causes weakness atrophy and often fasciculations and hyporeflexia of the hands and arms a deficit in pain and temperature sensation in a capelike distribution over the shoulders arms and back is characteristic light touch and position and vibration sensation are not affected later spastic leg weakness develops deficits may be asymmetric syringobulbia may cause vertigo nystagmus unilateral or bilateral loss of facial sensation lingual atrophy and weakness dysarthria dysphagia hoarseness and sometimes peripheral sensory or motor deficits due to medullary compression a syrinx is suggested by an unexplained central cord syndrome or other characteristic neurologic deficits particularly pain and temperature sensory deficits in a capelike distribution mri of the entire spinal cord and brain is done administration of intravenous gadolinium during the mri examination is useful for detecting any associated tumor underlying problems eg craniocervical junction abnormalities postoperative scarring spinal tumors are corrected when possible surgical decompression of the foramen magnum and upper cervical cord is the only useful treatment but surgery usually cannot reverse severe neurologic deterioration

V van der woude syndrome vdws is a genetic disorder characterized by the combination of lower lip pits cleft lip with or without cleft palate and cleft palate alone cp the frequency of orofacial clefts ranges from 11000 to 1500 births worldwide and there are more than 400 syndromes that involve cleft lip with or without cleft palate  vws is distinct from other clefting syndromes due to the combination of cleft lip and palate clp and cp within the same family other features frequently associated with vws include hypodontia in 1081 of cases narrow arched palate congenital heart disease heart murmur and cerebral abnormalities syndactyly of the hands polythelia ankyloglossia and adhesions between the upper and lower gum pads  the association between lower lip pits and cleft lip andor palate was first described by anne van der woude in 1954 the worldwide disease incidence ranges from 1100000 to 140000    van der woude syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in a single gene with equal distribution between the sexes the disease has high penetrance at about 96 but the phenotypic expression varies from lower lip pits with cleft lip and cleft palate to no visible abnormalities   approximately 88 of vws patients display lower lip pits and in about 64 of cases lip pits are the only visible defect reported clefting covers a wide range including submucous cleft palate incomplete unilateral cl bifid uvula and complete bilateral clp vws is the most common orofacial clefting syndrome accounting for 2 of clp cases  the majority of vws cases are caused by haploinsufficiency due to mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 gene irf6 on chromosome 1 in the 1p32p41 region known as vws locus 1 a second less common causative locus is found at 1p34 known as vws locus 2 vws2 more recent work has shown that grhl3 is the vws2 gene grhl3 is downstream of irf6 in oral epithlium suggesting a common molecular pathway leading to vws prior work also suggested wdr65 as a candidate gene   irf6 contains two noncoding and seven coding exons and is part of a family of nine transcription factors with a highly conserved helixturnhelix dna binding domain called the smadinterferon regulatory factor binding domain smir mutations in coding or noncoding irf6 exons can result in van der woude syndrome  due to the wide range of expressivity it is also believed that other unidentified loci contribute to disease development  an example of the clear phenotypic variability is a monozygotic twin study conducted by jobling et al 2010 two monozygotic female twins had the same irf6 mutation however twin a was born with a bilateral cleft lip whereas twin b had bilateral lip pits and no orofacial clefting both twins were diagnosed with vws the twins father had lip pits alone and a family history of clp cp cl andor lip pits both twins were diagnosed with vws polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification was done for all exons of irf6 and a missense mutation was discovered in exon 4 the tyrosine in the normal protein at this position is conserved across mammals frogs and chickens so despite the fact that it was a previously unreported mutation it was expected to be deleterious this study is not the first case of different phenotypes occurring between monozygotic twins possible causes of phenotypic variability include variations in the intrauterine environment epigenetic differences or chance effects  lip pits were first reported in 1845 by demarquay who thought they were indentations made by the upper incisors today it is known that they occur during embryogenesis due to irf6 mutations on day 32 of embryonic development there are four growth centers of the lower lip divided by two lateral grooves and one median by day 38 of normal development the grooves have disappeared however when growth of the mandibular process is impeded a lip pit occurs lip pits begin to develop on day 36 cleft lip begins to develop on day 40 and cleft palate emerges on day 50 of development  there are three types of lip pits which are classified according to their location midline upper comissural and lower lip the most common phenotype is two symmetrical lower lip pits flanking both sides of the midline in the bilateral paramedial sinuses lower lip pits may also be bilaterally unilaterally or medially asymmetrical the occurrence of a single lip pit is considered incomplete expression and it typically occurs on the left side of the lower lip there are also three different shapes for lip pits the most common being circular or oval less common forms include slitlike or transverse the lip pits extend into the orbicularis oris muscle ending in blind sacs surrounded by mucous glands in some cases mucous is excreted when the muscles contract  clinical diagnosis based on orofacial clefts and lip pits typically occurs shortly after birth certain defects may be difficult to diagnose particularly a submucous cleft palate this form of cp may not be detected except through finger palpation as the mucosa covering the palate is intact but the muscles underneath have lost their proper attachments feeding problems impaired speech and hearing loss are symptoms of a submucous cleft palate  furthermore approximately 15 of vws cases with orofacial clefts in the absence of prominent lip pits cannot be easily distinguished from nonsyndromic forms of orofacial clefting  therefore it is very important to closely examine these patients as well as their relatives for lip pits especially when there is a family history of mixed clefting in order to make the vws diagnosis  dentists may also play an important role in diagnosing cases not detected at birth as they detect hypodontia commonly associated with vws the patients most commonly lack the upper second premolars followed by the lower second premolars and upper lateral incisors the absence of these teeth might play a role in the constricting of the dental arches   the clinical signs seen in vws are similar to those of popliteal pterygium syndrome pps which is also an autosomal dominant disease approximately 46 of affected individuals have lip pits other features include genital abnormalities abnormal skin near nails syndactyly of fingers and toes and webbed skin the disease is also caused by mutations in irf6 however they occur in the dnabinding domain of irf6 and result in a dominant negative effect in which the mutated irf6 transcription factor interferes with the ability of the wild type copy to function in the case of a heterozygous individual  lip pits may be surgically removed either for aesthetic reasons or discomfort due to inflammation caused by bacterial infections or chronic saliva excretion though spontaneous shrinkage of the lip pits has occurred in some rare cases chronic inflammation has also been reported to cause squamouscell carcinoma it is essential to completely remove the entire lip pit canal as mucoid cysts can develop if mucous glands are not removed a possible side effect of removing the lip pits is a loose lip muscle other conditions associated with vws including cl cp congenital heart defects etc are surgically corrected or otherwise treated as they would be if they were nonsyndromic  genetic counseling for vws involves discussion of disease transmission in the autosomal dominant manner and possibilities for penetrance and expression in offspring  autosomal dominance means affected parents have a 50 chance of passing on their mutated irf6 allele to a their child furthermore if a cleft patient has lip pits he or she has a ten times greater risk of having a child with cleft lip with or without cleft palate than a cleft patient who does not have lip pits  types of clefting between parents and affected children are significantly associated however different types of clefts may occur horizontally and vertically within the same pedigree in cases where clefting is the only symptom a complete family history must be taken to ensure the patient does not have nonsyndromic clefting

V a bochdalek hernia is one of two forms of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia the other form being morgagni hernia a bochdalek hernia is a congenital abnormality in which an opening exists in the infants diaphragm allowing normally intraabdominal organs particularly the stomach and intestines to protrude into the thoracic cavity in the majority of patients the affected lung will be deformed  and the resulting lung compression can be lifethreatening bochdalek hernias occur more commonly on the posterior left side 85 versus right side 15   most likely bochdalek hernias are formed throughout the growth process and organ construction during fetal development during fetal development the diaphragm is formed between the seventh and tenth week also during this time the esophagus stomach and intestines are formed therefore a bochdalek hernia forms either from malformation of the diaphragm or the intestines become locked into the chest cavity during the construction of the diaphragm although these are some factors that contribute to a bochdalek hernia it does not take all variables into account bochdalek hernias along with morgagni hernias are both multifactor conditions meaning that there are many reasons and multiple variables that contribute to the malformations for example in each case there could be genetic and or environmental conditions that can add to the probability of this birth defect  bochdalek hernias make up about 017 to 6 of all diaphragmatic hernia cases and about one in every 2200 to 12500 births every year  babies who are born with a bochdalek hernia are more than likely to have another birth defect caused by the hernia about twenty percent of those children born with a bochdalek hernia also have a congenital heart defect in addition infants born with this condition may also have other abnormalities between five and sixteen percent of infants have a chromosomal abnormality  in most cases leftsided hernias or bochdalek hernias have a ratio of 32 of males to females in other words bochdalek hernias are more common in men bochdalek hernia can be a lifethreatening condition approximately 853 of newborns born with a bochdalek hernia are immediately high risk  infants born with a bochdalek hernia have a high mortality rate due to respiratory insufficiency  between 2560 of infants die from a bochdalek hernia  the lungs diaphragm and digestive system are all forming at the same time so when a bochdalek hernia permits the abdominal organs to invade the chest cavity rather than remain under the diaphragm in the correct position it puts the infant in critical condition these foreign bodies in the chest cavity compress the lungs impairing their proper development and causing pulmonary hypoplasia  since the lungs of infants suffering from a bochdalek hernia have fewer alveoli than normal lungs bochdalek hernias are lifethreatening conditions due to respiratory distress  also if the invasion of the intestine or stomach punctures the lung then the lungs cannot fill completely with air the baby will not be healthy or stable with this condition because he or she cannot take in enough air and oxygen to keep the body operating properly like the lungs the intestines may also have trouble developing correctly if the intestines are trapped within the lungs then the lungs and intestines may not be receiving the amount of blood they need to stay healthy and function properly in normal bochdalek hernia cases the symptoms are often observable simultaneously with the babys birth a few of the symptoms of a bochdalek hernia include difficulty breathing fast respiration and increased heart rate also if the baby appears to have cyanosis bluetinted skin this can also be a sign  another way to differentiate a healthy baby from a baby with bochdalek hernia is to look at the chest immediately after birth if the baby has a bochdalek hernia it may appear that one side of the chest cavity is larger than the other and or the abdomen seems to be concave caved in  one way to determine if a baby does in fact have a bochdalek hernia would be to have a pediatrician perform a physical on the infant a chest xray can also be done to examine the abnormalities of not only the lungs but also the diaphragm and the intestine in addition to these a doctor can also take a blood test drawing arterial blood to check and determine how well the baby is breathing and his or her ability to breathe a chromosomal test done by testing the blood can also be performed to determine whether or not the problem was genetic the doctors can also take an ultrasound of the heart echocardiogram to evaluate the health of the heart in order to treat a bochdalek hernia the babys physician must take into account multiple factors first the diagnosis will vary depending on whether the bochdalek hernia was found during fetal development or after birth the key to survival lies in prompt diagnosis and treatment   second the babys overall health and medical history will be evaluated third the doctor will look at the seriousness of the condition fourth the baby will need to be evaluated at the level of medication procedure and therapy he or she can handle and finally the doctor will take into consideration the opinion and preference of the parents after these things are all taken into consideration and evaluated the doctor will determine how to treat the baby there are three different treatments available the first treatment includes the babys admission into the nicu neonatal intensive care unit  in most bochdalek hernia cases babies who are admitted in the nicu are placed on a mechanical ventilator to help breathing another treatment involves putting the infants on a temporary heartlung bypass machine called an ecmo  this normally pertains to children who have severe problems ecmo performs the tasks the regularly functioning hearts and lungs do ecmo allows oxygen to be regulated into the blood and then pumps the blood throughout the entire body normally this machine is used to stabilize the babys condition the third option in treatment is surgery  after the baby is stable and his or her state has improved the diaphragm can be fixed and the misplaced organs can be relocated to their correct position  although these are various treatments for bochdalek hernias it does not guarantee the baby will survive  since the baby must go through some or all of the previous treatments the babys hospital stay is usually longer than that of a normal newborn the average infants born with a bochdalek hernia stay in the hospital between 231 and 268 days  a useful way to remember the localization of this hernia vs morgagni is bochdalek is back and to the left re the posterolateral localization

V warfarin also known by the brand names coumadin among others is an anticoagulant normally used in the prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels and their migration elsewhere in the body respectively it was initially introduced in 1948 as a pesticide against rats and mice and is still used for this purpose although more potent poisons such as brodifacoum have since been developed in the early 1950s warfarin was found to be effective and relatively safe for preventing thrombosis and thromboembolism in many disorders it was approved for use as a medication in 1954 and has remained popular ever since warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant drug in north america  despite its effectiveness treatment with warfarin has several shortcomings many commonly used medications interact with warfarin as do some foods particularly leaf vegetable foods or greens since these typically contain large amounts of vitamin k1 and its activity has to be monitored by blood testing for the international normalized ratio inr to ensure an adequate yet safe dose is taken  a high inr predisposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding while an inr below the therapeutic target indicates the dose of warfarin is insufficient to protect against thromboembolic events warfarin and related 4hydroxycoumarincontaining molecules decrease blood coagulation by inhibiting vitamin k epoxide reductase an enzyme that recycles oxidized vitamin k1 to its reduced form after it has participated in the carboxylation of several blood coagulation proteins mainly prothrombin and factor vii despite being labeled a vitamin k antagonist  warfarin does not antagonize the action of vitamin k1 but rather antagonizes vitamin k1 recycling depleting active vitamin k1  thus the pharmacologic action may always be reversed by fresh vitamin k1 when administered these drugs do not anticoagulate blood immediately instead onset of their effect requires about two to three days before remaining active clotting factors have had time to naturally disappear in metabolism and the duration of action of a single dose of warfarin is 2 to 5 days reversal of warfarins effect by discontinuing its use or by administering vitamin k1 requires a similar period of time warfarin is a synthetic derivative of dicoumarol a 4hydroxycoumarinderived mycotoxin anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet cloverbased animal feeds dicoumarol in turn is derived from coumarin a sweetsmelling but coagulationinactive chemical found naturally in sweet clover to which it gives its odor and name tonka beans also known as cumaru from which coumarins name derives and many other plants the name warfarin stems from its discovery at the university of wisconsin incorporating the acronym for the organization that funded the key research warf for the wisconsin alumni research foundation and the ending arin indicating its link with coumarin warfarin is used to decrease the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis prevention of further episodes in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot thrombus warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help reduce the risk of embolism migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ  warfarin is best suited for anticoagulation clot formation inhibition in areas of slowly running blood such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria thus common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation the presence of artificial heart valves deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism where the embolized clots first form in veins warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome it has been used occasionally after heart attacks myocardial infarctions but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs which act by a different mechanism from warfarin which normally has no effect on platelet function  in some countries other coumarins are used instead of warfarin such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon these have a shorter acenocoumarol or longer phenprocoumon halflife and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring such as dabigatran apixaban and rivaroxaban have been approved in a number of countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation and others in the same drug classes are under development however reversal agents for these alternative anticoagulants are currently not available  dosing of warfarin is complicated because it is known to interact with many commonly used medications and certain foods  these interactions may enhance or reduce warfarins anticoagulation effect to optimize the therapeutic effect without risking dangerous side effects such as bleeding close monitoring of the degree of anticoagulation is required by a blood test measuring an inr during the initial stage of treatment inr is checked daily intervals between tests can be lengthened if the patient manages stable therapeutic inr levels on an unchanged warfarin dose  newer pointofcare testing is available and has increased the ease of inr testing in the outpatient setting instead of a blood draw the point of care test involves a simple finger prick  when initiating warfarin therapy warfarinization the doctor will decide how strong the anticoagulant therapy needs to be the target inr level varies from case to case depending on the clinical indicators but tends to be 23 in most conditions in particular target inr may be 2535 or even 3045 in patients with one or more mechanical heart valves  in addition for the first three days of warfarinization the levels of protein c and protein s anticoagulation factors drop faster than procoagulation proteins such as factor ii vii ix and x therefore bridging anticoagulant therapies usually heparin are often used to reverse this temporary hypercoagulable state recommendations by many national bodies including the american college of chest physicians  have been distilled to help manage dose adjustments  the maintenance dose of warfarin can fluctuate significantly depending on the amount of vitamin k1 in the diet keeping vitamin k1 intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin k1 green parts of members of the family apiaceae such as parsley cilantro and dill are extremely rich sources of vitamin k cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens are also relatively high in vitamin k1 green vegetables such a peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin k1 as leafy greens certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin k1 foods low in vitamin k1 include roots bulbs tubers and most fruits and fruit juices cereals grains and other milled products are also low in vitamin k1  patients are making increasing use of selftesting and home monitoring of oral anticoagulation international guidelines on home testing were published in 2005  the guidelines stated the consensus agrees that patient selftesting and patient selfmanagement are effective methods of monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy providing outcomes at least as good as and possibly better than those achieved with an anticoagulation clinic all patients must be appropriately selected and trained currently available selftestingselfmanagement devices give inr results that are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing  a 2006 systematic review and metaanalysis of 14 randomized trials showed home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications thrombosis and major bleeding and improved the time in the therapeutic range  warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy as it passes through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion stillbirth neonatal death and preterm birth  coumarins such as warfarin are also teratogens that is they cause birth defects the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5 although higher figures up to 30 have been reported in some studies  depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise  usually warfarin is avoided in the first trimester and a low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin is substituted with heparin risk of maternal haemorrhage and other complications are still increased but heparins do not cross the placental barrier so do not cause birth defects  various solutions exist for the time around delivery when warfarin or another 4hydroxycoumarin derivative is given during the first trimesterparticularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancya constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome fws warfarin embryopathy or coumarin embryopathy can occur fws is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities which include nasal hypoplasia a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge scoliosis and calcifications in the vertebral column femur and heel bone which show a peculiar stippled appearance on xrays limb abnormalities such as brachydactyly unusually short fingers and toes or underdeveloped extremities can also occur   common nonskeletal features of fws include low birth weight and developmental disabilities   warfarin administration in the second and third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects and when they do occur are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome the most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders including spasticity and seizures and eye defects   because of such later pregnancy birth defects anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves according to the american college of chest physicians accp warfarin may be used in lactating women who wish to breastfeed their infants  available data does not suggest that warfarin crosses into the breast milk similarly inr levels should be checked to avoid adverse effects  the only common side effect of warfarin is hemorrhage bleeding the risk of severe bleeding is small but definite a median annual rate of 13 has been reported  and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered as a therapeutic measure all types of bleeding occur more commonly but the most catastrophic ones are those involving the brain intracerebral hemorrhagehemorrhagic stroke and the spinal cord  risk of bleeding is increased if the inr is out of range due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions  this risk increases greatly once the inr exceeds 45  a number of risk scores exists to predict bleeding in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants a commonly used score hasbled includes known predictors of warfarinrelated bleeding uncontrolled high blood pressure h abnormal kidney function a previous stroke s known previous bleeding condition b previous labile inr when on anticoagulation l elderly as defined by age over 65 e and drugs associated with bleeding eg aspirin or alcohol misuse d while their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines  they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke  bleeding risk may be increased in patients on hemodialysis  another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation specifically warfarin or coumadin is the atria score which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification  the risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  a rare but serious complication resulting from treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment in patients with a deficiency of protein c protein c is an innate anticoagulant that like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits requires vitamin kdependent carboxylation for its activity since warfarin initially decreases protein c levels faster than the coagulation factors it can paradoxically increase the bloods tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs its natural counterpart purpura fulminans occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein c mutations  after initial reports that warfarin could reduce bone mineral density several studies have demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosisrelated fracture a 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased other fracture types did not occur more commonly  a 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture  a 2006 retrospective study of 14564 medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60 increased risk of osteoporosisrelated fracture in men there was no association in women the mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin k which is necessary for bone health and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin kmediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins rendering them nonfunctional  another rare complication that may occur early during warfarin treatment usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement is purple toe syndrome this condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood vessels in the skin of the feet which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful it is typically thought to affect the big toe but it affects other parts of the feet as well including the bottom of the foot plantar surface the occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin  several studies have also implicated warfarin use in valvular and vascular calcification no specific treatment is available but some modalities are under investigation  the major side effect of warfarin use is bleeding risk of bleeding is increased if the inr is out of range due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions  many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin also causing an overdose  for people who need rapid reversal of warfarin and have serious bleeding or who are having emergency surgery the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin k with prothrombin complex concentrate or fresh frozen plasma in addition to intravenous vitamin k  blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin when vitamin k could work alone  details on reversing warfarin are provided in clinical practice guidelines from the american college of chest physicians  for patients with an international normalized ratio inr between 45 and 100 a small dose about 1000 mcg  one milligram of oral vitamin k is sufficient when warfarin is being given and inr is in therapeutic range simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause inr to drop below 15  warfarin interacts with many commonly used drugs and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients  some foods have also been reported to interact with warfarin  apart from the metabolic interactions highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause an increase in the inr  this makes finding the correct dosage difficult and accentuates the need of monitoring when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin eg simvastatin inr checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found many commonly used antibiotics such as metronidazole or the macrolides will greatly increase the effect of warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body other broadspectrum antibiotics can reduce the amount of the normal bacterial flora in the bowel which make significant quantities of vitamin k1 thus potentiating the effect of warfarin  in addition food that contains large quantities of vitamin k1 will reduce the warfarin effect   thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements  hypothyroidism decreased thyroid function makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment  while hyperthyroidism overactive thyroid boosts the anticoagulant effect  several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin   excessive use of alcohol is also known to affect the metabolism of warfarin and can elevate the inr and thus increase the risk of bleeding  the us food and drug administration fda product insert on warfarin states that alcohol should be avoided  warfarin also interacts with many herbs and spices  some used in food such as ginger and garlic and others used purely for medicinal purposes such as ginseng and ginkgo biloba all may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin similar effects have been reported with borage starflower oil or fish oils  st johns wort sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression reduces the effectiveness of a given dose of warfarin it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body causing a reduced anticoagulant effect  between 2003 and 2004 the uk committee on safety of medicines received several reports of increased inr and risk of haemorrhage in people taking warfarin and cranberry juice    data establishing a causal relationship is still lacking and a 2006 review found no cases of this interaction reported to the fda  nevertheless several authors have recommended that both doctors and patients be made aware of its possibility  the mechanism behind the interaction is still unclear  xray crystallographic studies of warfarin show that it exists in tautomeric form as the cyclic hemiketal which is formed from the 4hydroxycoumarin and the ketone in the 3position substituent  however the existence of many 4hydroxycoumadin anticoagulants for example phenprocoumon that possess no ketone group in the 3substituent to form such a structure suggests that the hemiketal must hydrolyze to the 4hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active  warfarin consists of a racemic mixture of two active enantiomersr and s formseach of which is cleared by different pathways swarfarin is 25 times more potent than the risomer in producing an anticoagulant response  both the enentiomers of warfarin undergo cyp mediated metabolism by many different cyps to form 34678 and 10hydroxy warfarin metabolites major being 7oh warfarin formed from swarfarin by cyp2c9 and 10oh warfarin from rwarfarib by cyp3a4  warfarin is sloweracting than the common anticoagulant heparin though it has a number of advantages heparin must be given by injection whereas warfarin is available orally warfarin has a long halflife and need only be given once a day heparin can also cause a prothrombotic condition heparininduced thrombocytopenia an antibodymediated decrease in platelet levels which increases the risk for thrombosis it takes several days for warfarin to reach the therapeutic effect since the circulating coagulation factors are not affected by the drug thrombin has a halflife time of days warfarins long halflife means that it remains effective for several days after it was stopped furthermore if given initially without additional anticoagulant cover it can increase thrombosis risk see below for these main reasons hospitalised patients are usually given heparin with warfarin initially the heparin covering the 35 day lag period and being withdrawn after a few days while warfarin is one of several drugs popularly referred to as a blood thinner this is a misnomer since it does not affect the viscosity of blood warfarin inhibits the vitamin kdependent synthesis of biologically active forms of the calciumdependent clotting factors ii vii ix and x as well as the regulatory factors protein c protein s and protein z   other proteins not involved in blood clotting such as osteocalcin or matrix gla protein may also be affected the precursors of these factors require carboxylation of their glutamic acid residues to allow the coagulation factors to bind to phospholipid surfaces inside blood vessels on the vascular endothelium the enzyme that carries out the carboxylation of glutamic acid is gammaglutamyl carboxylase the carboxylation reaction will proceed only if the carboxylase enzyme is able to convert a reduced form of vitamin k vitamin k hydroquinone to vitamin k epoxide at the same time the vitamin k epoxide is in turn recycled back to vitamin k and vitamin k hydroquinone by another enzyme the vitamin k epoxide reductase vkor warfarin inhibits epoxide reductase  specifically the vkorc1 subunit   thereby diminishing available vitamin k and vitamin k hydroquinone in the tissues which inhibits the carboxylation activity of the glutamyl carboxylase when this occurs the coagulation factors are no longer carboxylated at certain glutamic acid residues and are incapable of binding to the endothelial surface of blood vessels and are thus biologically inactive as the bodys stores of previously produced active factors degrade over several days and are replaced by inactive factors the anticoagulation effect becomes apparent the coagulation factors are produced but have decreased functionality due to undercarboxylation they are collectively referred to as pivkas proteins induced by vitamin k absenceantagonism and individual coagulation factors as pivkanumber egpivkaii the end result of warfarin use therefore is to diminish blood clotting in the patient when warfarin is newly started it may promote clot formation temporarily this is because the level of protein c and protein s are also dependent on vitamin k activity warfarin causes decline in protein c levels in first 36 hours in addition reduced levels of protein s lead to a reduction in activity of protein c for which it is the cofactor and therefore reduced degradation of factor va and factor viiia although loading doses of warfarin over 5mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor vii resulting in an initial prolongation of the inr full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor ii occurs days later the haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation leading to a prothrombotic state thus when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5mg per day it is beneficial to coadminister heparin an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis with warfarin therapy for four to five days in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved   warfarin activity is determined partially by genetic factors polymorphisms in two genes vkorc1 and cyp2c9 play a particularly large role in response to warfarin vkorc1 polymorphisms explain 30 of the dose variation between patients  particular mutations make vkorc1 less susceptible to suppression by warfarin  there are two main haplotypes that explain 25 of variation lowdose haplotype group a and a highdose haplotype group b  vkorc1 polymorphisms explain why african americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin higher proportion of group b haplotypes while asian americans are generally more sensitive higher proportion of group a haplotypes  group a vkorc1 polymorphisms lead to a more rapid achievement of a therapeutic inr but also a shorter time to reach an inr over 4 which is associated with bleeding  cyp2c9 polymorphisms explain 10 of the dose variation between patients  mainly among caucasian patients as these variants are rare in african american and most asian populations  these cyp2c9 polymorphisms do not influence time to effective inr as opposed tovkorc1 but does shorten the time to inr 4  despite the promise of pharmacogenomic testing in warfarin dosing its use in clinical practice is controversial in august 2009 the centers for medicare and medicaid services concluded that the available evidence does not demonstrate that pharmacogenomic testing of cyp2c9 or vkorc1 alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness improves health outcomes in medicare beneficiaries  a 2014 metaanalysis showed that using genotypebased dosing did not confer benefit in terms of time within therapeutic range excessive anticoagulation as defined by inr greater than 4 or a reduction in either major bleeding or thromboembolic events  in the early 1920s there was an outbreak of a previously unrecognised cattle disease in the northern united states and canada cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions spontaneously for example 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration all of these animals had bled to death  in 1921 frank schofield a canadian veterinary pathologist determined that the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover and that this was functioning as a potent anticoagulant only spoiled hay made from sweet clover grown in northern states of the usa and in canada since the turn of the century produced the disease  schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow and fed each to a different rabbit the rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness a duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result  in 1929 north dakota veterinarian dr lm roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin  the identity of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940 in 1933 karl paul link and his lab of chemists working at the university of wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay it took five years for links student harold a campbell to recover 6mg of crystalline anticoagulant next links student mark a stahmann took over the project and initiated a largescale extraction isolating 18 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months this was enough material for stahmann and charles f huebner to check their results against campbells and to thoroughly characterize the compound through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 33methylenebis4hydroxycoumarin which they later named dicoumarol they confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent  dicoumarol was a product of the plant molecule coumarin not to be confused with coumadin a later tradename for warfarin coumarin is now known to be present in many plants and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like sweet grass in fact the plants high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of sweet clover which is named for its sweet smell not its bitter taste  they are present notably in woodruff galium odoratum rubiaceae and at lower levels in licorice lavender and various other species however coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarinlike action but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4hydroxycoumarin then further in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde into dicoumarol in order to have any anticoagulant properties fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages dicoumarol is considered to be a fermentation product and mycotoxin  over the next few years numerous similar chemicals specifically 4hydroxycoumarins with a large aromatic substitutent at the 3 position were found to have the same anticoagulant properties the first drug in the class to be widely commercialized was dicoumarol itself patented in 1941 and later used as a pharmaceutical karl link continued working on developing more potent coumarinbased anticoagulants for use as rodent poisons resulting in warfarin in 1948 the name warfarin stems from the acronym warf for wisconsin alumni research foundation  the ending arin indicating its link with coumarin warfarin was first registered for use as a rodenticide in the us in 1948 and was immediately popular although warfarin was developed by link the wisconsin alumni research foundation financially supported the research and was assigned the patent  after an incident in 1951 where a us army inductee unsuccessfully attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide and recovered fully after presenting to a hospital and being treated with vitamin k by then known as a specific antidote  studies began in the use of warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant it was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans an early recipient of warfarin was us president dwight eisenhower who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955  the exact mechanism of action remained unknown until it was demonstrated in 1978 that warfarin inhibits the enzyme epoxide reductase and hence interferes with vitamin k metabolism  it has been posited that lavrenty beria nikita khrushchev and others conspired to use warfarin to poison soviet leader joseph stalin warfarin is tasteless and colourless and produces symptoms similar to those that stalin exhibited  coumarins 4hydroxycoumarin derivatives are used as rodenticides for controlling rats and mice in residential industrial and agricultural areas warfarin is both odorless and tasteless and is effective when mixed with food bait because the rodents will return to the bait and continue to feed over a period of days until a lethal dose is accumulated considered to be 1mgkgday over about six days it may also be mixed with talc and used as a tracking powder which accumulates on the animals skin and fur and is subsequently consumed during grooming the ld50 is 50500mgkg the idlh value is 100mgm  warfarin various species  the use of warfarin itself as a rat poison is now declining because many rat populations have developed resistance to it and poisons of considerably greater potency are now available other 4hydroxycoumarins used as rodenticides include coumatetralyl and brodifacoum which is sometimes referred to as superwarfarin because it is more potent longeracting and effective even in rat and mouse populations that are resistant to warfarin unlike warfarin which is readily excreted newer anticoagulant poisons also accumulate in the liver and kidneys after ingestion  however such rodenticides may also accumulate in birds of prey and other animals that eat the poisoned rodents or baits  people can be exposed to warfarin in the workplace by breathing it in swallowing it skin absorption and eye contact the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for warfarin exposure in the workplace as 01mgm  over an 8hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of 01mgm  over an 8hour workday at levels of 100mgm  warfarin is immediately dangerous to life and health  brand names include coumadin jantoven marevan uniwarfin lawarin and waran

V flat feet also called pes planus or fallen arches is a postural deformity in which the arches of the foot collapse with the entire sole of the foot coming into complete or nearcomplete contact with the ground some individuals an estimated 2030 of the general population have an arch that simply never develops in one foot unilaterally or both feet bilaterally there is a functional relationship between the structure of the arch of the foot and the biomechanics of the lower leg the arch provides an elastic springy connection between the forefoot and the hind foot this association safeguards that a majority of the forces incurred during weight bearing of the foot can be dissipated before the force reaches the long bones of the leg and thigh  in pes planus the head of the talus bone is displaced medially and distal from the navicular as a result the spring ligament and the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle are stretched so much so that the individual with pes planus loses the function of the medial longitudinal arch mla if the mla is absent or nonfunctional in both the seated and standing positions the individual has rigid flatfoot if the mla is present and functional while the individual is sitting or standing up on their toes but this arch disappears when assuming a footflat stance the individual has supple flatfoot this latter condition can be correctable with wellfitting arch supports  three studies see citations below in military section of military recruits have shown no evidence of later increased injury or foot problems due to flat feet in a population of people who reach military service age without prior foot problems however these studies cannot be used to judge possible future damage from this condition when diagnosed at younger ages they also cannot be applied to persons whose flat feet are associated with foot symptoms or certain symptoms in other parts of the body such as the leg or back possibly referable to the foot   the appearance of flat feet is normal and common in infants partly due to baby fat which masks the developing arch and partly because the arch has not yet fully developed the human arch develops in infancy and early childhood as part of normal muscle tendon ligament and bone growth training of the feet especially by foot gymnastics and going barefoot on varying terrain can facilitate the formation of arches during childhood with a developed arch occurring for most by the age of four to six years flat arches in children usually become proper arches and high arches while the child progresses through adolescence and into adulthood because young children are unlikely to suspect or identify flat feet on their own it is a good idea for parents or other adult caregivers to check on this themselves besides visual inspection parents should notice whether a child begins to walk oddly or clumsily for example on the outer edges of the feet or to limp during long walks and to ask the child whether he or she feels foot pain or fatigue during such walks children who complain about calf muscle pains or any other pains around the foot area may be developing or have flat feet pain or discomfort may also develop in the knee joints a recent randomized controlled trial found no evidence for the efficacy of treatment of flat feet in children either for expensive prescribed orthoses shoe inserts or less expensive overthecounter orthoses  going barefoot particularly over terrain such as a beach where muscles are given a good workout is good for all but the most extremely flatfooted or those with certain related conditions such as plantar fasciitis ligament laxity is also among the factors known to be associated with flat feet one medical study in india with a large sample size of children who had grown up wearing shoes and others going barefoot found that the longitudinal arches of the bare footers were generally strongest and highest as a group and that flat feet were less common in children who had grown up wearing sandals or slippers than among those who had worn closedtoe shoes focusing on the influence of footwear on the prevalence of pes planus the crosssectional study performed on children noted that wearing shoes throughout early childhood can be detrimental to the development of a normal or a high medial longitudinal arch the vulnerability for flat foot among shoewearing children increases if the child has an associated ligament laxity condition the results of the study suggest that children be encouraged to play barefooted on various surfaces of terrain and that slippers and sandals are less harmful compared to closedtoe shoes it appeared that closedtoe shoes greatly inhibited the development of the arch of the foot more so than slippers or sandals this conclusion may be a result of the notion that intrinsic muscle activity of the arch is required to prevent slippers and sandals from falling off the childs foot  flat feet can also develop as an adult adult acquired flatfoot due to injury illness unusual or prolonged stress to the foot faulty biomechanics  or as part of the normal aging process this is most common in women over 40 years of age known risk factors include obesity hypertension and diabetes  flat feet can also occur in pregnant women as a result of temporary changes due to increased elastin elasticity during pregnancy however if developed by adulthood flat feet generally remain flat permanently if a youth or adult appears flatfooted while standing in a full weight bearing position but an arch appears when the person plantarflexes or pulls the toes back with the rest of the foot flat on the floor this condition is called flexible flatfoot this is not a true collapsed arch as the medial longitudinal arch is still present and the windlass mechanism still operates this presentation is actually due to excessive pronation of the foot rolling inwards although the term flat foot is still applicable as it is a somewhat generic term muscular training of the feet is helpful and will often result in increased arch height regardless of age research has shown that tendon specimens from people who suffer from adult acquired flat feet show evidence of increased activity of proteolytic enzymes these enzymes can break down the constituents of the involved tendons and cause the foot arch to fall in the future these enzymes may become targets for new drug therapies  many medical professionals can diagnose a flat foot by examining the patient standing or just looking at them on going up onto tip toe the deformity will correct when this is a flexible flat foot in a child with lax joints such correction is not seen in adults with a rigid flat foot an easy and traditional home diagnosis is the wet footprint test performed by wetting the feet in water and then standing on a smooth level surface such as smooth concrete or thin cardboard or heavy paper usually the more the sole of the foot that makes contact leaves a footprint the flatter the foot in more extreme cases known as a kinked flatfoot the entire inner edge of the footprint may actually bulge outward where in a normal to high arch this part of the sole of the foot does not make contact with the ground at all most flexible flat feet are asymptomatic and do not cause pain in these cases there is usually no cause for concern and the condition may be considered a normal human variant flat feet were formerly a physicalhealth reason for servicerejection in many militaries however three military studies on asymptomatic adults see section below suggest that persons with asymptomatic flat feet are at least as tolerant of foot stress as the population with various grades of arch asymptomatic flat feet are no longer a service disqualification in the us military  in a study performed to analyze the activation of the tibialis posterior muscle in adults with pes planus it was noted that the tendon of this muscle may be dysfunctional and lead to disabling weightbearing symptoms associated with acquired flat foot deformity the results of the study indicated that while barefoot subjects activated additional lowerleg muscles to complete an exercise that resisted foot adduction however when the same subjects performed the exercise while wearing arch supporting orthotics and shoes the tibialis posterior was selectively activated such discoveries suggest that the use of shoes with properly fitting archsupporting orthics will enhance selective activation of the tibialis posterior muscle thus acting as an adequate treatment for the undesirable symptoms of pes planus  rigid flatfoot a condition where the sole of the foot is rigidly flat even when a person is not standing often indicates a significant problem in the bones of the affected feet and can cause pain in about a quarter of those affected   other flatfootrelated conditions such as various forms of tarsal coalition two or more bones in the midfoot or hindfoot abnormally joined or an accessory navicular extra bone on the inner side of the foot should be treated promptly usually by the very early teen years before a childs bone structure firms up permanently as a young adult both tarsal coalition and an accessory navicular can be confirmed by xray rheumatoid arthritis can destroy tendons in the foot or both feet which can cause this condition and untreated can result in deformity and early onset of osteoarthritis of the joint such a condition can cause severe pain and considerably reduced ability to walk even with orthoses ankle fusion is usually recommended  treatment of flat feet may also be appropriate if there is associated foot or lower leg pain or if the condition affects the knees or the lower back treatment may include using orthoses such as an arch support foot gymnastics or other exercises as recommended by a podiatristorthotist or physical therapist in cases of severe flat feet orthoses should be used through a gradual process to lessen discomfort over several weeks slightly more material is added to the orthosis to raise the arch these small changes allow the foot structure to adjust gradually as well as giving the patient time to acclimatise to the sensation of wearing orthoses once prescribed orthoses are generally worn for the rest of the patients life in some cases surgery can provide lasting relief and even create an arch where none existed before it should be considered a last resort as it is usually very time consuming and costly  it is generally assumed by running professionals primarily including some physical trainers podiatrists and shoe manufacturers that a person with flat feet tends to overpronate in his or her running form  however some also assert that persons with flat feet may have an underpronating if not a neutral gait with standard running shoes these professionals claim a person who overpronates in his or her running form may be more susceptible to shin splints back problems and tendonitis in the knee   running in shoes with extra medial support or using special shoe inserts orthoses may help correct ones running form by reducing pronation and may reduce risk of injury  studies analyzing the correlation between flat feet and physical injury in soldiers have been inconclusive but none suggests that flat feet are an impediment at least in soldiers who reached the age of military recruitment without prior foot problems instead in this population there is a suggestion of more injury in high arched feet a 2005 study of royal australian air force recruits that tracked the recruits over the course of their basic training found that neither flat feet nor high arched feet had any impact on physical functioning injury rates or foot health if anything there was a tendency for those with flat feet to have fewer injuries  another study of 295 israel defense forces recruits found that those with high arches suffered almost four times as many stress fractures as those with the lowest arches  a later study of 449 us navy special warfare trainees found no significant difference in the incidence of stress fractures among sailors and marines with different arch heights

V amniotic band constriction also known as amniotic band syndrome adam complex amniotic band sequence congenital constriction bands and pseudoainhum  is a congenital disorder caused by entrapment of fetal parts usually a limb or digits in fibrous amniotic bands while in utero   the constriction of appendages by amniotic bands may result in a strong relationship between abs and clubfoot also called talipes exists a 315 of associated clubfoot deformity and abs can be correlated with 20 occurring bilaterally other abnormalities found with abs include clubhands cleft lip andor cleft palate and hemangioma decreased fetal movement could be a sign of a serious problem which may include abs it is rare but possible for the membrane to become wrapped around the placenta or the neck of the baby in the womb causing strangulation and death to explain the cause of abs there are two main theories the amniotic band theory is that abs occurs due to a partial rupture of the amniotic sac this rupture involves only the amnion the chorion remains intact fibrous bands of the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can encircle and trap some part of the fetus later as the fetus grows but the bands do not the bands become constricting this constriction reduces blood circulation hence causes congenital abnormalities in some cases a complete natural amputation of a digits or limb may occur before birth or the digits or limbs may be necrotic dead and require surgical amputation following birth the vascular disruption theory because the constricting mechanism of the amniotic band theory does not explain the high incidence of cleft palate and other forms of cleft defects occurring together with abs this cooccurrence suggests an intrinsic defect of the blood circulation amniotic band syndrome is often difficult to detect before birth as the individual strands are small and hard to see on ultrasound often the bands are detected indirectly because of the constrictions and swelling upon limbs digits etc misdiagnosis is also common so if there are any signs of amniotic bands further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity 3d ultrasound and mri can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damagedanger to the fetus in rare cases if diagnosed in utero fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation or other deformity this typically would not be attempted if neither vital organs nor the umbilical cord were affected this operation has been successfully performed on fetuses as young as 22 weeks  the surgery took place at melbournes monash medical centre in australia and is believed to be the earliest surgery of its type as surgeons usually hold off on operating until the woman is in week 28 of gestation  there are also several facilities in the united states that have performed successful amniotic band release surgery treatment usually occurs after birth and where plastic and reconstructive surgery is considered to treat the resulting deformity  plastic surgery ranges from simple to complex depending on the extent of the deformity physical and occupational therapy may be needed long term prosthetics may help some abs sufferers to live more functional lives the price and complexity of these prosthetics vary dramatically but advances in 3d printing have helped to increase the availability of artificial fingers while reducing their cost of production  the prognosis depends on the location and severity of the constricting bands every case is different and multiple bands may be entangled around the fetus bands which wrap around fingers and toes can result in syndactyly or amputations of the digits in other instances bands can wrap around limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet in more severe cases the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation amniotic bands can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate if the bands become wrapped around the head or umbilical cord it can be lifethreatening for the fetus the number of cases of miscarriage that can be attributed to abs is unknown although it has been reported that it may be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages amniotic band syndrome is considered an accidental event and it does not appear to be genetic or hereditary so the likelihood of it occurring in another pregnancy is remote the cause of amnion tearing is unknown and as such there are no known preventative measures amniotic banding affects approximately 1 in 1200 live births it is also believed to be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages up to 50 of cases have other congenital anomalies including cleft lip cleft palate and clubfoot deformity hand and finger anomalies occur in up to 80 among the more notable people living with abs are

V glycine encephalopathy also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia or nkh is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of glycine metabolism after phenylketonuria glycine encephalopathy is the second most common disorder of amino acid metabolism the disease is caused by defects in the glycine cleavage system an enzyme responsible for glycine catabolism there are several forms of the disease with varying severity of symptoms and time of onset the symptoms are exclusively neurological in nature and clinically this disorder is characterized by abnormally high levels of the amino acid glycine in bodily fluids and tissues especially the cerebral spinal fluid glycine encephalopathy is sometimes referred to as nonketotic hyperglycinemia nkh as a reference to the biochemical findings seen in patients with the disorder and to distinguish it from the disorders that cause ketotic hyperglycinemia seen in propionic acidemia and several other inherited metabolic disorders to avoid confusion the term glycine encephalopathy is often used as this term more accurately describes the clinical symptoms of the disorder   glycine is the simplest amino acid having no stereoisomers it can act as a neurotransmitter in the brain act as an inhibitor in the spinal cord and brain stem while having excitatory effects in the cortex of the brain glycine is metabolized to final end products of ammonia and carbon dioxide through the glycine cleavage system gcs an enzyme complex made up of four protein subunits defects in these subunits can cause glycine encephalopathy although some causes of the disease are still unknown normally gcs shows its highest enzymatic activity in liver brain and placental tissue one of its main functions is to maintain normal glycine levels in the brain defects in gcs cause an increase of glycine concentration in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid  the exact pathophysiology of the disorder is not known but it is considered likely that buildup of glycine in the brain is responsible for the symptoms  all forms of glycine encephalopathy show elevated levels of glycine in the plasma as well as in cerebral spinal fluid csf   glycine concentrations in the csf of affected patients are typically more markedly elevated than in plasma leading to a corresponding elevation in the ratio of glycine concentrations in the cerebral spinal fluid to that in the plasma this ratio can also be slightly elevated in patients receiving valproic acid   glycine encephalopathy nonketotic hyperglycinemia or nkh should not be confused with other metabolic disorders that can produce elevated glycine levels for example certain inherited organic acidurias aka organic acidemias can produce elevated glycine in plasma and urine although these disorders are not caused by defects in the glycine cleavage system and they are not typically accompanied by corresponding elevations of glycine in cerebrospinal fluid csf  glycine encephalopathy is unique in the fact that levels of glycine are disproportionately elevated in csf in addition to elevations in blood and urine whereas csf glycine levels are normal or nearnormal in patients with inherited organic acidurias glycine is metabolized in the bodys cells to end products of carbon dioxide and ammonia the glycine cleavage system which is responsible for glycine metabolism in the mitochondria is made up of four protein subunits the pprotein hprotein tprotein and lprotein   there are several different forms of glycine encephalopathy which can be distinguished by the age of onset as well as the types and severity of symptoms all forms of glycine encephalopathy present with only neurological symptoms including mental retardation hypotonia apneic seizures and brain malformations   with the classical or neonatal presentation of glycine encephalopathy the infant is born after an unremarkable pregnancy but presents with lethargy hypotonia apneic seizures and myoclonic jerks which can progress to apnea requiring artificial ventilation and often death apneic patients can regain spontaneous respiration in their second to third week of life after recovery from the initial episode patients have intractable seizures and profound mental retardation remaining developmentally delayed some mothers comment retrospectively that they noticed fetal rhythmic hiccuping episodes during pregnancy most likely reflecting seizure episodes in utero  patients with the infantile form of glycine encephalopathy do not show lethargy and coma in the neonatal period but often have a history of hypotonia they often have seizures which can range in severity and responsiveness to treatment and they are typically developmentally delayed  glycine encephalopathy can also present as a milder form with episodic seizures ataxia movement disorders and gaze palsy during febrile illness these patients are also developmentally delayed to varying degrees in the later onset form patients typically have normal intellectual function but present with spastic diplegia and optic atrophy  transient neonatal hyperglycinemia has been described in a very small number of cases initially these patients present with the same symptoms and laboratory results that are seen in the classical presentation however levels of glycine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid typically normalize within eight weeks and in five of six cases there were no neurological issues detected at followup times up to thirteen years a single patient was severely retarded at nine months the suspected cause of transient neonatal hyperglicinemia is attributed to low activity of the glycine cleavage system in the immature brain and liver of the neonate  glycine encephalopathy has an estimated incidence of 1 in 60000 making it the second most common disorder of amino acid metabolism after phenylketonuria it is caused by a defect in the glycine cleavage system gcs which is made up of four protein subunits each of these four subunits is encoded by a separate gene defects in three of these four genes have been linked to glycine encephalopathy    there is a fourth unit in the complex dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase or gcsl however to date there have been no mutations in gcsl found to be associated with glycine encephalopathy a small percentage of affected individuals do not have detectable mutations in any of the three genes listed above that are typically associated with the disease however they still show defective glycinecleavage enzymatic activity it is thought that these patients may have mutations in the genes encoding one of the cofactors associated with the gcs complex defects in the gsc proteins can prevent the complex from functioning properly or can prevent the gcs complex from forming entirely when the complex is unable to metabolize glycine properly this causes excess glycine to build up to toxic levels in the bodys organs and tissues damage caused by elevated levels of glycine in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid is responsible for the characteristic seizures breathing difficulties movement disorders and mental retardation this disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern the term autosomal signifies that the gene associated with the disorder is located on an autosome in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern two defective copies of the gene one inherited from each parent are required in order for a child to be born with the disorder therefore each parent of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder has at least one defective copy of the gene with autosomal recessive disorders individuals with only one copy of a defective gene heterozygotes are considered carriers for the disorder carriers usually do not show signs or symptoms of the disorder

V amniotic band constriction also known as amniotic band syndrome adam complex amniotic band sequence congenital constriction bands and pseudoainhum  is a congenital disorder caused by entrapment of fetal parts usually a limb or digits in fibrous amniotic bands while in utero   the constriction of appendages by amniotic bands may result in a strong relationship between abs and clubfoot also called talipes exists a 315 of associated clubfoot deformity and abs can be correlated with 20 occurring bilaterally other abnormalities found with abs include clubhands cleft lip andor cleft palate and hemangioma decreased fetal movement could be a sign of a serious problem which may include abs it is rare but possible for the membrane to become wrapped around the placenta or the neck of the baby in the womb causing strangulation and death to explain the cause of abs there are two main theories the amniotic band theory is that abs occurs due to a partial rupture of the amniotic sac this rupture involves only the amnion the chorion remains intact fibrous bands of the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can encircle and trap some part of the fetus later as the fetus grows but the bands do not the bands become constricting this constriction reduces blood circulation hence causes congenital abnormalities in some cases a complete natural amputation of a digits or limb may occur before birth or the digits or limbs may be necrotic dead and require surgical amputation following birth the vascular disruption theory because the constricting mechanism of the amniotic band theory does not explain the high incidence of cleft palate and other forms of cleft defects occurring together with abs this cooccurrence suggests an intrinsic defect of the blood circulation amniotic band syndrome is often difficult to detect before birth as the individual strands are small and hard to see on ultrasound often the bands are detected indirectly because of the constrictions and swelling upon limbs digits etc misdiagnosis is also common so if there are any signs of amniotic bands further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity 3d ultrasound and mri can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damagedanger to the fetus in rare cases if diagnosed in utero fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation or other deformity this typically would not be attempted if neither vital organs nor the umbilical cord were affected this operation has been successfully performed on fetuses as young as 22 weeks  the surgery took place at melbournes monash medical centre in australia and is believed to be the earliest surgery of its type as surgeons usually hold off on operating until the woman is in week 28 of gestation  there are also several facilities in the united states that have performed successful amniotic band release surgery treatment usually occurs after birth and where plastic and reconstructive surgery is considered to treat the resulting deformity  plastic surgery ranges from simple to complex depending on the extent of the deformity physical and occupational therapy may be needed long term prosthetics may help some abs sufferers to live more functional lives the price and complexity of these prosthetics vary dramatically but advances in 3d printing have helped to increase the availability of artificial fingers while reducing their cost of production  the prognosis depends on the location and severity of the constricting bands every case is different and multiple bands may be entangled around the fetus bands which wrap around fingers and toes can result in syndactyly or amputations of the digits in other instances bands can wrap around limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet in more severe cases the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation amniotic bands can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate if the bands become wrapped around the head or umbilical cord it can be lifethreatening for the fetus the number of cases of miscarriage that can be attributed to abs is unknown although it has been reported that it may be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages amniotic band syndrome is considered an accidental event and it does not appear to be genetic or hereditary so the likelihood of it occurring in another pregnancy is remote the cause of amnion tearing is unknown and as such there are no known preventative measures amniotic banding affects approximately 1 in 1200 live births it is also believed to be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages up to 50 of cases have other congenital anomalies including cleft lip cleft palate and clubfoot deformity hand and finger anomalies occur in up to 80 among the more notable people living with abs are

V weaver syndrome also called weaversmith syndrome is an extremely rare congenital disorder associated with rapid growth beginning in the prenatal period and continuing through the toddler and youth years it is characterized by advanced osseous maturation and distinctive craniofacial skeletal and neurological abnormalities  it was first described by dr david weaver in 1974  it is similar to sotos syndrome   children with weaver syndrome tend to look similar and have distinctive physical and craniofacial characteristics which may include several but not all of the following features other features may include loose skin thin deepset nails thin hair short ribs limited elbow and knee extension camptodactyly and a coarse lowpitched voice delayed development of motor skills such as sitting standing and walking are commonly exhibited in early childhood patients with weaver syndrome typically have mild intellectual disability with poor coordination and balance  they also have some neurological abnormalities such as speech delay seizures mental retardation hypotonia or hypertonia and behavioral problems a common cause for weaver syndrome is mutations in the ezh2 gene on chromosome 7q36  ezh2 enhancer of zeste drosophila homolog 2 is the second histone methyltransferase associated with human overgrowth it encodes the catalytic component of the prc2 protein complex polycomb repressive complex 2 which regulates chromatin structure and gene expression and has been found to repress transcription ezh2 also has critical roles in stem cell maintenance and cell lineage determination such as osteogenesis myogenesis lymphopoiesis and hematopoiesis  it can also be associated with mutations in the histone methyltransferase nsd1 gene on chromosome 5q35 the functions of nsd1 are not clearly known but it is thought to act as a factor in influencing transcription which contains domains involved in chromatinmediated regulation during development  most cases are found to be sporadic with no family history of the syndrome although there have been a few cases in families where autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported  weaver syndrome and sotos syndrome are often mistaken for one another due to their significant phenotypic overlap and similarities  clinical features shared by both syndromes include overgrowth in early development advanced bone age developmental delay and prominent macrocephaly  mutations in the nsd1 gene may also be another cause for confusion the nsd1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in normal growth and development deletions and mutations in the nsd1 gene is a common cause for patients with sotos syndrome and in some cases for weaver syndrome as well features distinguishing weaver syndrome from sotos syndrome include broad forehead and face ocular hypertelorism prominent wide philtrum micrognathia deepset nails retrognathia with a prominent chin crease increased prenatal growth and a carpal bone age that is greatly advanced compared to metacarpal and phalangeal bone age  there is no cure available for weaver syndrome however with multidisciplinary management such as neurological pediatric orthopedic and psychomotor care and genetic counseling symptoms can be managed surgery may be used to correct any skeletal issues physical and occupational therapy are considered an option to help with muscle tone also speech therapy is often recommended for speech related problems  with appropriate treatment and management patients with weaver syndrome appear to do well both physically and intellectually throughout their life and have a normal lifespan  their adult height is normal as well

V prenatal methamphetamine exposure pme is the exposure of a prenatal fetus to methamphetamine when a woman uses the drug during her pregnancy methamphetamine ma has shown increasing popularity in the past two decades among women of childbearing age  methamphetamine is second only to cannabis as the most widely used illegal drug which may be because it is relatively cheap and easy to manufacture  yet to this date the effects of pme on the developing fetus have not been well characterized and even less is known regarding the effects on development in childhood  although few studies have established a pattern of ma use in pregnant users it is important that researchers seek to determine this pattern to examine a possible doseresponse relationship between ma use and neonatal outcomes  the recent increase in ma use in the united states particularly in the south and midwest highlights the need for a better understanding of the shortterm and longterm effects of ma use during pregnancy upon newborns and young children  the effects of ma on a fetus are often compared to those of cocaine but the neurotoxic effects of ma may be greater than those of cocaine this may be due to mas ability to remain active in the body for longer and its greater capacity to mimic the effects of neurotransmitters in the brain  studying the effects of pme is often complicated by the fact that there are numerous elements that are associated with ma use which in turn may be associated with adverse effects in exposed infants  for example depression is highly correlated with ma use which is in turn associated with less spousal support increased anxiety less prenatal care malnourishment preterm labor and more stressors in the areas of work health and environment  a study done in new zealand found that mothers referred to treatment centers for ma use were often multiple drug abusers had a history of not keeping doctors appointments and displayed mental health problems including psychotic behavior  this makes it incredibly difficult for researchers to tease apart the effects due to the drug itself versus the other influential lifestyle factors   methamphetamine ma a potent central nervous system stimulant causes a rush of dopamine norepinephrine and serotonin release in the brain when ingested  street methamphetamine is referred to by many names such as speed meth and chalk  the drug can be injected smoked snorted and even taken by oral or anal routes  the neurotransmitter release from ma ingestion especially dopamine leads to feelings of euphoria decreased appetite and fatigue and increased alertness wellbeing and exhilaration  more specifically ma mechanism of action is to stimulate the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft while preventing the reuptake of dopamine and norephinephrine  longlasting functional impairments in the monoamine system are likely to result from longterm abuse of ma  it is known that ma readily crosses the placenta that feeds the developing fetus yet the ways in which the drug affects the fetus are not fully understood  ma may exert its effects on the fetus directly by transfer through the placenta or indirectly by altering the fetal environment  ma has vasoconstrictive effects resulting in decreased uteroplacental blood flow elevated fetal blood pressure and fetal hypoxia  these effects often work together to result in prenatal strokes heart or other major organ damage in the developing fetus  these vasoconstrictive side effects can also have anorexic effects on the mother which can hinder intrauterine growth  studies done with pregnant rodents have found that prenatal ma exposure results in altered neural circuitry both structurally and functionally  these impairments can lead to later behavioral problems since the neural circuitry is responsible for maintaining functions such as arousal regulation and reactivity to stress  thus far only three areas of research have garnered a limited amount of information regarding the effects of prenatal ma use on developing children which include animals studies a minimal number of human studies that have many limitations and the recent cocaine literature  though in recent years conducted by pedro melo vincente zanon moreno sheila pons vazquez maria dolores pinazoduran maria amelia tavares for the institute of molecular and cell biology porto portugal researched rats who were exposed to ma use and its effects on the optic nerve myelination after prenatal exposure to this psychostimulant it is known that ma use effects sensory systems and the optic nerve according to the results of this study proved to be a target tissue it is often difficult to isolate psychostimulant use because often the abusers of these substances are polydrug users so animal studies are the closest thing to isolating the affects of just one psychostimulant the optic nerve is suitable structure to look at because it is a well studied structure and homogeneous between species at birth for most species the optic nerve is unmyelinated but that changes with adulthood and most of the nerve becomes myelinated in this study they gave doses of 5mgday from days 8 to 22 of pregnancy  the offspring were sacrificed at days 714 and 21 the treated ma group males had significantly smaller optic nerve diameter the optic nerve area pnd21 was significantly smaller than the unexposed control group the cross section at this area also was significantly smaller the final results concluded that there was an 80 increase in myelination on day 21 but only the female group this is consistent with rapid aging of the optic nerve due to ma exposure western blotting showed that postnatal days of 14 and 21 female group showed lower myelination basic protein level compared to the same control age group  though this study was conducted with the use of rats there is a high degree of similarity to rat and human anatomy so this can be comparable to effects on humans this cannot be confirmed though until ma exposed humans are studied postmortem these studies just as those of early prenatal cocaine exposure research have a number of methodological problems that include small sample size and confounding due to maternal use of a variety of drugs  yet ma use in utero is believed to affect the development of a babys brain spinal cord heart and kidney  studies have found shortterm symptoms to include prenatal complications such as premature delivery and birth deformities along with strokes and brain hemorrhages prior to birth  other investigations have revealed shortterm neonatal outcomes to include small deficits in infant neurobehavioral function and growth restriction when compared to control infants  also prenatal ma use is believed to have longterm effects in terms of brain development which may last for many years  a limited amount of research exists that focuses on the possible cognitive language motor emotional and behavioral functioning of young children prenatally exposed to methamphetamine  newborns prenatally exposed to ma often experience sleep disturbances and altered behavior problems since ma mimics neurotransmitters in the brain  oneyearold children prenatally exposed to ma have been shown to exhibit poorer fine motor performance which is associated with their visual perceptual and spatial skills  this has the possibility to hinder future visual perceptual processing thereby making it more difficult for these children to carry out coordinated movements such as bicycle riding and other physically demanding activities  a physician from iowa dr rizwan shah found that once babies exposed to methamphetamines prenatally hit about three to four weeks old they show signs of irritability that may last for years and eat poorly despite their need for nutrients and calories  once these babies become schoolaged children they are more likely to be hyperactive or to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd learning disabilities and unprovoked fits of anger  in order to gain insight into the longterm effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure a study undertaken in sweden carried out developmental assessments of children from birth to 14 years old who were born to mothers that abused ma during their pregnancy  they found that 8yearolds displayed aggressive behavior and social adjustment issues which were positively associated with the amount and duration of methamphetamine exposure in utero  by age 14 their language acquisition athletic abilities and mathematic skills were statistically lower than those of their classmates  however it is likely that psychosocial factors related to their environment such high numbers of foster care placements stress and overcrowded living conditions played a significant role in their behavioral and academic outcomes  mothers who continue to abuse methamphetaine after giving birth often expose their children to physical and family environments that are chaotic neglectful and abusive  in addition these women often report having less control over their children and see their children as being more aggressive  researchers believe these behavioral problems associated with prenatal drug exposure are intensified by the childrens high stress postnatal environments  other studies have found that children who remain in the care of addicted parents are more likely to display behavioral and emotional disturbances than those whose parents quit abusing the drug  ultimately more research needs to be conducted regarding the developmental outcomes for children prenatally exposed to ma since this area of research remains widely unknown  in addition it is unclear if the symptoms previously discovered are due to actual drug exposure in utero or to their home environment  media and social policy have contributed to an environment that stigmatizes pregnant substance abusers as shameful corrupt persons who are unfit to be mothers  unfortunately this stigmatization has also crossed over into research which is often influenced by biases assumptions and subjective judgments  much of the data that currently exists on prenatal meth exposure comes from unsubstantiated findings and poorly conducted studies that exaggerate the effects of illicit substance abuse  prenatal drug use by women in the united states came to the forefront of media and public health attention in the 1980s when cheap crack cocaine became widely available  the media portrayed pregnant crack abusers to be poor african americans and latinas who contributed to increased gang violence expanding underclass and an overwhelming number of crack babies  as a result these women often faced legal ramifications such as loss of parental rights to their children due to charges of neglect and abuse reduction in welfare benefits and imprisonment  although there was legitimate cause for concern as to the potential developmental and behavioral outcomes of children prenatally exposed to drugs the media created an image of these babies as damaged for life  however the evidence used to support the notion that crack babies were ultimately doomed came from methodologically compromised studies and anecdotal reports  methamphetamine is a highly addictive drug that can make users crave more as soon as the end of the last dose which makes it difficult for them to quit on their own in addition when meth users attempt to quit they often experience intense and uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety excessive eating and sleeping depression and intense cravings however it is possible for women to successfully treat their addiction during pregnancy with the most beneficial outcomes for the baby occurring when treatment begins in the first trimester  methamphetamine addiction treatment centers can help pregnant women safely detoxify with the use of medications that can eliminate withdrawal symptoms followed by psychiatric and obstetric evaluation and care  in addition many treatment programs offer individual and group counseling sessions to teach future mothers how to cope with stress without relapsing  raising awareness as to the extent of the meth abuse problem in combination with prevention techniques is a key way to address the developmental and behavioral needs of children prenatally exposed to meth  increased awareness involves proactive education by health professionals about the severity of the problem and fostering skills to recognize methamphetamine users these adjustments can allow for immediate intervention and possible protection of the unborn child  in addition there are other resources that are in place to raise awareness of the issue promote prevention and offer possible treatment options for example the state of montanas office of public instruction web site offers a methamphetamine prevention curriculum to middle school students while the ucla integrated substances abuse program sponsors a web site on the delivery of treatment services for methamphetamine  also a childrens hospital in rhode island established the vulnerable infants program to aid the court in making decisions regarding drugexposed infants possible placement in foster care and treatment options  the program also places an emphasis on trying to help families stay together when appropriate  this is an example of how collaborative effects can be made between the justice system and the health care community to ensure the wellbeing of children  15

V fetal alcohol spectrum disorders fasd are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy  problems may include an abnormal appearance short height low body weight small head poor coordination low intelligence behavior problems and problems with hearing or seeing  those affected more commonly have trouble in school have trouble with law enforcement are frequently jailed are involved in high risk sexual activity and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs  the most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome fas  other types include partial fetal alcohol syndrome pfas alcoholrelated neurodevelopmental disorder arnd and alcoholrelated birth defects arbd   fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy  surveys from the united states have found about 10 of pregnant women have drunk alcohol in the last month and 20 to 30 drank at some point during the pregnancy  about 47 of women who are pregnant have alcoholism  the risk of problems depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption as well as when during pregnancy the alcohol is consumed  other risk factors include an older mother smoking and poor diet  nonetheless there is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy   while drinking small amounts of alcohol do not cause abnormalities in the face it may cause behavioral issues  alcohol crosses the blood brain barrier and both directly and indirectly affects a developing baby  diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in the person  fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are preventable by avoiding alcohol  medical organizations recommend no alcohol during pregnancy for this reason    while the condition is permanent treatment can improve outcomes  interventions may include parentchild interaction therapy efforts to modify child behavior and possibly medications  fasd is estimated to affect between 2 and 5 of people in the united states and western europe  fas is believed to occur in between 02 and 9 per 1000 live births in the united states  in south africa some populations have rates as high as 9  the negative effects of alcohol have been described since ancient times  the lifetime cost per child with fas was 2000000 in 2002  the term fetal alcohol syndrome was first used in 1973    the key of fasd can vary between individuals exposed to alcohol during pregnancy while consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of fas minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cutoff criteria for other diagnoses across the fasd continuum the central nervous system cns damage criteria particularly lack clear consensus a working knowledge of the key features is helpful in understanding fasd diagnoses and conditions and each are reviewed with attention to similarities and differences across the four diagnostic systems in terms of fasd growth deficiency is defined as significantly below average height weight or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure and can be assessed at any point in the lifespan growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height gestational age for a premature infant and other postnatal insults eg poor nutrition although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements  deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the population  criteria for fasd are least specific in the iom diagnostic system low birth weight decelerating weight not due to nutrition or disproportional low weight to height p4 of executive summary  while the cdc and canadian guidelines use the 10th percentile as a cutoff to determine growth deficiency   the 4digit diagnostic code allows for midrange gradations in growth deficiency between the 3rd and 10th percentiles and severe growth deficiency at or below the 3rd percentile  growth deficiency at severe moderate or mild levels contributes to diagnoses of fas and pfas but not arnd or static encephalopathy growth deficiency is ranked as follows by the 4digit diagnostic code  in the initial studies that discovered fas growth deficiency was a requirement for inclusion in the studies thus all the original people with fas had growth deficiency as an artifact of sampling characteristics used to establish criteria for the syndrome  that is growth deficiency is a key feature of fasd because growth deficiency was a criterion for inclusion in the original study that determined the definition of fas this reinforces assertions that growth deficiency and fas facial features are less critical for understanding the disabilitys of fasd than the neurobehavioral sequelae to the brain damage  several characteristic craniofacial abnormalities are often visible in individuals with fas  the presence of fas facial features indicates brain damage though brain damage may also exist in their absence fas facial features and most other visible but nondiagnostic deformities are believed to be caused mainly during the 10th and 20th week of gestation  refinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features known to result from prenatal alcohol exposure and distinguishes fas from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics   the three fas facial features are measurement of fas facial features uses criteria developed by the university of washington the lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the lipphiltrum guide  a fivepoint likert scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal ranked 1 to severe ranked 5 palpebral fissure length pfl is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a pfl growth chart also developed by the university of washington  ranking fas facial features is complicated because the three separate facial features can be affected independently by prenatal alcohol a summary of the criteria follows   central nervous system cns damage is the primary key feature of any fasd diagnosis prenatal alcohol exposure which is classified as a teratogen can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments depending on the amount timing and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother   while functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the fasd disability cns damage can be assessed in three areas structural neurological and functional impairments all four diagnostic systems allow for assessment of cns damage in these areas but criteria vary the iom system requires structural or neurological impairment for a diagnosis of fas but also allows a complex pattern of functional anomalies for diagnosing pfas and arnd  the 4digit diagnostic code and cdc guidelines allow for a positive cns finding in any of the three areas for any fasd diagnosis but functional anomalies must measure at two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains for a diagnoses of fas pfas and arnd   the 4digit diagnostic code also allows for an fasd diagnosis when only two functional domains are measured at two standard deviations or worse  the 4digit diagnostic code further elaborates the degree of cns damage according to four ranks structural abnormalities of the brain are observable physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure structural impairments may include microcephaly small head size of two or more standard deviations below the average or other abnormalities in brain structure eg agenesis of the corpus callosum cerebellar hypoplasia  microcephaly is determined by comparing head circumference often called occipitofrontal circumference or ofc to appropriate ofc growth charts  other structural impairments must be observed through medical imaging techniques by a trained physician because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most people diagnosis of fas is not frequently made via structural impairments except for microcephaly evidence of a cns structural impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of fas and neurological and functional impairments are highly likely     during the first trimester of pregnancy alcohol interferes with the migration and organization of brain cells which can create structural deformities or deficits within the brain  during the third trimester damage can be caused to the hippocampus which plays a role in memory learning emotion and encoding visual and auditory information all of which can create neurological and functional cns impairments as well  as of 2002 there were 25 reports of autopsies on infants known to have fas the first was in 1973 on an infant who died shortly after birth  the examination revealed extensive brain damage including microcephaly migration anomalies callosal dysgenesis and a massive neuroglial leptomeningeal heterotopia covering the left hemisphere  in 1977 dr clarren described a second infant whose mother was a binge drinker the infant died ten days after birth the autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus abnormal neuronal migration and a small corpus callosum which connects the two brain hemispheres and cerebellum  fas has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes agenesis of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure neuronal migration errors absent olfactory bulbs meningomyelocele and porencephaly  when structural impairments are not observable or do not exist neurological impairments are assessed in the context of fasd neurological impairments are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the central nervous system cns the peripheral nervous system or the autonomic nervous system a determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician and must not be due to a postnatal insult such as a high fever concussion traumatic brain injury etc all four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for cns damage at the neurological level and evidence of a cns neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of fas or pfas and functional impairments are highly likely     neurological problems are expressed as either hard signs or diagnosable disorders such as epilepsy or other seizure disorders or soft signs soft signs are broader nonspecific neurological impairments or symptoms such as impaired fine motor skills neurosensory hearing loss poor gait clumsiness poor eyehand coordination many soft signs have normreferenced criteria while others are determined through clinical judgment clinical judgment is only as good as the clinician and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist a pediatric neuropsychologist or both those affected have mild retardation when structural or neurological impairments are not observed all four diagnostic systems allow cns damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments     functional impairments are deficits problems delays or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning often referred to as developmental disabilities there is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure  and only cdc guidelines label developmental delays as such  so criteria and fasd diagnoses vary somewhat across diagnostic systems the four diagnostic systems list various cns domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an fasd diagnosis other conditions may commonly cooccur with fas stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure however these conditions are considered alcoholrelated birth defects  and not diagnostic criteria for fas fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four standard drinks per day  milder symptoms have been found with two drinks per day during the early part of pregnancy   among those who are alcoholic about a third of children have fas  evidence of harm from less than two drinks per day or 10 drinks per week is not clear   while small amounts of alcohol do not cause an abnormal appearance it may cause behavioral issues  there is conflicting evidence regarding whether drinking by fathers before conception can cause fas  despite intense research efforts it has not been possible to identify a single clearcut mechanism for development of fas or fasd on the contrary clinical and animal studies have identified a broad spectrum of pathways through which maternal alcohol can negatively affect the outcome of a pregnancy clear conclusions with universal validity are difficult to draw since different ethnic groups show considerable genetic polymorphism for the hepatic enzymes responsible for ethanol detoxification  genetic examinations have revealed a continuum of longlasting molecular effects that are not only timing specific but are also dosage specific with even moderate amounts being able to cause alterations  a human fetus appears to be at triple risk from maternal alcohol consumption   generally fetal tissues have far less antioxidant protection than adult tissues as they express no significant quantities adh or aldh and far less antioxidant enzymes like sod glutathion transferases or glutathion peroxidases  because admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can stigmatize birth mothers many are reluctant to admit drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank this complicates diagnosis and treatment   of the syndrome as a result diagnosis of the severity of fasd relies on protocols of observation of the childs physiology and behavior rather than maternal selfreporting presently four fasd diagnostic systems that diagnose fas and other fasd conditions have been developed in north america each diagnostic system requires that a complete fasd evaluation includes an assessment of the four key features of fasd described below a positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of fas however prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of fasd and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an fasd diagnosis that is not fullblown fas while the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome fas there are still differences when full criteria for fas are not met this has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of fasd which may account for such a wide variety of terminology most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of fas and fall into other fasd conditions  the canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the 4digit diagnostic code for each key feature of fasd and the terminology of the iom in diagnostic categories excepting arbd  thus other fasd conditions are partial expressions of fas however these other fasd conditions may create disabilities similar to fas if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of ten domains of brain functioning essentially even though growth deficiency andor fas facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other fasd conditions yet clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present in these other fasd conditions an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the fas face that might ordinarily trigger an fasd evaluation such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary mental health disorders such as adhd or oppositional defiance disorder without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders while other fasd conditions may not yet be included as an icd or dsmivtr diagnosis they nonetheless pose significant impairment in functional behavior because of underlying brain damage the following criteria must be fully met for an fas diagnosis     fetal alcohol syndrome fas is the first diagnosable condition of fasd that was discovered fas is the only expression of fasd that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official icd9 and icd10 diagnosis to make this diagnosis or determine any fasd condition a multidisciplinary evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment generally a trained physician will determine growth deficiency and fas facial features while a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities andor neurological problems usually central nervous system damage is determined through psychological speechlanguage and occupational therapy assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the ten brain domains  prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician psychologist social worker or chemical health counselor these professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative multidisciplinary report to diagnose fas or other fasd conditions in an individual partial fas pfas previously known as atypical fas in the 1997 edition of the 4digit diagnostic code people with pfas have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata central nervous system damage is present at the same level as fas these individuals have the same functional disabilities but look less like fas the following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of partial fas    fetal alcohol effects fae is a previous term for alcoholrelated neurodevelopmental disorder and alcoholrelated birth defects  it was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure or unknown exposure for humans but without obvious physical anomalies  smith 1981 described fae as an extremely important concept to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage regardless of the growth or facial features  this term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than fas when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental  alcoholrelated neurodevelopmental disorder arnd was initially suggested by the institute of medicine to replace the term fae and focus on central nervous system damage rather than growth deficiency or fas facial features the canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria while the 4digit diagnostic code includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories it refers to this condition as static encephalopathy the behavioral effects of arnd are not necessarily unique to alcohol however so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure  arnd may be gaining acceptance over the terms fae and arbd to describe fasd conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or fas facial features   the following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of arnd or static encephalopathy    alcoholrelated birth defects arbd formerly known as possible fetal alcohol effect pfae  was a term proposed as an alternative to fae and pfae  the iom presents arbd as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of fasd  pfae and arbd have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of fasd  the canadian guidelines recommend that arbd should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for fasd prenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mothers alcohol use during the pregnancy if available prenatal health records if available and review of available birth records court records if applicable chemical dependency treatment records if applicable or other reliable sources exposure level is assessed as confirmed exposure unknown exposure and confirmed absence of exposure by the iom cdc and canadian diagnostic systems the 4digit diagnostic code further distinguishes confirmed exposure as high risk and some risk amount frequency and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of fasd while consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic  the cdc guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically the iom and canadian guidelines explore this further acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining but offer no standard for diagnosis canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that heavy alcohol use is defined by the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30day period  the 4digit diagnostic code ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as high risk and some risk it operationalizes high risk exposure as a blood alcohol concentration bac greater than 100mgdl delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy this bac level is typically reached by a 55kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting  for many adopted or adults and children in foster care records or other reliable sources may not be available for review reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers especially if alcohol use is ongoing  in these cases all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation a diagnosis of fas is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of fasd are present at clinical levels confirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy this designation is relatively rare as most people presenting for an fasd evaluation are at least suspected to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of fasd   a recent effort to standardize assessment of functional cns damage has been suggested by an experienced fasd diagnostic team in minnesota the proposed framework attempts to harmonize iom 4digit diagnostic code cdc and canadian guidelines for measuring cns damage visàvis fasd evaluations and diagnosis the standardized approach is referred to as the ten brain domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems recommendations for assessing cns damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure the framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of fasd with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities  the proposed ten brain domains include  the fetal alcohol diagnostic program fadp uses unpublished minnesota state criteria of performance at 15 or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the ten brain domains to determine cns damage however the ten brain domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems cns damage criteria as the framework only proposes the domains rather than the cutoff criteria for fasd  the cdc reviewed nine syndromes that have overlapping features with fas however none of these syndromes include all three fas facial features and none are the result of prenatal alcohol exposure  the only certain way to prevent fas is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy  in the united states the surgeon general recommended in 1981 and again in 2005 that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages even weeks of a pregnancy as the woman may not be aware that she has conceived  in the united states federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the alcoholic beverage labeling act there is some controversy surrounding the zerotolerance approach taken by many countries when it comes to alcohol consumption during pregnancy the assertion that moderate drinking causes fas is said to lack strong evidence and in fact the practice of equating a responsible level of drinking with potential harm to the fetus may have negative social legal and health impacts  in addition special care should be taken when considering statistics on this disease as prevalence and causation is often linked with fasd which is more common and causes less harm as opposed to fas  there is no cure for fasd but treatment is possible because cns damage symptoms secondary disabilities and needs vary widely by individual there is no one treatment type that works for everyone psychoactive drugs are frequently tried on those with fasd as many fasd symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders most notably adhd  behavioral interventions are based on the learning theory which is the basis for many parenting and professional strategies and interventions  along with ordinary parenting styles such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with fas as the diagnoses oppositional defiance disorder odd conduct disorder reactive attachment disorder rad often overlap with fas along with adhd and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions frequently a persons poor academic achievement results in special education services which also utilizes principles of learning theory behavior modification and outcomebased education many books and handouts on fas recommend a developmental approach based on developmental psychology even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages eg jean piagets theory of cognitive development erik eriksons stages of psychosocial development john bowlbys attachment framework and other developmental stage theories fas interferes with normal development  which may cause stages to be delayed skipped or immaturely developed over time an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally but not so for a child with fas  by knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow treatment and interventions for fas can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully  if a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain for instance then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice eg practiced instruction on tying shoelaces giving reminders or making accommodations eg using slipon shoes to support the desired functioning level this approach is an advance over behavioral interventions because it takes the persons developmental context into account while developing interventions  the advocacy model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with fas  advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate for example a family member friend or case manager and fall into three basic categories an advocate for fas 1 interprets fas and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates 2 engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person and 3 assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals  the advocacy model is often recommended for example when developing an individualized education program iep for the persons progress at school  an understanding of the developmental framework would presumably inform and enhance the advocacy model but advocacy also implies interventions at a systems level as well such as educating schools social workers and so forth on best practices for fas however several organizations devoted to fas also use the advocacy model at a community practice level as well  treating fas at the public health and public policy level promotes fas prevention and diversion of public resources to assist those with fas  it is related to the advocacy model but promoted at a systems level rather than with the individual or family such as developing community education and supports state or province level prevention efforts eg screening for maternal alcohol use during obgyn or prenatal medical care visits or national awareness programs several organizations and state agencies in the us are dedicated to this type of intervention  the primary disabilities of fas are the functional difficulties with which the child is born as a result of cns damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure  often primary disabilities are mistaken as behavior problems but the underlying cns damage is the originating source of a functional difficulty  rather than a mental health condition which is considered a secondary disability the exact mechanisms for functional problems of primary disabilities are not always fully understood but animal studies have begun to shed light on some correlates between functional problems and brain structures damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure  representative examples include functional difficulties may result from cns damage in more than one domain but common functional difficulties by domain include     note that this is not an exhaustive list of difficulties the secondary disabilities of fas are those that arise later in life secondary to cns damage these disabilities often emerge over time due to a mismatch between the primary disabilities and environmental expectations secondary disabilities can be ameliorated with early interventions and appropriate supportive services  six main secondary disabilities were identified in a university of washington research study of 473 subjects diagnosed with fas pfas partial fetal alcohol syndrome and arnd alcoholrelated neurodevelopmental disorder   two additional secondary disabilities exist for adults   eight factors were identified in the same study as universal protective factors that reduced the incidence rate of the secondary disabilities   malbin 2002 has identified the following areas of interests and talents as strengths that often stand out for those with fasd and should be utilized like any strength in treatment planning  fasd is estimated to affect between 2 and 5 of people in the united states and western europe  fas is believed to occur in between 02 and 9 per 1000 live births in the united states  the lifetime cost of an individual with fas were estimated to be two million usd in 2002  fasd among australian youth is more common in indigenous australians  the only states that have registered birth defects in australian youth are western australia new south wales victoria and south australia  in australia only 12 of australian health professionals are aware of the diagnostics and symptoms of fasd  in western australia the rate of births resulting in fasd is 002 per 1000 births for nonindigenous australians however among indigenous births the rate is 276 per 1000 births  in victoria there have been no registered fasd related births for indigenous australians but the rate for the general population in victoria is 001003 per 1000 births  there have been no dedicated fasd clinics within western australia but there are also no nationally supported diagnostic criteria anywhere in australia  passive surveillance is a prevention technique used within australia to assist in monitoring and establishing detectable defects during pregnancy and childhood  anecdotal accounts of prohibitions against maternal alcohol use from biblical ancient greek and ancient roman sources imply a historical awareness of links between maternal alcohol use and negative child outcomes  in gaelic scotland the mother and nurse were not allowed to consume ale during pregnancy and breastfeeding martin martin the earliest recorded observation of possible links between maternal alcohol use and fetal damage was made in 1899 by dr william sullivan a liverpool prison physician who noted higher rates of stillbirth for 120 alcoholic female prisoners than their sober female relatives he suggested the causal agent to be alcohol use  this contradicted the predominating belief at the time that heredity caused intellectual disability poverty and criminal behavior which contemporary studies on the subjects usually concluded  a case study by henry h goddard of the kallikak familypopular in the early 1900srepresents this earlier perspective  though later researchers have suggested that the kallikaks almost certainly had fas  general studies and discussions on alcoholism throughout the mid1900s were typically based on a heredity argument  prior to fetal alcohol syndrome being specifically identified and named in 1973 a few studies had noted differences between the children of mothers who used alcohol during pregnancy or breastfeeding and those who did not but identified alcohol use as a possible contributing factor rather than heredity  fetal alcohol syndrome was named in 1973 by two dysmorphologists drs kenneth lyons jones and david weyhe smith of the university of washington medical school in seattle united states they identified a pattern of craniofacial limb and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal onset growth deficiency and developmental delay in eight unrelated children of three ethnic groups all born to mothers who were alcoholics  the pattern of malformations indicated that the damage was prenatal news of the discovery shocked some while others were skeptical of the findings  dr paul lemoine of nantes france had already published a study in a french medical journal in 1968 about children with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics  and in the us christy ulleland and colleagues at the university of washington medical school had conducted an 18month study in 19681969 documenting the risk of maternal alcohol consumption among the offspring of 11 alcoholic mothers  the washington and nantes findings were confirmed by a research group in gothenburg sweden in 1979  researchers in france sweden and the united states were struck by how similar these children looked though they were not related and how they behaved in the same unfocused and hyperactive manner  within nine years of the washington discovery animal studies including nonhuman monkey studies carried out at the university of washington primate center by dr sterling clarren had confirmed that alcohol was a teratogen by 1978 245 cases of fas had been reported by medical researchers and the syndrome began to be described as the most frequent known cause of intellectual disability while many syndromes are eponymous ie named after the physician first reporting the association of symptoms dr smith named fas after the causal agent of the symptoms  he reasoned that doing so would encourage prevention believing that if people knew maternal alcohol consumption caused the syndrome then abstinence during pregnancy would follow from patient education and public awareness  at the time nobody was aware of the full range of possible birth defects from fas or its rate of prevalence  over time as subsequent research and clinical experience suggested that a range of effects including physical behavioral and cognitive could arise from prenatal alcohol exposure the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder fasd was developed to include fas as well as other conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure  currently fas    is the only expression of prenatal alcohol exposure defined by the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems and assigned icd9 and diagnoses fetal alcohol spectrum disorder at dmoz

V amniotic band constriction also known as amniotic band syndrome adam complex amniotic band sequence congenital constriction bands and pseudoainhum  is a congenital disorder caused by entrapment of fetal parts usually a limb or digits in fibrous amniotic bands while in utero   the constriction of appendages by amniotic bands may result in a strong relationship between abs and clubfoot also called talipes exists a 315 of associated clubfoot deformity and abs can be correlated with 20 occurring bilaterally other abnormalities found with abs include clubhands cleft lip andor cleft palate and hemangioma decreased fetal movement could be a sign of a serious problem which may include abs it is rare but possible for the membrane to become wrapped around the placenta or the neck of the baby in the womb causing strangulation and death to explain the cause of abs there are two main theories the amniotic band theory is that abs occurs due to a partial rupture of the amniotic sac this rupture involves only the amnion the chorion remains intact fibrous bands of the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can encircle and trap some part of the fetus later as the fetus grows but the bands do not the bands become constricting this constriction reduces blood circulation hence causes congenital abnormalities in some cases a complete natural amputation of a digits or limb may occur before birth or the digits or limbs may be necrotic dead and require surgical amputation following birth the vascular disruption theory because the constricting mechanism of the amniotic band theory does not explain the high incidence of cleft palate and other forms of cleft defects occurring together with abs this cooccurrence suggests an intrinsic defect of the blood circulation amniotic band syndrome is often difficult to detect before birth as the individual strands are small and hard to see on ultrasound often the bands are detected indirectly because of the constrictions and swelling upon limbs digits etc misdiagnosis is also common so if there are any signs of amniotic bands further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity 3d ultrasound and mri can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damagedanger to the fetus in rare cases if diagnosed in utero fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation or other deformity this typically would not be attempted if neither vital organs nor the umbilical cord were affected this operation has been successfully performed on fetuses as young as 22 weeks  the surgery took place at melbournes monash medical centre in australia and is believed to be the earliest surgery of its type as surgeons usually hold off on operating until the woman is in week 28 of gestation  there are also several facilities in the united states that have performed successful amniotic band release surgery treatment usually occurs after birth and where plastic and reconstructive surgery is considered to treat the resulting deformity  plastic surgery ranges from simple to complex depending on the extent of the deformity physical and occupational therapy may be needed long term prosthetics may help some abs sufferers to live more functional lives the price and complexity of these prosthetics vary dramatically but advances in 3d printing have helped to increase the availability of artificial fingers while reducing their cost of production  the prognosis depends on the location and severity of the constricting bands every case is different and multiple bands may be entangled around the fetus bands which wrap around fingers and toes can result in syndactyly or amputations of the digits in other instances bands can wrap around limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet in more severe cases the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation amniotic bands can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate if the bands become wrapped around the head or umbilical cord it can be lifethreatening for the fetus the number of cases of miscarriage that can be attributed to abs is unknown although it has been reported that it may be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages amniotic band syndrome is considered an accidental event and it does not appear to be genetic or hereditary so the likelihood of it occurring in another pregnancy is remote the cause of amnion tearing is unknown and as such there are no known preventative measures amniotic banding affects approximately 1 in 1200 live births it is also believed to be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages up to 50 of cases have other congenital anomalies including cleft lip cleft palate and clubfoot deformity hand and finger anomalies occur in up to 80 among the more notable people living with abs are

V trimethylaminuria tmau as defined by the kim consortium of endocrinology disorders as fish odor syndrome or fish malodor syndrome  is a rare metabolic disorder that causes a defect in the normal production of an enzyme named flavincontaining monooxygenase 3 fmo3   when fmo3 is not working correctly or if not enough enzyme is produced the body loses the ability to properly convert trimethylamine tma from precursor compounds in food digestion into trimethylamine oxide tmao through a process called noxygenation trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the persons sweat urine and breath giving off a strong fishy odor or strong body odor a variant of tmau secondary tmau or tmau2 exists where there is no genetic cause yet excessive tma is secreted possibly due to intestinal dysbiosis altered metabolism or hormonal reasons    the first clinical case of tmau was described in 1970  trimethylamine builds up in the body of patients with trimethylaminuria the trimethylamine is released in the persons sweat urine reproductive fluids and breath giving off a strong fishy or body odor some people with trimethylaminuria have a strong odor all the time but most have a moderate smell that varies in intensity over time individuals with this condition do not have any physical symptoms and typically appear healthy  the condition seems to be more common in women than men for unknown reasons scientists suspect that female sex hormones such as progesterone and estrogen aggravate symptoms there are several reports that the condition worsens around puberty in women symptoms can worsen just before and during menstrual periods after taking oral contraceptives and around menopause  this odor varies depending on many known factors including diet hormonal changes stress level amount of sweat other odors in the space and individual sense of smell measurement of urine for the ratio of trimethylamine to trimethylamine oxide is the standard screening test a blood test is available to provide genetic analysis the prominent enzyme responsible for tma noxygenation is coded by the fmo3 gene false positives can occur in the following conditions where elevated tma can be present in the urine without any underlying tmau there is no known cure or treatment for the disorder people affected by the disorder live relatively normal lives by managing their symptoms and with counseling when the condition is suspected or known to occur in a family genetic testing can be helpful in identifying the specific individuals who have or carry the disorder ways of reducing the fishy odor may include additionally at least one study  has suggested that daily intake of the supplements activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin may improve the quality of life of individuals afflicted with tmau by helping their bodies to oxidize and convert tma to the odorless noxide tmao metabolite study participants experienced subjective reduction in odor as well as objective reduction in tma and increase in tmao concentration measured in their urine the study found that most cases of trimethylaminuria appear to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene carriers may have mild symptoms of trimethylaminuria or experience temporary episodes of fishlike body odor mutations in the fmo3 gene which is found on the long arm of chromosome 1 cause trimethylaminuria the fmo3 gene makes an enzyme that breaks down nitrogencontaining compounds from the diet including trimethylamine these compounds are produced by bacteria in the intestine as they digest proteins from eggs meat soy and other foods normally the fmo3 enzyme converts fishysmelling trimethylamine into trimethylamine noxide which has no odor if the enzyme is missing or its activity is reduced because of a mutation in the fmo3 gene trimethylamine is not broken down and instead builds up in the body as the compound is released in a persons sweat urine and breath it causes the strong odor characteristic of trimethylaminuria researchers believe that stress and diet also play a role in triggering symptoms there are more than 40 known mutations associated with tmau   lossoffunction mutations nonsense mutations and missense mutations are three of the most common nonsense and missense mutations cause the most severe phenotypes although fmo3 mutations account for most known cases of trimethylaminuria some cases are caused by other factors a fishlike body odor could result from an excess of certain proteins in the diet or from an increase in bacteria in the digestive system a few cases of the disorder have been identified in adults with liver damage caused by hepatitis in 2007 the evolution of the fmo3 gene was studied including the evolution of some mutations associated with tmau  this

V proximal femoral focal deficiency pffd also known as congenital femoral deficiency cfd  is a rare nonhereditary birth defect that affects the pelvis particularly the hip bone and the proximal femur the disorder may affect one side or both with the hip being deformed and the leg shortened it is commonly linked with the absence or shortening of a leg bone fibular hemimelia and the absence of a kneecap other linked birth defects include the dislocation or instability of the joint between the femur and the kneecap a shortened tibia or fibula and foot deformities   there are typically four classes or types of pffd ranging from class a to class d as detailed by aitken  the cause of pffd is uncertain two hypotheses have been advanced the theory of sclerotome subtraction posits injury to neural crest cells that are the precursors to sensory nerves at the level of l4 and l5  histologic studies of a fetus with unilateral pffd have prompted an alternative hypothesis that pffd is caused by a defect in maturation of chondrocytes cartilage cells at the growth plate  in either hypothesis the agent causing the injury is usually not known thalidomide is known to cause pffd when the mother is exposed to it in the fifth or sixth week of pregnancy and it is speculated that exposure to other toxins during pregnancy may also be a cause other etiologies that have been suggested but not proven include anoxia ischemia radiation infection hormones and mechanical force pffd occurs sporadically and does not appear to be hereditary  depending on the severity of the deformities the treatment may include the amputation of the foot or part of the leg lengthening of the femur extension prosthesis or custom shoe lifts amputation usually requires the use of prosthesis another alternative is a rotation prosthesis  in less severe cases the use of an ilizarov apparatus can be successful in conjunction with hip and knee surgeries depending on the status of the femoral headkneecap to extend the femur length to normal ranges this method of treatment can be problematic in that the ilizarov might need to be applied both during early childhood to keep the femur from being extremely short at the onset of growth and after puberty to match leg lengths after growth has ended the clear benefit of this approach however is that no prosthetics are needed and at the conclusion of surgical procedures the patient will not be biologically or anatomically different from a person born without pffd

V arthrogryposis multiplex congenita amc or simply arthrogryposis describes congenital joint contractures in two or more areas of the body it derives its name from greek literally meaning curving of joints arthron joint gr\u0233p\u014dsis late latin form of late greek gr\u016bp\u014dsis hooking  children born with one or more joint contractures have abnormal fibrosis of the muscle tissue causing muscle shortening and therefore are unable to perform passive extension and flexion in the affected joint or joints  amc has been divided into three groups amyoplasia distal arthrogryposis and syndromic amyoplasia is characterized by severe joint contractures and muscle weakness  distal arthrogryposis mainly involves the hands and feet types of arthrogryposis with a primary neurological or muscle disease belong to the syndromic group    almost every joint in a patient with arthrogryposis is often affected in 84 all limbs are involved in 11 only the legs and in 4 only the arms are involved  every joint in the body has typical signs and symptoms like the shoulder internal rotation wrist volar and ulnar hand fingers in fixed flexion and thumb in palm hip flexed abducted and externally rotated frequently dislocated elbow extension and pronation and foot clubfoot  the range of motion capability can be different between joints because of the different deviations  some types of arthrogryposis like amyoplasia have a symmetrical jointlimb involvement with normal sensations   the contractures in the joints are sometimes resulting in a reduced walking development in the first 5 years  the intelligence is normal to above normal in children with amyoplasia  but it is unknown how many of these children have an above normal intelligence and there is no literature available about the cause of this syndrome there are a few syndromes like the freemansheldon and gordon syndrome which have craniofacial involvement  the amyoplasia form of arthrogryposis is sometimes accompanied with a midline facial hemangioma  arthrogryposis is not a diagnosis but a clinical finding so this disease is often accompanied with other syndromes or diseases these other diagnoses can be found in every single organ in a patient there are a few slightly more common diagnoses such as pulmonary hypoplasia cryptorchidism congenital heart defects tracheoesophageal fistulas inguinal hernias cleft palate and eye abnormalities  research of arthrogryposis has shown that anything that inhibits normal joint movement before birth can result in joint contractures  arthrogryposis could be caused by genetic and environmental factors in principle any factor that curtails fetal movement can result to congenital contractures  the exact causes of arthrogryposis are unknown yet the malformations of arthrogryposis can be secondary to environmental factors such as decreased intrauterine movement oligohydramnios low volume or abnormal distribution of intrauterine fluid and defects in the fetal blood supply other causes could be hyperthermia limb immobilization and viral infections myasthenia gravis of the mother leads also in rare cases to arthrogryposis the major cause in humans is fetal akinesia  however this is disputed lately  arthrogryposis could also be caused by intrinsic factors this includes molecular muscle and connective tissue development disorders or neurological abnormalities research has shown that there are more than 35 specific genetic disorders associated with arthrogryposis most of those mutations are missense which means the mutation results in a different amino acid other mutations that could cause arthrogryposis are single gene defects xlinked recessive autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant mitochondrial defects and chromosomal disorders for example trisomy 18  this is mostly seen in distal arthrogryposis mutations in at least five genes tnn12 tnnt3 tpm2 myh3 and myh8 could cause distal arthrogryposis  there could be also connective tissue neurological of muscle development disorders  loss of muscle mass with an imbalance of muscle power at the joint can lead to connective tissue abnormality  this leads to joint fixation and reduced fetal movement  also muscle abnormalities could lead to a reduction of fetal movement those could be dystrophy myopathy and mitochondrial disorders this is mostly the result of abnormal function of the dystrophinglycoproteinassociated complex in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscles  7080 of the cases of arthrogryposis are caused by neurological abnormalities most of these result from an underlying genetic syndrome or are due to environmental factors  the underlying aetiology and pathogenesis of congenital contractures particularly arthrogryposis and the mechanism of the mutations remains an active area of investigation because identifying these factors could help to develop treatment and congenital finding of arthrogryposis   there is currently a lot of research on prenatal diagnosis the diagnosis can be made prenatally in approximately 50 of fetuses presenting arthrogryposis  it could be found during routine ultrasound scanning showing a lack of mobility and abnormal position of the foetus  nowadays there are more options for visualization of details and structures can be seen well like the use of 4d ultrasound  in clinic a child can be diagnosed with arthrogryposis with physical examination confirmed by ultrasound mri   or muscle biopsy  some of the different types of amc include the treatment of arthrogryposis includes occupational therapy physical therapy splinting and surgery  the primary longterm goals of these treatments are increasing joint mobility muscle strength and the development of adaptive use patterns that allow for walking and independence with activities of daily living since arthrogryposis includes many different types the treatment varies between patients depending on the symptoms  only a few good articles exist in which a surgical technique that is used to treat arthrogryposis is described these surgeries are explained below children with the amyoplasia type of arthrogryposis usually have flexed and ulnarly deviated wrists  dorsal carpal wedge osteotomy is indicated for wrists with excessive flexion contracture deformity when nonsurgical interventions such as occupational therapy and splinting have failed to improve function on the dorsal side at the level of the midcarpus a wedge osteotomy is made sufficient bone is resected to at least be able to put the wrist in a neutral position if the wrist is also ulnarly deviated more bone can be taken from the radial side to correct this abnormality this position is held into place with two cross kwires in addition a tendon transfer of the extensor carpi ulnaris to the extensor carpi radialis brevis may be performed to correct ulnar deviation or wrist extension weakness or both this tendon transfer is only used if the extensor carpi ulnaris appears to be functional enough  the soft tissue envelope in congenital contractual conditions such as clasped or arthrogrypotic thumbs is often deficient in two planes the thumbindex web and the flexor aspect of the thumb there is often an appearance of increased skin at the base of the index finger that is part of the deformity this tissue can be used to resurface the thumbindex web after a comprehensive release of all the tight structures to allow for a larger range of motion of the thumb this technique is called the index rotation flap the flap is taken from the radial side of the index finger it is proximally based at the distal edge of the thumbindex web the flap is made as wide as possible but still small enough to close with the excessive skin on the palmar side of the index finger the flap is rotated around the tightest part of the thumb to the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb allowing for a larger range of motion  many other surgeries are also able to improve function in joints of arthrogryposis patients these surgeries usually exist out of tendon transfers and skin flap movements adjusted to the individual there is still little literature available about the prognosis of patient with arthrogryposis the search for a prognostic factor is difficult because of the small number of patients but there are a few factors that seem to have an influence on the prognosis like the progressive muscle activity improvement results of a study showed an increase in strength during growth after the recovery of a passive range of motion in a useful arc  other positive prognostic factors for independent walking were active hips and knees hip flexion contractures of less than 20 degrees and knee flexion contractures less than 15 degrees without severe scoliosis  arthrogryposis is a rare condition some authors say the overall prevalence is one in 3000  and others say it is one in 1100012000 among european live births  congenital clubfoot is the most common single contracture and its prevalence is one in 500 live births

V the development of analogs of thalidomide was precipitated by the discovery of the antiangiogenic and antiinflammatory properties of the drug yielding a new way of fighting cancer as well as some inflammatory diseases after it had been banned in 1961 the problems with thalidomide included teratogenic side effects high incidence of other adverse reactions poor solubility in water and poor absorption from the intestines in 1998 thalidomide was approved by the us food and drug administration fda for use in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma mm under strict regulations  this has led to the development of a number of analogs with fewer side effects and increased potency which include lenalidomide currently marketed pomalidomide and apremilast currently marketed all of which are manufactured by celgene   thalidomide was originally released in the federal republic of germany west germany under the label of contergan on october 1 1957 by chemie grünenthal now grünenthal the drug was primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic but it was also used as an antiemetic and sedative the drug was banned in 1961 after its teratogenic properties were observed the problems with thalidomide were aside from the teratogenic side effects both high incidence of other adverse reactions along with poor solubility in water and absorption from the intestines   adverse reactions include peripheral neuropathy in large majority of patients constipation thromboembolism along with dermatological complications  four years after thalidomide was withdrawn from the market for its ability to induce severe birth defects its antiinflammatory properties were discovered when patients suffering from erythema nodosum leprosumenl used thalidomide as a sedative and it reduced both the clinical signs and symptoms of the disease thalidomide was discovered to inhibit tumour necrosis factoralpha tnf\u03b1 in 1991 tnf\u03b1 is a cytokine produced by macrophages of the immune system and also a mediator of inflammatory response thus the drug is effective against some inflammatory diseases such as enl in 1994 thalidomide was found to have antiangiogenic activity  and antitumor activity  which propelled the initiation of clinical trials for cancer including multiple myeloma the discovery of the antiinflammatory antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of thalidomide increased the interest of further research and synthesis of safer analogs   lenalidomide is the first analog of thalidomide which is marketed it is considerably more potent than its parent drug with only two differences at a molecular level with an added amino group at position 4 of the phthaloyl ring and removal of a carbonyl group from the phthaloyl ring  development of lenalidomide began in the late 1990s and clinical trials of lenalidomide began in 2000 in october 2001 lenalidomide was granted orphan status for the treatment of mm in mid2002 it entered phase ii and by early 2003 phase iii in february 2003 fda granted fasttrack status to lenalidomide for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mm  in 2006 it was approved for the treatment of mm along with dexamethasone and in 2007 by european medicines agency ema in 2008 phase ii trial observed efficacy in treating nonhodgkins lymphoma  pomalidomide 3aminothalidomide was the second thalidomide analog to enter the clinic being more potent than both of its predecessors  first reported in 2001 pomalidomide was noted to directly inhibit myeloma cell proliferation and thus inhibiting mm both on the tumor and vascular compartments  this dual activity of pomalidomide makes it more efficacious than thalidomide in vitro and in vivo  this effect is not related to tnf alpha inhibition since potent tnf alpha inhibitors such as rolipram and pentoxifylline did not inhibit myeloma cell growth nor angiogenesis  up regulation of interferon gamma il2 and il10 have been reported for pomalidomide and may contribute to its antiangiogenic and antimyeloma activities 05  4 hours in subjects with mm   median 2 hours in patients with severeplaque type psorasis  demethylated apremilast along with hydrolyzed products  thalidomide and its analogs lenalidomide and pomalidomide are believed to act in a similar fashion even though their exact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood it is believed that they work through different mechanisms in various diseases the net effect is probably due to different mechanisms combined apremilast is however believed to work through a different mechanism and therefore will be discussed separately mechanism of action will be explained in light of todays knowledge mainly in mm figure 2 thalidomide and its immunemodulating analogs alter the production of the inflammatory cytokines tnf\u03b1 il1 il6 il12 and antiinflammatory cytokine il10  the analogs are believed to inhibit the production of tnf\u03b1 where the analogs are up to 50000 times more potent in vitro than the parent drug thalidomide  the mechanism is believed to be through enhanced degradation of tnf\u03b1 mrna resulting in diminished amounts of this proinflammatory cytokine secreted  this explains the effect of thalidomide when given to enl patients as they commonly have high levels of tnf\u03b1 in their blood and in dermatological lesions  in contrast in vitro assay demonstrated that tnf\u03b1 is actually enhanced in tcell activation where cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes were stimulated by anticd3   which was later confirmed in an early phase trials involving solid tumors and inflammatory dermatologic diseases  il12 is another cytokine both suppressed and enhanced by thalidomide and its analogs when monocytes are stimulated by lipopolysaccharides il12 production is suppressed but during tcell stimulation the production is enhanced  lenalidomide is believed to be about 1000 times more potent in vitro than thalidomide in antiinflammatory properties and pomalidomide about 10 times more potent than lenalidomide it is worth noticing however that when comparing lenalidomide and pomalidomide clinical relevance of higher in vitro potency is unclear since maximum tolerated dose of pomalidomide is 2mg daily compared to 25mg for lenalidomide leading to 10100 times lower plasma drug concentration of pomalidomide  thalidomide and its analogs help with the costimulation of tcells through the b7cd28 complex by phosphorylating tyrosine on the cd28 receptor  in vitro data suggests this costimulation leads to increased th1 type cytokine release of ifn\u03b3 and il2 that further stimulates clonal t cell proliferation and natural killer cell proliferation and activity this enhances natural and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity  lenalidomide and pomalidomide are about 1001000 times more potent in stimulating tcell clonal proliferation than thalidomide in addition in vitro data suggests pomalidomide reverts th2 cells into th1 by enhancing transcription factor tbet  angiogenesis or the growth of new blood vessels has been reported to correspond with mm progression where vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and its receptor bfgf  and il6  appear to be required for endothelial cell migration during angiogenesis thalidomide and its analogs are believed to suppress angiogenesis through modulation of the abovementioned factors where potency in antiangiogenic activity for lenalidomide and pomalidomide was 23 times higher than for thalidomide in various in vivo assays  thalidomide has also been shown to block nf\u03bab activity through the blocking of il6 and nf\u03bab has been shown to be involved in angiogenesis  inhibition of tnf\u03b1 is not the mechanism of thalidomides inhibition of angiogenesis since numerous other tnf\u03b1 inhibitors do not inhibit angiogenesis  in vivo antitumor activity of thalidomide is believed to be due to the potent antiangiogenic effect and also through changes in cytokine expression in vitro assays on apoptosis in mm cells have been shown when treated with thalidomide and its analogs to upregulate the activity of caspase8 this causes cross talking of apoptotic signaling between caspase8 and caspase9 leading to indirect upregulation of caspase9 activity   further antitumor activity is mediated through the inhibition of apoptosis protein2  and prosurvival effects of igf1 increasing sensitivity to fas mediated cell death and enhancement of tnfrelated apoptosis inducing ligand  they have also been shown to cause dose dependent g0g1 cell cycle arrest in leukemia cell lines  where the analogs showed 100 times more potency than thalidomide  the role of angiogenesis in the support of myleoma was first discovered by vacca in 1994  they discovered increased bone marrow angiogenesis correlates with myeloma growth and supporting stromal cells are a significant source for angiogenic molecules in myeloma this is believed to be a main component of the mechanism in vivo by which thalidomide inhibits multiple myeloma additionally inflammatory responses within the bone marrow are believed to foster many hematological diseases the secretion of il6 by bone marrow stromal cells bmsc and the secretion of the adhesion molecules vcam1 icam1 and lfa is induced in the presence of tnf\u03b1 and the adhesion of mm cells to bmsc in vitro proliferation of mm cell lines and inhibition of fasmediated apoptosis is promoted by il6  thalidomide and its analogs directly decrease the upregulation of il6 and indirectly through tnf\u03b1 thereby reducing the secretion of adhesion molecules leading to fewer mm cells adhering to bmsc osteoclasts become highly active during mm leading to bone resorption and secretion of various mm survival factors they decrease the levels of adhesion molecules paramount to osteoclast activation decrease the formation of the cells that form osteoclasts and downregulate cathepsin k an important cysteine protease expressed in osteoclasts  in vitro apremilast reduces pde4 activity leading to an increase in cyclicadenosine monophosphate camp concentrations in immune and nonimmune cell types partially inhibiting the production of many proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf\u03b1 ifn\u03b3 il2 il12 and il23 and elevating the production of the antiinflammatory cytokine il10    the inhibition potency of apremilast in tnf\u03b1 production is similar to lenalidomide  thalidomides teratogenicity has been a subject of much debate and over the years numerous hypotheses have been proposed two of the bestknown have been the antiangiogenesis hypothesis and oxidative stress model hypothesis with considerable experimental evidence supporting these two hypotheses regarding thalidomides teratogenicity  recently new findings have emerged that suggest a novel mechanism of teratogenicity cereblon is a 51 kda protein localized in the cytoplasm nucleus and peripheral membrane of cells in numerous parts of the body  it acts as a component of the e3 ubiquitin ligase regulating various developmental processes including embryogenesis carcinogenesis and cell cycle regulation through degradation ubiquitination of unknown substrates thalidomide has been shown to bind to cereblon inhibiting the activity of the e3 ubiquitin ligase resulting in accumulation of the ligase substrates and downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 8 fgf8 and fgf10 this disrupts the positive feedback loop between the two growth factors possibly causing both multiple birth defects and antimyeloma effects findings also support the hypothesis that an increase in the expression of cereblon is an essential element of the antimyeloma effect of both lenalidomide and pomalidomide  cereblon expression was three times higher in responding patients compared to nonresponders and higher cereblon expression was also associated with partial or full response while lower expression was associated with stable or progressive disease  thalidomide has been approved by the fda for enl

trials for psoriasis and phase ii trials for rheumatoid arthritis efficacy in ankylosing spondylitis is also being tested  as of march 2014 apremilast has been approved for psoriatic arthritis  in september 2014 the us fda approved apremilast for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis the thalidomide molecule is a synthetic derivative of glutamic acid and consists of a glutarimide ring and a phthaloyl ring   its iupac name is 226dioxo3piperidylisoindoline13dione and it has one chiral center  after thalidomides selective inhibition of tnf\u03b1 had been reported a renewed effort was put in thalidomides clinical development the clinical development led to the discovery of new analogs which strived to have improved activities and decreased sideeffects   clinically thalidomide has always been used as a racemate generally the sisomer is associated with the infamous teratogenic effects of thalidomide and the r isomer is devoid of the teratogenic properties but conveys the sedative effects  however this view is highly debated and it has been argued that the animal model that these different r and s effects were seen in was not sensitive to the thalidomide teratogenic effects later reports in rabbits which is a sensitive species unveiled teratogenic effects from both isomers     moreover the thalidomide enantiomers have been shown to be interconversed in vivo due to the acidic chiral hydrogen in the asymmetric center shown for the em12 analog in figure 3   so the plan to administer a purified single enantiomer to avoid the teratogenic effects will most likely be in vain    one of the analogs of interest was made by isoindolinone replacement of the phthaloyl ring it was given the name em12 figure 3 this replacement was thought to increase the bioavailability of the substance because of increased stability the molecule had been reported to be an even more potent teratogenic agent than thalidomide in rats rabbits and monkeys additionally these analogs are more potent inhibitors of angiogenesis than thalidomide as well the aminothalidomide and amino em12 were potent inhibitors of tnf\u03b1  these two analogs later got the name lenalidomide which is the em12 amino analog and pomalidomide the thalidomide amino analog  after finding a novel set of analogs of thalidomide namely 313dioxo13 dihydroisoindol2yl334dimethoxyphenyl propionic acid not shown which had pde4 inhibition activity the work began to optimize the activity for that purpose the researchers used a known structure moiety 34dialkoxyphenyl that is a recognized pharmacophore in pde4 inhibitors such as rolipram figure 5 and roflumilast and added it onto the structure of the previously mentioned analog series after tweaking the structure and testing different substitution at the 4position of the phthaloyl ring and at the carboxyl acid the researchers finally landed at a molecule that potently inhibits pde4 and tnf\u03b1 which they later named apremilast the senantiomer of apremilast was chosen since it was the more active enantiomer  since the structure of apremilast lacks the acidic chiral hydrogen it should not racemize in vivo unlike thalidomide lenalidomide and pomalidomide   since the mechanism of action of thalidomide and its analogs is not fully clear and the bioreceptor for these substances has not been identified the insight into the relationship between the structure and activity of thalidomide and its analogs are mostly derived from molecular modelling and continued research investigation   the information on sar of thalidomide and its analogs is still in process so any trends detailed here are observed during individual studies research has mainly focused on improving the tnf\u03b1 and pde4 inhibition of thalidomide   as well as the antiangiogenesis activity   research indicated that a substitution at the phthaloyl ring would increase tnf\u03b1 inhibition activity figure 5 an amino group substitution was tested at various locations on the phthaloyl ring c4 c5 c6 c7 of thalidomide and em12 previously described amino addition at the c4 location on both thalidomide and em12 resulted in much more potent inhibition of tnf\u03b1 this also revealed that the amino group needed to be directly opposite the carbonyl group on the isoindolinone ring system for the most potent activity  these analogs do not inhibit pde4 and therefore do not act by pde4 inhibition other additions of longer and bigger groups at the c4 and c5 position of the phthaloyl ring system of thalidomide some with an olefin functionality have been tested with various results increased inhibitory effect compared to thalidomide was noticed with the groups that had an oxygen atom attached directly to the c5 or c4 olefin iodine and bromide addition at c4 or c5 resulted in equal or decreased activity compared to thalidomide  these groups were not compared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide the common structure for analogs that inhibit tnf\u03b1 via inhibition of pde4 is prepared on the basis of hydrolysing the glutarimide ring of thalidomide these analogs do not have an acidic chiral hydrogen unlike thalidomide and would therefore be expected to be chirally stable  on the phenyl ring a 34 dialkoxyphenyl moiety figure 6 is a known pharmacophore in pde4 inhibitors such as rolipram optimal activity is achieved with a methoxy group at the 4position x2 and a bigger group such as cyclopentoxy at the 3position carbon x3 however the thalidomide pde4 inhibitory analogs do not follow the sar of rolipram analogs directly for thalidomide analogs an ethoxy group at x3 and a methoxy group at x2 with x1 being just a hydrogen gave the highest pde4 and tnf\u03b1 inhibition  substitutes larger than diethoxy at the x2x3 position had decreased activity the effects of these substitutions seem to be mediated by steric effects  for the yposition a number of groups have been explored substituted amides that were larger than methylamide conhch3 decrease pde4 inhibition activity  using a carboxylic acid as a starting point an amide group has similar pde4 inhibition activity but both groups were shown to be a considerably less potent than a methyl ester group which had about sixfold increase in pde4 inhibitory activity sulfone group had similar pde4 inhibition as the methyl ester group the best pde4 inhibition was observed when a nitrile group was attached which has 32 times more pde4 inhibitory activity than the carboxyl acid  substituents at y leading to increasing pde4 inhibitory activity thus followed the order substitutions on the phthaloyl ring have been explored and it was noticed that nitro groups at the 4c or 5c location decreased activity but 4c or 5c amino substitution increased it dramatically  when the substitution at the 4 z location on the phthaloyl ring was examined hydroxyl and methoxy groups seem to make the analog a less potent pde4 inhibitor an increase in activity was observed with amino and dimethylamino to a similar extent but a methyl group improved the activity further than the aforementioned groups a 4nacetylamino group had slightly lower pde4 inhibitory activity compared with the methyl group but increased the compounds tnf\u03b1 inhibitory activity to a further extent  substituents at z leading to increasing pde4 inhibitory activity thus followed the order for angiogenesis inhibition activity an intact glutarimide ring seems to be required different groups were tested in the r position the substances that had nitrogen salts as the r group showed good activity the improved angiogenesis inhibitory activity could be due to increased solubility or that the positively charged nitrogen has added interaction with the active site tetrafluorination of the phthaloyl ring seems to increase the angiogenesis inhibition  described here are ways of synthesising thalidomide lenalidomide pomalidomide and apremilast synthesis of thalidomide has usually been performed as seen in scheme 1 this synthesis is a reasonably simplistic three step process the downside of this process however is that the last step requires a hightemperature melt reaction which demands multiple recrystallizations and is not compliant with standard equipmentscheme 2 is the newer synthesis route which was designed to make the reaction more direct and to produce better yields this route uses lglutamine rather than lglutamic acid as a starting material and by letting it react with ncarbethoxyphthalimide gives nphthaloyllglutamine 4 with 5070 yield the substance 4 is then stirred in a mixture with carbonyldiimidazole cdi with enough 4dimethylaminopyridine dmap in tetrahydrofuran thf to catalyze the reaction and heated to reflux for 1518 hours during the reflux thalidomide crystallizes out of the mixture the final step gives 8593 yield of thalidomide bringing the total yield to 4363  both of the amino analogs are prepared from the condensation of 3aminopiperidine26dione hydrochloride compound 3 which is synthesized in a two step reaction from commercially available cbzlglutamine the cbzlglutamine is treated with cdi in refluxing thf to yield cbzaminoglutarimide to remove the cbz protecting group hydrogenolysis under 5060 psi of hydrogen with 10 pdc mixed with ethyl acetate and hcl was performed the formulated hydrochloride compound 3 in scheme 3 was then reacted with 3nitrophthalic anhydride in refluxing acetic acid to yield the 4nitro substituted thalidomide analog and the nitro group then reduced with hydrogenation to give pomalidomide  lenalidomide is synthesized in a similar way using compound 3 3aminopiperidine26dione treated with a nitrosubstituted methyl 2bromomethyl benzoate and hydrogenation of the nitro group  in the synthesis of apremilast compound 3 in scheme 5 is produced in a 41 yield from compound 2 treated with lithium hexamethyldisilazide in mixture with lithium dimethylsulfone and boron trifluoride etherate the resolution of compound 3 was accomplished by treating it with nacetyllleucine yielding 3s the final step then uses condensation of 3nacetylaminophthalic anhydride with 3s to afford apremilast 1s in 75 yield

V a mongolian spot also known as mongolian blue spot congenital dermal melanocytosis  and dermal melanocytosis  is a benign flat congenital birthmark with wavy borders and irregular shape in 1883 it was described and named after mongolians by erwin bälz a german anthropologist based in japan     it normally disappears three to five years after birth and almost always by puberty  the most common color is blue although they can be bluegray blueblack or deep brown   the mongolian spot is a congenital developmental condition  that is one existing from birth  exclusively involving the skin the blue colour is caused by melanocytes melanincontaining cells that are usually located in the surface of the skin the epidermis but are in the deeper region the dermis in the location of the spot  usually as multiple spots or one large patch it covers one or more of the lumbosacral area lower back the buttocks sides and shoulders  it results from the entrapment of melanocytes in the lower half to twothirds of the dermis during their migration from the neural crest to the epidermis during embryonic development  male and female infants are equally predisposed to mongolian spot  people who are not aware of the background of the mongolian spots may mistake them for bruises possibly resulting in unfounded concerns about abuse    infants may be born with one or more mongolian spots ranging from small area on the buttocks to a larger area on the back the spot is prevalent among east southeast north and central asian peoples malay archipelago islanders indigenous oceanians chiefly micronesians and polynesians africans  amerindians  east africans latin americans and caribbeans of mixedrace descent and turkish people    they occur in about 9095 of asian and 8085 native american infants  approximately 90 of polynesians and micronesians are born with mongolian spots as are about 46 of children in latin america  where they are associated with noneuropean descent these spots also appear on 510 of babies of full caucasian descent coria del río in spain has a high incidence due to the presence of descendants of the first japanese official envoy to spain in the early 17th century   black babies have mongolian spots at a frequency of 96  almost the entire mestizo mixed spanishindian people of mexico have the mongolian spot  central americans indigenous children were subjected to racism due to their mongolian spots but progressive circles began to make having the mongolian spot popular after the late 1960s  highland peruvians have the mongolian spot  the french anthropologist robert gessain interested himself in what he called the tache pigmentaire congenitale or coloured birthmark publishing multiple papers in the journal de la société des américanistes an academic journal covering the cultural anthropology of the americas gessain spent time with the huehuetla tepehua people in hidalgo mexico and wrote in 1947 about the spots location shape colour histology chemistry genetic transmission and racial distribution he had previously spent several winters in greenland and wrote an overview in 1953 of what was known about the spot he hypothesised that the age at which it faded in various populations might prove to be a distinguishing characteristic of those groups gessain claimed that the spot was first observed amongst the eskimo  hans egede saabye a danish priest and botanist spent 17701778 in greenland his diaries published in 1816 and translated into several european languages contained much ethnographic information he described the spot on newborns saying he had seen it often when the infants were presented naked for baptism a second danish observer was doctor and zoologist daniel frederik eschricht mainly based in copenhagen in 1849 he wrote of the mixed babies he had delivered at the lyingin hospital he also says that the observation made for the first time by saabye about eskimo children has been completely confirmed by captain holbøll who sent him a fetus pickled in alcohol   gessain goes on to state that it was only in 1883 that an anthropologist mentions the spot it was erwin bälz a german working in tokyo who described a dark blue mark on japanese infants he presented his findings in 1901 in berlin and from that point on bälzs name was associated with certain skin cells containing pigment captain gustav frederik holm wrote in 1887 that his greenlandic interpreter johannes hansen known as hanserak attested to the existence of the birthmark over the kidney region of newborns which grows larger as they grow older that year the danish anthropologist soren hansen drew the connection between the observations of bälz in japan and saabye in greenland this cannot be a coincidence it is not the first time that the resemblance between the japanese and the eskimo has been pointed out fridtjof nansen the norwegian polar explorer said that the spot was widespread in the mixed danisheskimo population of west greenland soren hansen confirmed this and further hypothesised that in both japan and greenland the spot might indicate an african connection a sign of direct descent from a black racial element see historical race concepts a missionary in bethel alaska a traditional gathering place of yupik people reported that the spots were common on children rudolf trebitsh an austrian linguist and ethnologist spent the summer of 1906 on the west coast of greenland and listed all the examples he came across gessain went to north labrador in 1926 looking for children with these spots in 1953 dr saxtorph medical advisor to the greenland department part of the danish government wrote that the greenlanders do not like outsiders to see or discuss these birthmarks they doubtless feel as a reminiscence of the time when they lived on a low cultural level   the presence or absence of the mongolian spot was used by racial theorists such as joseph deniker 18521918 the french anthropologist  the journal of cutaneous diseases including syphilis volume 23 contained several accounts of the mongolian spot on children in the americas a marriage between a chinese man and a white mexican woman was recorded in current anthropological literature volumes 12 published in 1912 titled note on two children born to a chinese and a mexican white note sur deux enfants nes dun chinois et d une mexicaine de race blanche ibid 122125 portr treats briefly of chen tean of hong kong his wife inez mancha a white mexican married in 1907 and their children a boy born april 14 1908 and a girl born september 24 1909 the boy is of marked chinese type the girl much more european no mongolian spots were noticed at birth both children were born with red cheeks neither has ever been sick the boy began to walk at ten months the girl a little after a year       the mongolian spot is referred to in the japanese idiom shiri ga aoi \u5c3b\u304c\u9752\u3044 meaning to have a blue butt   which is a reference to immaturity or inexperience in mexico where its name is the green butt spanish rabo verde it is referred to as la patada de cuauhtémoc meaning cuauhtémocs kick korean mythology explains the spot as a bruise formed when samshin halmi korean \uc0bc\uc2e0\ud560\ubbf8 a shaman spirit to whom people pray around childbirth slapped the babys behind to hasten the baby to quickly get out from his or her mothers womb in ecuador the native indians of colta are insultingly referred to in spanish by a number of terms which allude to the mongolian spot  in spanish it is called mancha mongólica

V saethrechotzen syndrome scs also known as acrocephalosyndactyly type iii is a rare congenital disorder associated with craniosynostosis premature closure of one or more of the sutures between the bones of the skull this affects the shape of the head and face resulting in a coneshaped head and an asymmetrical face individuals with scs also have droopy eyelids ptosis widely spaced eyes hypertelorism and minor birth defects of the hands and feet syndactyly  in addition individuals with more severe cases of scs may have mild to moderate mental retardation or learning disabilities depending on the level of severity some individuals with scs may require some form of medical or surgical intervention  most individuals with scs live fairly normal lives regardless of whether medical treatment is needed or not    the cranium consists of three main sections including the base of the cranium occipital bone the face frontal bone and the top parietal bones and sides temporal bone of the head most of the bones of the cranium are permanently set into place prior to birth however the temporal and parietal bones are separated by sutures which remain open allowing the head to slightly change in shape during childbirth the cranial sutures eventually close within the first couple of years following birth after the brain has finished growing  in individuals with scs the coronal suture separating the frontal bones from the parietal bones closes prematurely craniosynostosis occasionally even before birth if the coronal suture closes asymmetrically or unilaterally then the face and forehead will form unevenly from sidetoside people with scs have pointy towerlike heads because their brain is growing faster than their skull resulting in increased intracranial pressure icp and causing the top of the head andor forehead to bulge out to allow for brain growth the face appears uneven particularly in the areas of the eyes and cheeks and the forehead appears wide and tall  because of the abnormal forehead there is less space for the normal facial features to develop this results in shallow eye sockets and flat cheekbones the shallow eye sockets make the eyes more prominent or bulging and cause the eyes to be more separated than normal hypertelorism the underdeveloped eye sockets cheekbones and lower jaw cause the face to appear flat furthermore the minor downward slant of the eyes along with the drooping eyelids ptosis adds to the overall unevenness of the face  scs is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait however on occasion children with a microdeletion of 7p21 chromosome containing the locus responsible for scs develop new abnormalities and typically show significant neurological abnormalities an increased parental age may play a role in the development of new mutations and abnormalities  linkage analysis and chromosomal rearrangement revealed the cause of scs to be mutations in the twist gene twist transcription factor gene located on chromosome 7p21 the twist gene encodes a basic helixloophelix bhlh transcription factor that controls head mesenchyme development as the cranial tube forms more than 35 varying twist mutations involving the bhlh domain of the protein have been identified in people with scs the mutations include missense nonsense and frameshift deletioninsertion mutations that either shorten or disrupt the bhlh domain most individuals with scs have a single large deletion in the region 7p21 which contains the region that codes for the twist gene  in searching for the gene responsible for scs scientists at johns hopkins childrens center began studying the twist gene because its effects on mice the twist gene in mice functions in the development of the muscle and skeleton of the face head hands and feet mice that were lacking both copies of the twist gene were spontaneously aborted prior to birth and had serious deformities including abnormal limb and head defects and failure of the neural tube to properly close however mice with a single copy of the nonworking twist gene survived further examination revealed that these mice had only minor skull hand and foot defects similar to those seen in scs the mouse twist gene is located on chromosome 12 in mice which corresponds to the short arm of chromosome 7 in humans with this information scientists began to isolate and map the human twist gene on the short arm of human chromosome 7 they revealed that the human twist gene was in the same region that was absent in people with scs while looking for different mutations in the human twist gene five different types of mutations were discovered in individuals with scs since none of these mutations were seen in normal individuals who didnt have scs this provided enough evidence to conclude that the twist gene was the causative agent of scs1 researchers also studied the twist gene in drosophila fruit fly in order to determine its function they discovered that in the presence of two twist protein molecules combined together the twist gene functions as a dna transcription factor meaning it binds to the dna doublehelix at specific locations in order to control which genes are turned on or activated the majority of the identified mutations in the twist gene interfere with how the protein attaches to dna preventing the activation of other genes that would normally be turned on during fetal development  individuals with scs are all affected differently even within the same family affected individuals have different features the majority of individuals with scs are moderately affected with uneven facial features and a relatively flat face due to underdeveloped eye sockets cheekbones and lower jaw in addition to the physical abnormalities people with scs also experience growth delays which results in a relatively short stature although most individuals with scs are of normal intelligence some individuals may have mild to moderate mental retardation iq from 5070 more severe cases of scs with more serious facial deformities occurs when multiple cranial sutures close prematurely  prenatal diagnosis of saethrechotzen syndrome in high risk pregnancies is doable but very uncommon and rarely performed furthermore this is only possible if the mutation causing the disease has already been identified within the family genome there are a few different techniques in which prenatal testing can be carried out prenatal testing is usually performed around 1518 weeks using amniocentesis to extract dna from the fetuss cells prenatal testing can also be performed during weeks 1012 using chorionic villus sampling cvs to extract dna from the fetus  recently there has been an increased interest in utilizing ultrasound equipment in order to detect fetal skull abnormalities due to immature fusion of the cranial sutures  the overall diagnosis of scs is primarily based on clinical findings and observations based on dysmorphology examination assessing structural defects and radiographic evaluation xrays mris and ct scans  the clinical diagnosis of scs is generally based on the presence of the following characteristics  a clinical diagnosis of scs can be verified by testing the twist1 gene only gene in which mutations are known to cause scs for mutations using dna analysis such as sequence analysis deletionduplication analysis and cytogenetics fish analysis sequence analysis of exon 1 twist1 coding region provides a good method for detecting the frequency of mutations in the twist1 gene these mutations include nonsense missense splice site mutation and intragenic deletionsinsertions deletionduplication analysis identifies mutations in the twist1 gene that are not readily detected by sequence analysis common methods include pcr multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification mlpa and chromosomal microarray cma cytogeneticfish analysis attaches fluorescently labels dna markers to a denatured chromosome and is then examined under fluorescent lighting which reveals mutations caused by translocations or inversions involving 7p21 occasionally individuals with scs have a chromosome translocation inversion or ring chromosome 7 involving 7p21 resulting in atypical findings such as increased developmental delay  individuals with scs typically have normal brain functioning and rarely have mental impairments for this reason if an individual has both scs and mental retardation then they should have their twist1 gene screened more carefully because this is not a normal trait of scs  cytogenetic testing and direct gene testing can also be used to study genechromosome defects cytogenetic testing is the study of chromosomes to detect gains or losses of chromosomes or chromosome segments using fluorescent in situ hybridization fish andor comparative genomic hybridization cgh direct gene testing uses blood hair skin amniotic fluid or other tissues in order to find genetic disorders direct gene testing can determine whether an individual has scs by testing the individuals blood for mutations in the twist1 gene  up until recently experts frequently disagreed on whether a patient had scs crouzon syndrome isolated craniosynostosis or some other disease because the symptoms are so closely related they literally had no way of differentiating between all of them however we now have direct gene testing which allows for a more definitive diagnosis because it allows them to be differentiated from each other based on which gene is mutated in each condition  the following is a list of conditions commonly confusedmisdiagnosed for scs some of their symptoms and which mutated gene each contains the physical abnormalities resulting from scs are typically mild and only require a minor surgical procedure or no procedure at all one of the common symptoms of scs is the development of short brachydactyly webbed fingers and broad toes syndactyly these characteristics do not cause any problems to the function of the hands or feet and thus no medical procedure is required to fix the abnormalities unless the patient requests it webbing of the fingers may affect the base of the fingers resulting in delayed hand growth during childhood but this contributes no functional impairments sometimes individuals with scs develop broad toes because the bones at the ends of the toes are duplicating themselves this is especially seen in the big toe but requires no surgical intervention because it doesnt negatively affect the overall function of the foot individuals with these toe abnormalities walk normally and can wear normal footwear  in more severe cases frequent surgeries and clinical monitoring are required throughout development a child born with asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis should undergo cranioplasty within its first year of life in order to prevent increased intracranial pressure and to prevent progressive facial asymmetry cranioplasty is a surgical procedure to correct prematurely fused cranial bones the surgery acts to reconstruct and reposition the bones and sutures in order to promote the most normal growth  cranioplasty is necessary in order to continue to grow and is important for two main reasons first of all the skull needs to be able to accommodate the growing brain following childbirth which it cant because the skull doesnt grow as fast as the brain as long as the sutures remain fused this results in an increase in pressure surrounding the brain and inhibits the brain from growing causing the individual to experience significant problems and if left untreated can eventually lead to death secondly cranioplasty may be required for appearance purposes  this is especially the case in individuals with asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis which requires reconstructive surgery of the face and skull if cranioplasty is not performed especially in individuals with unilateral coronal synostosis then facial asymmetry will get worse and worse over time which is why cranioplasty should be performed as soon as possible  surgery may also be required in individuals with vision problems vision problems usually arise due to a lack of space in the eye orbit and skull because of the abnormal bone structure of the face decreased space may also lead to abnormal or missing tear ducts and nerve damage reconstructive surgery is usually required in order to increase cranial space correct tear duct stenosis andor correct ptosis of the eyelids in order to prevent amblyopia lazy eye  midfacial surgery may also be required during early childhood to correct respiratory problems dental malocclusion and swallowing difficulties a cleft palate is also corrected with surgery and may involve the use of tympanostomy tubes if needed an individual will undergo orthognathic treatment andor orthodontic treatment after facial development is complete  since hearing loss is frequently associated with scs it is recommended that audiology screening persist throughout childhood  after cranial reconstructive surgery a child may be required to wear a molding helmet or some other form of head protection until the cranial bones set into place this typically takes about three months and depends on the childs age and the severity of the condition following recovery individuals with scs look and act completely normal so no one would even be able to tell that they have scs  scs is the most common craniosynostosis syndrome and affects 1 in every 25000 to 50000 individuals  it occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and affects males and females equally  if a parent carries a copy of the scs gene mutation then there is a 50 chance their child will also carry a copy of the gene mutation in which case the child may or may not show signs of scs there is also a 50 chance their child will have two working copies of the gene and would therefore not have scs if both parents carry a single copy of the scs gene mutation then there is a 25 chance their child will have two gene mutation copies so child would develop severe scs a 25 chance their child would have two normal copies of the gene so would be completely normal and a 50 chance their child would carry one gene mutation copy and 1 normal copy so child may or may not display scs  in rare situations two normal parents can have a child with scs due to a de novo mutation the exact cause of the de novo mutation is unknown but it doesnt seem to be related to anything that the parents did or didnt do during the pregnancy  scs due to a de novo mutation is so rare that the proportion of past cases is unknown  in 1931 haakon saethre a norwegian psychiatrist described similar characteristics between a mother and her two daughters they all had long and uneven facial features lowset hairlines short fingers and webbing between the second and third fingers and between the second third and fourth toes a year later in 1932 f chotzen a german psychiatrist described a father and his two sons as having very similar characteristics as the mother and her daughters as well as having hearing loss short stature and mild mental retardation hence the name saethrechotzen syndrome was derived from the two scientists who had separately described the condition without any previous knowledge of the other

V an epispadias is a rare type of malformation of the penis in which the urethra ends in an opening on the upper aspect the dorsum of the penis it can also develop in females when the urethra develops too far anteriorly it occurs in around 1 in 120000 male and 1 in 500000 female births    epispadias is an uncommon and partial form of a spectrum of failures of abdominal and pelvic fusion in the first months of embryogenesis known as the exstrophy  epispadias complex while epispadias is inherent in all cases of exstrophy it can also much less frequently appear in isolation as the least severe form of the complex spectrum it occurs as a result of defective migration of the genital tubercle primordii to the cloacal membrane and so malformation of the genital tubercle at about the 5th week of gestation  most cases involve a small and bifid penis which requires surgical closure soon after birth often including a reconstruction of the urethra where it is part of a larger exstrophy not only the urethra but also the bladder bladder exstrophy or the entire perineum cloacal exstrophy are open and exposed on birth requiring closure  despite the similarity of name an epispadias is not a type of hypospadias and involves a problem with a different set of embryologic processes  women can also have this type of congenital malformation epispadias of the female may occur when the urethra develops too far anteriorly exiting in the clitoris or even more forward for females this may not cause difficulty in urination but may cause problems with sexual satisfaction frequently the clitoris is bifurcated at the site of urethral exit and therefore clitoral sensation is less intense during sexual intercourse due to frequent stimulation during urination however with proper stimulation using either manual or positional techniques clitoral orgasm is definitely possible  the main treatment for isolated epispadias is a comprehensive surgical repair of the genitourinary area usually during the first 7 years of life including reconstruction of the urethra closure of the penile shaft and mobilisation of the corpora the most popular and successful technique is known as the modified cantwellransley approach in recent decades however increasing success has been achieved with the complete penile disassembly technique despite its association with greater and more serious risk of damage  even with successful surgery patients may have longterm problems with

V cubitus varus varus means a deformity of a limb in which part of it is deviated towards the midline of the body is a common deformity in which the extended forearm is deviated towards midline of the body cubitus varus is often referred to as gunstock deformity due to the crooked nature of the healing   the opposite condition is cubitus valgus   a common cause is the supracondylar fracture of humerus it can be corrected via a corrective osteotomy of the humerus and either internal or external fixation of the bone until union  cubitus varus is not able to be diagnosed until after healing of the prior fracture as the arm must be in full extension not flexion for the deformity to be noticed a cubitus varus deformity is more cosmetic than limiting of any function  however internal rotation of the radius over the ulna may be limited due to the overgrowth of the humerus this may be noticeable during an activity such as using a computer mouse instances in which the medial epicondyle of the distal humerus is malformed due to the initial fracture at the humeral endplate may result in subluxation snapping of the ulnar nerve over the medial epicondyle with active flexion and extension of the elbow in such instances conductance of the ulnar nerve may be compromised due to chronic irritation potentially resulting in irreversible ulnar neuropathy

V millerdieker syndrome abbreviated mds millerdieker lissencephaly syndrome mdls and chromosome 17p133 deletion syndrome  is a micro deletion syndrome characterized by congenital malformations a physical defect detectable in an infant at birth which can involve many different parts of the body including the brain hearts lungs liver bones or intestinal tract in this case it is usually mainly the brain being affected the congenital malformation can be genetic random and of unknown origin the malformation is in fact characterized by lissencephaly smooth brain mds is a contiguous gene syndrome as well which is a disorder due to the deletion of multiple gene loci that are adjacent to one another the disorder arises from the deletion of part of the small arm of chromosome 17p which includes both the lis1 and 1433 epsilon genes leading to partial monosomy there may be unbalanced translocations ie 17q17p or 12q17p or the presence of a ring chromosome 17 this syndrome should not be confused with miller syndrome an unrelated rare genetic disorder or miller fisher syndrome a form of guillainbarré syndrome   with the use of prenatal ultrasonographic imaging early detection of abnormal brain development in the fetus with mds can be seen at birth facial dysmorphism can be present in the infant young children when affected can suffer from feeding difficulties severe intellectual disability developmental delay and seizures an early way to detect this syndrome in children can be by brain mri which can show the image of smooth brain also called lissencephaly  children with this syndrome may remain underdiagnosed because of how rare it is and how common it is to have facial features that appear to be dysmorphic they are highly variable and not easily recognizable because this syndrome shares distinct external features phenotype similar to more common syndromes lack of relevant family history can also prevent suspicion in many cases fdna provides a service that in turn increases the chances of detecting these distinct characteristics which when shown to a geneticist can assist in reaching the right medical diagnosis if a couple has had one child with mds they can be offered prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies this option is particularly important for the 20 of mds families where one parent carries a balanced chromosome rearrangement the risk for these couples to have another affected child depends on the exact type of chromosome rearrangement present and may be as high as 2533 for families in which both parents chromosomes are normal the risk of having another child with mds is low 1 or less either chorionic villus sampling cvs or amniocentesis can be used early in a pregnancy to obtain a small sample of cells from the developing embryo for chromosome studies early prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is not reliable because the brain is normally smooth until later in pregnancy couples who are considering prenatal diagnosis should discuss the risks and benefits of this type of testing with a geneticist or genetic counselor the brain is usually grossly abnormal in outline when someone is diagnosed with millerdieker syndrome only a few shallow sulci and shallow sylvian fissures are seen this takes on an hourglass or figure8 appearance on the axial imaging the thickness and measurement for a person without mds is 34mm with mds a persons cortex is measured at 1220mm the brain is abnormally smooth with fewer folds and grooves the face especially in children has distinct characteristics including a short nose with upturned nares thickened upper lip with a thin vermilion upper border frontal bossing small jaw lowset posteriorily rotated ears sunken appearance in the middle of the face widely spaced eyes and hypertelorism the forehead is prominent with bitemporal hollowing  characteristics that are not visual include mental retardation pre and postnatal growth retardation epilepsy and reduced lifespan failure to thrive feeding difficulties seizures and decreased spontaneous activity are often seen and death often occurs in infancy and childhood also multiple abnormalities of the brain kidneys and gastrointestinal tract the stomach and intestines can occur mds is a microdeletion syndrome it involves loss of a the gene pafah1b1 on chromosome 17 which is responsible for the syndromes characteristic sign of lissencephaly the loss of another gene ywhae in the same region of chromosome 17 increases the severity of the lissencephaly in patients with millerdieker syndrome additional genes in the deleted region are likely to contribute to the varied features of millerdieker syndrome  it may be a random event during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development or due familial chromosomal rearrangement called chromosomal translocation in less than 20 inheritance is through an autosomal dominant pattern the parent is usually unaffected but carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation in which no genetic material is gained or lost increased rate of unexplained fetal loss may be observed in mds carriers with balanced translocations although they may be otherwise asymptomatic  however they can become also unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation millerdieker syndrome is usually not inherited the deletion event occurs randomly during gametogenesis formation of eggs or sperm or in early foetal development  therefore no history of the disorder is usually seen in their families  the disease may be diagnosed by cytogenetic techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization fish testing for a microdeletion at lis1  while no cure for mds is available yet many complications associated with this condition can be treated and a great deal can be done to support or compensate for functional disabilities because of the diversity of the symptoms it can be necessary to see a number of different specialists and undergo various examinations including most individuals with this condition do not survive beyond childhood individuals with mds usually die in infancy because they do not live to the age where they can reproduce they cannot transmit mds to their offspring millerdieker occurs in less than one in 100000 people and can occur in all races  mds was named for the two physicians j miller and h dieker who independently described the condition in the 1960s the hallmark of mds is lissencephaly a condition in which the outer layer of the brain the cerebral cortex is abnormally thick and lacks the normal convolutions gyri in some areas of the brain gyri are fewer in number but wider than normal pachygyri other areas lack gyri entirely agyri normally during the third and fourth months of pregnancy the brain cells in the baby multiply and move to the surface of the brain to form the cortex lissencephaly is caused by a failure of this nerve cell migration mds is often called millerdieker lissencephaly syndrome it is named for james q miller  and h dieker  jq miller described the disease and in 1969 h dieker emphasized that it should also take the name lissencephaly syndrome because several malformations occur beyond the brain itself when mds was described in the beginning geneticists assumed it followed an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance in the early 1990s several patients with millerdieker syndrome were found to be missing a small portion of the chromosome 17 17p133 a partial deletion

V hexachlorophene also known as nabac is an organochlorine compound that was once widely used as a disinfectant the compound occurs as a white solid although commercial samples can be offwhite and can be odorless or possess a slightly phenolic odor in medicine hexachlorophene is very useful as a topical antiinfective antibacterial agent often used in soaps and toothpaste it is also used in agriculture as a soil fungicide plant bactericide and acaricide    in 1972 the us food and drug administration fda halted the production and distribution of products containing more than 1 of hexachlorophene  after that point most products that contain hexachlorophene were available only by prescription from a doctor  the restrictions were enacted after reports of 15 deaths in the united states and 39 deaths in france were reported following brain damage caused by hexachlorophene   at least two companies manufactured overthecounter preparations incorporating hexachlorophene one product was baby magic bath by the mennen company mennen recalled the product in 1971 and it was removed from retail distribution immediately after the withdrawal there was an outbreak of staphylococcus infections in hospitals across the usa  two commercial preparations using hexachlorophene phisoderm and phisohex were widely used as effective antibacterial skin cleansers in the treatment of acne with phisoderm developed for those allergic to the active ingredients in phisohex in the us during the 1960s both were available over the counter after the ban was enacted phisoderm was reformulated without hexachlorophene and continued to be sold overthecounter while phisohex which contained 3 hexachlorophene three times the legal limit imposed in 1972  became available and remain available today as a prescription body wash in the european community countries during the 1970s and 1980s phisohex was available over the counter a related product phisoac was used as a skin mask to dry and peel away acne lesions another preparation phisoscrub was a hexachloropheneimpregnated sponge for scrubbing has since been discontinued several substitute products including triclosan were developed but none had the germkilling capability of hexachlorophene sanofiaventis was the sole manufacturer of phisohex while the mentholatum company owns the phisoderm brand today sanofiaventis discontinued production of several forms of phisohex in august 2009 and discontinued all production of phisohex in september 2013  the formula for dial soap was changed to remove hexachlorophene after the fda put an end to overthecounter availability in 1972  hexacholorophene is produced by alkylation of trichlorophenol with formaldehyde related antiseptics are prepared similarly eg bromochlorophene and dichlorophene  the ld50 oral rat is 59mgkg indicating that the compound is relatively toxic its usefulness has been limited by this toxicity not other factors such as mutagenicity nor teratogenicity  trade names for hexachlorophene include acigena almederm at7 at17 bilevon exofene fostril gamophen g11 germamedica hexosan k34 septisol surofene

V hip dysplasia developmental dysplasia of the hip ddh  or congenital dysplasia of the hip cdh  is a congenital or developmental deformation or misalignment of the hip joint hip dysplasia can range from barely detectable to severely malformed or dislocated the congenital form teratologic or nonreducible dislocation occurs as part of more complex conditions the condition can be bilateral or unilateral if the joint is fully dislocated a false acetabulum often forms often higher up on the pelvis opposite the dislocated femoral head position in acetabular dysplasia the acetabulum socket is too shallow or deformed the centeredge angle is measured as described by wiberg  two forms of femoral dysplasia are coxa vara in which the femur head grows at too narrow an angle to the shaft and coxa valga in which the angle is too wide a rare type the beukes familial hip dysplasia is found among afrikaners that are members of the beukes family the femur head is flat and irregular sufferers develop osteoarthritis at an early age  hip dysplasia is considered to be a multifactorial condition that means that several factors are involved in causing the condition to manifest  its cause is unknown but it is common in cases of a large fetus or a fetus in a breech position some studies suggest a hormonal link  specifically the hormone relaxin has been indicated  a genetic factor is indicated since the trait runs in families and there is an increased occurrence in some ethnic populations eg native americans  lapps   sami people  a locus has been described on chromosome 13  beukes familial dysplasia on the other hand was found to map to an 11cm region on chromosome 4q35 with nonpenetrant carriers not affected  as an acquired condition it has often been linked to traditions of swaddling infants  use of overly restrictive baby seats carriers and other methods of transporting babies  or use of a cradle board which locks the hip joint in an adducted position pulling the knees together tends to pull the heads of the femur bone out of the sockets or acetabulae for extended periods modern swaddling techniques such as the hip healthy swaddle have been developed to relieve stress on hip joints caused by traditional swaddling methods  further risk factors include breech birth gender genetics family history  and firstborns  in breech position the femoral head tends to get pushed out of the socket a narrow uterus also facilitates hip joint dislocation during fetal development and birth most countries have standard newborn exams that include a hip joint exam screening for early detection of hip dysplasia sometimes during an exam a click or more precisely clunk in the hip may be detected  although not all clicks indicate hip dysplasia  when a hip click also known as clicky hips in the uk is detected the childs hips are tracked with additional screenings  to determine if developmental dysplasia of the hip is caused  two maneuvers commonly employed for diagnosis in neonatal exams are the ortolani maneuver and the barlow maneuver  the condition can be confirmed by ultrasound  and xray  ultrasound imaging yields better results defining the anatomy until the cartilage is ossified when the infant is around 3 months old a clear roentgenographic image can be achieved unfortunately the time the joint gives a good xray image is also the point at which nonsurgical treatment methods cease to give good results in xray imaging dislocation may be indicated if the shentons line an arc drawn from the medial aspect of the femoral neck through the superior margin of the obturator foramen  does not result in a smooth arc however in infants this line can be unreliable as it depends on the rotation of the hip when the image is taken   xray showing calculations for working out hip dysplasia xray image showing hip dysplasia in an infant asymmetrical gluteal folds and an apparent limblength inequality can further indicate unilateral hip dysplasia  most vexingly many newborn hips show a certain ligamentous laxity on the other hand severely malformed joints can appear stable that is one reason why followup exams and developmental monitoring are important frequency and methods of routine screenings in children is still in debate however physical examination of newborns followed by appropriate use of hip ultrasound is widely accepted  the harris hip score  developed by william h harris md an orthopedist from massachusetts is one way to evaluate hip function following surgery other scoring methods are based on patients evaluation like eg the oxford hip score hoos and womac score  childrens hospital oakland hip evaluation scale chohes is a modification of the harris hip score that is currently being evaluated  hip dysplasia can develop in older age adolescents and adults with hip dysplasia may present with hip pain and in some cases hip labral tears xrays are used to confirm a diagnosis of hip dysplasia ct scans and mri scans are occasionally used too   some sources prefer developmental dysplasia of the hip ddh to congenital dislocation of the hip cdh finding the latter term insufficiently flexible in describing the diversity of potential complications  the use of the word congenital can also imply that the condition already exists at birth this terminology introduces challenges because the joint in a newborn is formed from cartilage and is still malleable making the onset difficult to ascertain the newer term ddh also encompasses occult dysplasia eg an underdeveloped joint without dislocation and a dislocation developing after the newborn phase the term is not used consistently in pediatricneonatal orthopedics it is used to describe unstabledislocatable hips and poorly developed acetabula for adults it describes hips showing abnormal femur head or acetabular xrays   some sources prefer the term hip dysplasia over ddh considering it to be simpler and more accurate partly because of the redundancy created by the use of the terms developmental and dysplasia  types of ddh include subluxation dysplasia and dislocation the main types are the result of either laxity of the supporting capsule or an abnormal acetabulum in 1979 dr john f crowe  et al proposed a classification to define the degree of malformation and dislocation grouped from least severe crowe i dysplasia to most severe crowe iv  this classification is very useful for studying treatment results rather than using the wiberg angle because it makes it difficult to quantify the degree of dislocation they used 3 key elements to determine the degree of subluxation a reference line at the lower rim of the teardrop junction between the femoral head and neck of the respective joint and the height of the pelvis vertical measurement they studied anteroposterior pelvic xrays and drew horizontal lines through the lower rim of a feature called teardrop the distance between this line and the middle lines of the junction between femur head and neck gave them a measure of the degree of femur head subluxation they further established that a normal diameter of the femur head measures 20 of the height of the pelvis if the middle line of the neckhead junction was more than 10 of the pelvis height above the reference line they considered the joint to be more than 50 dislocated the following types resulted hip dysplasia presents a nearly perfect equilibrium between the arthritis movementmobility problems and pain associated with the developmental malformation and the arthritis movementmobility problems and pain that are as often as not in moderate to severe cases inflicted by the treatment itself however given the very real possibility of a limp constant andor debilitating pain complicated treatment and impaired mobility later in life careful developmental monitoring is indicated and early intervention is often the result the worst possible consequence of non treatment is developing early arthritis sometimes even during teenage years all treatment aims to delay the onset of arthritis but no treatment is fully successful in avoiding it and all available treatments bear the risk of inflicting equivalent damage most unfortunately studies have as yet been unable to find a method of predicting outcomes in either the surgicalorthopedic treatment of the condition in infants and young children or the surgical treatment of these early treatments negative outcomes later in life such as arthritis avascular necrosis trochanteric bursitis and bone spurs of up to 2cm just medial of the gluteus maximus insertion point on the greater trochanter due to excessive friction early hip dysplasia can often be treated using a pavlik harness  see photograph or the frejka pillowsplint  in the first year of life with usually normal results complications can occur when using the pavlik harness cases of femoral nerve palsy  and avascular necrosis of the femoral head have been reported with the use of the pavlik harness  but whether these cases were due to improper application of the device or a complication encountered in the course of the disorder remains unresolved complications arise mainly because the sheet of the iliopsoas muscle pushes circumflex artery against the neck of the femur and decreases blood flow to the femoral head that is the reason why the frejka pillow is not indicated in all the forms of the developmental dysplasia of the hip this final sentence is not a conclusion of the preceding sentencesshould it say why the pavlik harness  baby wearing a bock harness diagram of pavlik harness diagram of frejka pillow traction other devices employed include the spica cast  particularly following surgical closed reduction open reduction or osteotomy in babies and young children traction is sometimes used in the weeks leading up to a surgery to help stretch ligaments in the hip joint although its use is controversial and varies amongst physicians  in older children the adductor and iliopsoas muscles may have to be treated surgically because they adapt to the dislocated joint position contracture braces and splints are often used following either of these methods to continue treatment although some children outgrow untreated mild hip dysplasia  and some forms of untreated dysplasia cause little or no impairment of quality of life studies have as yet been unable to find a method of predicting outcomes on the other hand it has often been documented that starting treatment late leads to complications and ends in poor results hip dysplasia is often cited as causing osteoarthritis of the hip at a comparatively young age dislocated load bearing surfaces lead to increased and unusual wear although there are studies that contradict these findings see    periacetabular osteotomy pao surgery can be used to realign the hip joint in some adolescents and adults subsequent treatment with total hip arthroplasty hip replacement is complicated by a need for revision surgery replacing the artificial joint owing to skeletal changes as the body matures looseningwear or bone resorption hip resurfacing is another option for correcting hip dysplasia in adults it is a type of hip replacement that preserves more bone and may work for younger hip dysplasia patients  osteotomies are either used in conjunction with arthroplasty or by themselves to correct misalignment determining the incidence can be difficult   in addition there is a wide margin in diagnostic results a german study comparing two methods resulted in twice the usual rate for one method an instability rate of 160 has been described though this rate drops to 1240 at one week  the condition is eight times more frequent in females than in males  the frejka pillow splint was named after dr bedrich frejka 18901972 a czech orthopedic surgeon the pavlik harness was named after dr arnold pavlik 19021962 also a czech orthopedic surgeon in the television program er kerry weaver uses a crutch owing to congenital hip dysplasia in season 12 she undergoes a hip replacement to cure her dysplasia when her previously untreated joint worsens  in dogs hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that in its more severe form can eventually cause crippling lameness and painful arthritis of the joints it is a genetic polygenic trait that is affected by environmental factors it can be found in many animals but is most commonly associated with dogs and is common in many dog breeds particularly the larger breeds hip dysplasia is one of the most studied veterinary conditions in dogs and the most common single cause of arthritis of the hips  one avenue of research is using stem cells they are applied in grafting bone grafting or by seeding porous arthroplasty prosthesis with autologous fibroblasts or chondrocyte progenitor cells to assist in firmly anchoring the artificial material in the bone bed

V duodenal atresia also known as duodenojejunal atresia is the congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the lumen of the duodenum it causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy polyhydramnios and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies radiography shows a distended stomach and distended duodenum which are separated by the pyloric valve a finding described as the doublebubble sign treatment includes suctioning out any fluid that is trapped in the stomach providing fluids intravenously and surgical repair of the intestinal closure   duodenal atresia occurs in 1 in every 500010000 live births  approximately 2040 percent of all infants with duodenal atresia have down syndrome  approximately 8 all infants with down syndrome have duodenal atresia  during pregnancy duodenal atresia is associated with increased amniotic fluid in the uterus which is called polyhydramnios  this increase in amniotic fluid is caused by the inability of the fetus to swallow the amniotic fluid and absorb it in their digestive tract after birth duodenal atresia may cause abdominal distension especially of the upper abdomen bilious vomiting commonly occurs within the first day of life the vomiting is described as bilious because it contains bile acid the diagnosis of duodenal atresia is usually confirmed by radiography an xray of the abdomen shows two large air filled spaces the socalled double bubble sign   the air is trapped in the stomach and proximal duodenum which are separated by the pyloric sphincter creating the appearance of two bubbles visible on xray since the closure of the duodenum is complete in duodenal atresia no air is seen in the distal duodenum atresias occurring distal to the duodenum are usually caused by vascular accidents or ischemic insult such as jejunoileal atresia early treatment includes removing fluids from the stomach via a nasogastric tube and providing fluids intravenously  the definitive treatment for duodenal atresia is surgery duodenoduodenostomy which may be performed openly or laparoscopically  the surgery is not urgent  the initial repair has a 5 percent morbidity and mortality rate  prognosis is usually very good although complications are more likely to occur when there are serious congenital anomalies  late complications may occur in about 12 percent of patients with duodenal atresia and the mortality rate for these complications is 6 percent

V polycystic kidney disease pkd or pckd also known as polycystic kidney syndrome is a genetic disorder in which abnormal cysts develop and grow in the kidneys  cystic disorders can express themselves at any point infancy childhood or adulthood  the disease occurs in humans and some other animals pkd is characterized by the presence of multiple cysts hence polycystic typically in both kidneys however 17 of cases initially present with observable disease in one kidney with most cases progressing to bilateral disease in adulthood    signs and symptoms include high blood pressure headaches abdominal pain blood in the urine and excessive urination  other symptoms include pain in the back headaches and cyst formation renal and other organs  polycystic kidney disease is a general term for the two types of pkd each having their own pathology and causes the two types of pkd are autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease adpkd and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease arpkd which differ in their mode of genetic inheritance   autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease adpkd is the most common of all the inherited cystic kidney diseases    with an incidence of 1500 live births   studies show that 10 of endstage kidney disease eskd patients being treated with dialysis in europe and the us were initially diagnosed and treated for adpkd   there are three genetic mutations in the pkd1 pkd2 and pkd3 gene with similar phenotypical presentations gene pkd1 is located on chromosome 16 and codes for a protein involved in regulation of cell cycle and intracellular calcium transport in epithelial cells and is responsible for 85 of the cases of adpkd a group of voltagelinked calcium channels are coded for by pkd2 on chromosome 4 pkd3 recently appeared in research papers as a postulated third gene   fewer than 10 of cases of adpkd appear in nonadpkd families cyst formation begins in utero from any point along the nephron although fewer than 5 of nephrons are thought to be involved as the cysts accumulate fluid they enlarge separate entirely from the nephron compress the neighboring kidney parenchyma and progressively compromise kidney function   autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease arpkd omim 263200 is the lesser common of the two types of pkd with an incidence of 120000 live births and is typically identified in the first few weeks after birth unfortunately the kidneys are often underdeveloped resulting in a 30 death rate in newborns with arpkd   some indications are that both autosomal and recessive polycystic kidney disease cyst formation is tied to ciliamediated signaling that is irregular further the polycystin1 and polycystin2 proteins appear to be involved in both autosomal and recessive polycystic kidney disease due to defects in both proteins  both proteins have communication with calcium channel proteins this causes reduction in resting intracellular calcium and endoplasmic reticulum storage of calcium  the disease is characterized by a second hit phenomenon in which a mutated dominant allele is inherited from a parent with cyst formation occurring only after the normal wildtype gene sustains a second genetic hit resulting in renal tubular cyst formation and disease progression  specifically pkd is thought to result from defects in the primary cilium an immotile hairlike cellular organelle present on the surface of most cells in the body anchored in the cell body by the basal body  in the kidney primary cilia have been found to be present on most cells of the nephron projecting from the apical surface of the renal epithelium into the tubule lumen in response to fluid flow over the renal epithelium the primary cilium is bent resulting in a flowinduced increase in intracellular calciumwhile it is not known how defects in the primary cilium lead to cyst development it is thought to possibly be related to disruption of one of the many signaling pathways regulated by the primary cilium including intracellular calcium hedgehog wnt\u03b2catenin cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp or planar cell polarity pcpfunction of the primary cilium is impaired resulting in disruption of a number of intracellular signaling cascades that produce dedifferentiation of cystic epithelium increased cell division increased apoptosis and loss of resorptive capacity   adpkd individuals might have a normal life conversely arpkd can cause kidney dysfunction and can lead to kidney failure by the age of 4060 adpkd1 and adpkd2 are very different in that adpkd2 is much milder  currently there are no therapies proven effective to prevent the progression polycystic kidney disease autosomal dominant  obviously if and when the disease progresses enough in a given case the nephrologist or other practitioner and the patient will have to decide what form of renal replacement therapy will be used to treat endstage kidney disease kidney failure typically stage 4 or 5 of chronic kidney disease  that will either be some form of dialysis which can be done at least two different ways at varying frequencies and durations whether it is done at home or in the clinic depends on the method used and the patients stability and training and eventually if they are eligible because of the nature and severity of their condition and if a suitable match can be found unilateral or bilateral kidney transplantation  a cochrane review study of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease made note of the fact that it is important at all times while avoiding antibiotic resistance of course to control infections of the cysts in the kidneys and if affected the liver when needed for a certain duration to combat infection by using quote bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal drugs lastly the study also noted that the direction of research quote has been focused on the genetics and pathophysiology of adpkd and on promising therapies aimed at cyst initiation or expansion

V pigeon toe also known as metatarsus varus metatarsus adductus intoe gait intoeing or false clubfoot is a condition which causes the toes to point inward when walking it is most common in infants and children under two years of age  and when not the result of simple muscle weakness  normally arises from underlying conditions such as a twisted shin bone or an excessive anteversion femoral head is more than 15 from the angle of torsion resulting in the twisting of the thigh bone when the front part of a persons foot is turned in severe cases are considered a form of clubfoot    the cause of intoeing can be differentiated based on the location of the disalignment the variants are   the most common form of being pigeon toed when the feet bend inward from the middle part of the foot to the toes the tibia or lower leg slightly or severely twists inward when walking the femur or thigh bone turns inward when walking most of these conditions are selfcorrecting during childhood in the worst cases surgery may be needed  most of the time this involves lengthening the achilles tendon less severe treatment options for pigeon toe include keeping a child from crossing his or her legs use of corrective shoes and casting of the foot and lower legs which is normally done before the child reaches 12 months of age or older if the pigeon toe is mild and close to the center treatment may not be necessary ballet has been used as a treatment for mild cases dance exercises can help to bend the legs outward

V cerebellar hypoplasia is a disorder found in cats and dogs in which the cerebellum is not completely mature at birth   usually symptoms of cerebellar hypoplasia can be seen immediately at birth in cats but sometimes can take two months or so to become apparent in dogs cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements tremors and generally uncoordinated motion the animal often falls down and has trouble walking  tremors increase when the animal is excited and subside when at ease there are several bacterial infections and viral infections such as feline panleukopenia caused by feline parvovirus while in utero  that can result in the disorder in both cats and dogs the disease can also be caused by malnutrition poisoning injury or general accidents during development in the fetus  the disease does not get better or worse with age but the cat or dog can usually learn to somewhat compensate for it and should have a normal lifespan afflicted animals can in theory lead a fairly normal life if special considerations for the animals disability are taken by the pets owner however the secondary complications such as accidental injuries that occur as a result of having the condition may lead to a shorter lifespan some affected animals are also euthanized due to the severity of the clinical signs there are many ways to avoid injuries for cats or dogs with cerebellar hypoplasia and to allow them to live full lives as any other pet would carpeted flooring allows the animal to move around with much more ease essentially baby proofing sharp corners or heavy objects that could potentially fall on the animal is also important  a related condition seen in cats dogs horses cattle sheep and other animals is cerebellar abiotrophy the symptoms are similar and the two conditions are sometimes confused with each other but cerebellar abiotrophy occurs due to loss of purkinje cells in the cerebellum that occurs after the animal is born cerebellar abiotrophy is usually a genetic condition

V intestinal atresia is a malformation where there is a narrowing or absence of a portion of the intestine this defect can either occur in the small or large intestine   the different types of intestinal atresia are named after their location duodenal atresia has a strong association with down syndrome  it is the most common type followed by ileal atresia an inherited form  familial multiple intestinal atresia  has also been described this disorder was first reported in 1971  it is due to a mutation in the gene ttc7a on short arm of chromosome 2 2p16 it is inherited as an autosomal recessive gene and is usually fatal in infancy the most common cause of nonduodenal intestinal atresia is a vascular accident in utero that leads to decreased intestinal perfusion and ischemia of the respective segment of bowel this leads to narrowing or in the most severe cases complete obliteration of the intestinal lumen in the case that the superior mesenteric artery or another major intestinal artery is occluded large segments of bowel can be entirely underdeveloped classically the affected area of bowel assumes a spiral configuration and is described to have an apple peel like appearance this is accompanied by lack of a dorsal mesentery ileal atresia can also result as a complication of meconium ileus intestinal atresias are often discovered before birth either during a routine sonogram which shows a dilated intestinal segment due to the blockage or by the development of polyhydramnios the buildup of too much amniotic fluid in the uterus these abnormalities are indications that the fetus may have a bowel obstruction which a more detailed ultrasound study can confirm some fetuses with bowel obstruction have abnormal chromosomes an amniocentesis is recommended because it can determine not only the sex of the baby but whether or not there is a problem with the chromosomes fetal and neonatal intestinal atresia are treated using laparotomy after birth if the area affected is small the surgeon may be able to remove the damaged portion and join the intestine back together in instances where the narrowing is longer or the area is damaged and cannot be used for period of time a temporary stoma may be placed

V sickle cell anemia a molecular disease is a 1949 scientific paper by linus pauling harvey a itano seymour j singer and ibert c wells that established sicklecell anemia as a genetic disease in which affected individuals have a different form of the metalloprotein hemoglobin in their blood the paper published in the november 25 1949 issue of science reports a difference in electrophoretic mobility between hemoglobin from healthy individuals and those with sicklecell anemia with those with sickle cell trait having a mixture of the two types the paper suggests that the difference in electrophoretic mobility is probably due to a different number of ionizable amino acid residues in the protein portion of hemoglobin which was confirmed in 1956 by vernon ingram and that this change in molecular structure is responsible for the sickling process it also reports the genetic basis for the disease consistent with the simultaneous genealogical study by james v neel those with sicklecell anemia are homozygous for the disease gene while heterozygous individuals exhibit the usually asymptomatic condition of sickle cell trait  the paper introduced the concept of a molecular disease and is considered a major impetus to the development of molecular medicine the paper helped establish that genes control not just the presence or absence of enzymes as genetics had shown in the early 1940s but also the specific structure of protein molecules  it was also an important triumph in the efforts of pauling and others to apply the instruments and methods of the physical sciences to biology and pauling used it promote such research and attract funding    linus pauling was a prominent physical chemist at the california institute of technology a main focal point of warren weavers efforts to promote what he called molecular biology through rockefeller foundation grants in the mid1930s pauling turned his attention to the physical and chemical nature of hemoglobin in 1946 he set graduate student harvey itano who had been previously trained as a physician the task of finding differences in hemoglobin that might explain sickle cell disease after failing to find any differences in size weight or acidbase titration despite the advanced instruments available at caltech itano found that oxygen could inhibit the sickling process while various reducing agents could speed it up this was the basis of pauling and itanos first publication on the disease itano also found that the globin portion of sickle cell hemoglobin had a barely detectable difference in electrical charge  in order to measure this difference precisely pauling assigned graduate student john singer to work with itano and another medical researcher ibert c wells on using a tiselius apparatus to perform freeboundary electrophoresis before leaving in early 1948 for a guest lectureship in england using the electrophoresis technique paulings researchers were able to estimate that molecules of sicklecell hemoglobin had about three more positive charges than normal hemoglobin   they also estimated that blood from those with sickle cell trait was a mixture of 60 percent normal hemoglobin and 40 percent sicklecell hemoglobin  near the end of the project they learned of parallel results by geneticist james v neel who demonstrated the inheritance pattern of the disease by traditional genetic methods both neels work and that of paulings group were published in the same issue of science  following the 1949 paper itano left the pauling laboratory to work with neel in the following years they used electrophoresis to identify a number of other human hemoglobin variants including some associated with other diseases at caltech a comparison of the amino acid content of normal and sickle cell hemoglobins showed that they had several differences in chemical makeup but did not explain the difference in electric charge that made electrophoretic separation possible the cause of this difference was pinpointed in 1956 and 1957 when vernon ingram used protein fingerprinting to show that the key difference between normal hemoglobins and sickle cell hemoglobins was a single difference in one chain of the protein a glutamic acid residue on the normal hemoglobin in place of a valine residue on the sickle cell hemoglobin the molecular disease concept put forward in the 1949 paper also became the basis for linus paulings view of evolution in the 1960s by which time it had been shown that sickle cell trait confers resistance to malaria and so the gene had both positive and negative effects and demonstrated heterozygote advantage pauling suggested that molecular diseases were actually the basis of evolutionary change  he also advocated eugenic policies such as marking all who carry the sickle cell trait and other molecular disease genes to reduce the number of children born with genetic diseases

V amniotic band constriction also known as amniotic band syndrome adam complex amniotic band sequence congenital constriction bands and pseudoainhum  is a congenital disorder caused by entrapment of fetal parts usually a limb or digits in fibrous amniotic bands while in utero   the constriction of appendages by amniotic bands may result in a strong relationship between abs and clubfoot also called talipes exists a 315 of associated clubfoot deformity and abs can be correlated with 20 occurring bilaterally other abnormalities found with abs include clubhands cleft lip andor cleft palate and hemangioma decreased fetal movement could be a sign of a serious problem which may include abs it is rare but possible for the membrane to become wrapped around the placenta or the neck of the baby in the womb causing strangulation and death to explain the cause of abs there are two main theories the amniotic band theory is that abs occurs due to a partial rupture of the amniotic sac this rupture involves only the amnion the chorion remains intact fibrous bands of the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can encircle and trap some part of the fetus later as the fetus grows but the bands do not the bands become constricting this constriction reduces blood circulation hence causes congenital abnormalities in some cases a complete natural amputation of a digits or limb may occur before birth or the digits or limbs may be necrotic dead and require surgical amputation following birth the vascular disruption theory because the constricting mechanism of the amniotic band theory does not explain the high incidence of cleft palate and other forms of cleft defects occurring together with abs this cooccurrence suggests an intrinsic defect of the blood circulation amniotic band syndrome is often difficult to detect before birth as the individual strands are small and hard to see on ultrasound often the bands are detected indirectly because of the constrictions and swelling upon limbs digits etc misdiagnosis is also common so if there are any signs of amniotic bands further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity 3d ultrasound and mri can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damagedanger to the fetus in rare cases if diagnosed in utero fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation or other deformity this typically would not be attempted if neither vital organs nor the umbilical cord were affected this operation has been successfully performed on fetuses as young as 22 weeks  the surgery took place at melbournes monash medical centre in australia and is believed to be the earliest surgery of its type as surgeons usually hold off on operating until the woman is in week 28 of gestation  there are also several facilities in the united states that have performed successful amniotic band release surgery treatment usually occurs after birth and where plastic and reconstructive surgery is considered to treat the resulting deformity  plastic surgery ranges from simple to complex depending on the extent of the deformity physical and occupational therapy may be needed long term prosthetics may help some abs sufferers to live more functional lives the price and complexity of these prosthetics vary dramatically but advances in 3d printing have helped to increase the availability of artificial fingers while reducing their cost of production  the prognosis depends on the location and severity of the constricting bands every case is different and multiple bands may be entangled around the fetus bands which wrap around fingers and toes can result in syndactyly or amputations of the digits in other instances bands can wrap around limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet in more severe cases the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation amniotic bands can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate if the bands become wrapped around the head or umbilical cord it can be lifethreatening for the fetus the number of cases of miscarriage that can be attributed to abs is unknown although it has been reported that it may be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages amniotic band syndrome is considered an accidental event and it does not appear to be genetic or hereditary so the likelihood of it occurring in another pregnancy is remote the cause of amnion tearing is unknown and as such there are no known preventative measures amniotic banding affects approximately 1 in 1200 live births it is also believed to be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages up to 50 of cases have other congenital anomalies including cleft lip cleft palate and clubfoot deformity hand and finger anomalies occur in up to 80 among the more notable people living with abs are

V teratology is the study of abnormalities of physiological development it is often thought of as the study of human congenital abnormalities but it is broader than that taking in to account other nonbirth developmental stages including puberty and other nonhuman life forms including plants the related term developmental toxicity includes all manifestations of abnormal development by toxic substances these may include growth retardation delayed mental development or other congenital disorders without any structural malformations    the term teratology stems from the greek \u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 teras genitive \u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 teratos meaning monster or marvel and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 logos meaning the word or more loosely the study of  as early as the 17th century teratology referred to a discourse on prodigies and marvels of anything so extraordinary as to seem abnormal in the 19th century it acquired a meaning more closely related to biological deformities mostly in the field of botany currently its most instrumental meaning is that of the medical study of teratogenesis congenital malformations or individuals with significant malformations historically people have used many pejorative terms to describelabel cases of significant physical malformations in the 1960s david w smith of the university of washington medical school one of the researchers who became known in 1973 for the discovery of fetal alcohol syndrome  popularized the term teratology with the growth of understanding of the origins of birth defects the field of teratology as of 2015  overlaps with other fields of science including developmental biology embryology and genetics until the 1940s teratologists regarded birth defects as primarily hereditary in 1941 the first welldocumented cases of environmental agents being the cause of severe birth defects were reported    along with this new awareness of the in utero vulnerability of the developing mammalian embryo came the development and refinement of the six principles of teratology which are still applied today these principles of teratology were put forth by jim wilson in 1959 and in his monograph environment and birth defects  these principles guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms studies designed to test the teratogenic potential of environmental agents use animal model systems eg rat mouse rabbit dog and monkey early teratologists exposed pregnant animals to environmental agents and observed the fetuses for gross visceral and skeletal abnormalities while this is still part of the teratological evaluation procedures today the field of teratology is moving to a more molecular level seeking the mechanisms of action by which these agents act genetically modified mice are commonly used for this purpose in addition pregnancy registries are large prospective studies that monitor exposures women receive during their pregnancies and record the outcome of their births these studies provide information about possible risks of medications or other exposures in human pregnancies understanding how a teratogen causes its effect is not only important in preventing congenital abnormalities but also has the potential for developing new therapeutic drugs safe for use with pregnant women in humans congenital disorders resulted in about 510000 deaths globally in 2010  about 3 of newborns have a major physical anomaly meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance  causes of teratogenesis can broadly be classified as evidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists specialists in ancient disease and injury fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of lifes developmental processes for instance because a tyrannosaurus rex specimen has been discovered with a block vertebra it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the birdlike dinosaur troodon the tip of whose jaw was twisted  another notably deformed fossil was a specimen of the choristodere hyphalosaurus which had two heads the oldest known example of polycephaly  in botany teratology investigates the theoretical implications of abnormal specimens for example the discovery of abnormal flowersfor example flowers with leaves instead of petals or flowers with staminoid pistilsfurnished important evidence for the foliar theory the theory that all flower parts are highly specialised leaves

V a rectovestibular fistula also referred to simply as a vestibular fistula is an anorectal congenital disorder where an abnormal connection fistula exists between the rectum and the vulval vestibule of the female genitalia if the fistula occurs within the hymen it is known as a rectovaginal fistula a much rarer condition    a rectovestibular fistula occurs when the colon or rectum deviates anteriorly  this leads to the formation of an abnormal connection between the rectum and the vulval vestibule immediately posterior to the hymen so that an ectopic anus opens into the fourchette or frenulum of the labia minora  a common wall is shared between the rectum and vagina above the site of the fistula  although the opening of the rectum into the anal canal is shorter and narrower than normal the rectum itself is completely normal  the diagnosis of a rectovestibular fistula can be made in female newborns if the vulva is stained with meconium the earliest form of stool in an infant  the opening of the anus may be difficult to see due to its small size and position but it may be visible as a thickening of the median perineal raphe with an obvious anal dimple   patients with rectovestibular fistulae are commonly misdiagnosed with rectovaginal fistulae  colostomy is recommended by most surgeons and has a good prognosis with 90 of patients regaining normal bowel control  since the rectal opening and anal orifice in a vestibular fistula tend to be short and narrow a colostomy is usually performed to allow decompression of the bowel unless the orifice is wide enough to allow normal defecation  colostomy is often followed by posterior sagittal anorectoplasty psarp a surgical procedure to repair the anal orifice at a later date   some surgeons prefer to perform an immediate psarp without a colostomy first while others perform neither a colostomy nor a psarp and instead opt for a simple dilatation of the orifice to allow stool to pass and the bowel to decompress  it has been suggested that only experienced surgeons should perform repair without an initial colostomy  if a colostomy is not performed immediately after birth patients with rectovestibular fistulae may present later in life with complications including severe constipation and megacolon abnormal dilation of the colon requiring colostomy or further surgery  rectovestibular fistula is the most common defect of the rectum and anal canal in females

V trigonocephaly greek trigonon  triangle kephale  head is a congenital condition of premature fusion of the metopic suture greek metopon  forehead leading to a triangular shaped forehead the merging of the two frontal bones leads to transverse growth restriction and parallel growth expansion it may occur syndromic involving other abnormalities or isolated   in former times people born with malformed skulls were rejected based upon their appearance   this still persists today in various parts of the world even though the intellectual development is often normal  the austrian physician franz joseph gall presented the science of phrenology in the early 19th century through his work the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system in general and of the brain in particular  hippocrates described trigonocephaly as follows mens heads are by no means all like to one another nor are the sutures of the head of all men constructed in the same form thus whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head by prominence is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which projects beyond the rest of it in him the sutures of the head take the form of the greek letter tau \u03c4   hermann welcker coined the term trigonocephaly in 1862 he described a child with a vshaped skull and a cleft lip  trigonocephaly can either occur syndromatic or isolated trigonocephaly is associated with the following syndromes opitz syndrome muenke syndrome jacobsen syndrome ballergerold syndrome and saymeyer syndrome the etiology of trigonocephaly is mostly unknown although there are three main theories  trigonocephaly is probably a multifactorial congenital condition but due to limited proof of these theories this cannot safely be concluded  the first theory assumes that the origin of pathological synostosis lies within disturbed bone formation early on in the pregnancy causes can either be genetic     9p2224 11q23 22q11 fgfr1 mutation  metabolic  tsh suppletion in hypothyroidism   or pharmaceutical  valproate in epilepsy   the second theory says that synostosis begins when the fetal head gets hindered in the pelvic outlet during birth   the third theory predominates disturbed brain formation of the two frontal lobes as the main issue behind synostosis    limited growth of the frontal lobes leads to an absence of stimuli for cranial growth therefore causing premature fusion of the metopic suture the incidence of metopic synostosis is roughly between 1700 and 115000 newborns globally differs per country   trigonocephaly is seen more in males than females ranging from 21 to 651     hereditary relations in metopic synostosis have been found of which 55 were well defined syndromic  maternal age and a birth weight of less than 2500g may also play a role in trigonocephaly  these data are based on estimations and do not give factual information only one article gives valuable and reliable information regarding the incidence of metopic synsostosis in the netherlands the incidence in the netherlands showed an increase from 06 1997 to 19 2007 for every 10000 live births  diagnosis can be characterized by typical facial and cranial deformities   observatory signs of trigonocephaly are imaging techniques 3dct röntgenography mri show the neuropsychological development is not always affected these effects are only visible in a small percentage of children with trigonocephaly or other suture synostoses neuropsychological signs are treatment is surgical with attention to form and volume surgery usually takes place before the age of one since it has been reported that the intellectual outcome is better          a form of surgery is the socalled frontosupraorbital advancement and remodelling firstly the supraorbital bar is remodelled by a wired greenstick fracture to straighten it secondly the supraorbital bar is moved 2cm forward and fixed only to the frontal process of the zygoma without fixation to the cranium lastly the frontal bone is divided into two rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar causing a nude area craniectomy between the parietal bone and frontal bone bone will eventually regenerate since the dura mater lies underneath the dura mater has osteogenic capabilities this results in an advancement and straightening of the forehead the socalled floating forehead technique combined with the remodelling of the supraorbital bar is derived from the frontosupraorbital advancement and remodelling the supraorbital bar is remodelled as described above   the frontal bone is split in two pieces instead of using both pieces as in frontosupraorbital advancement and remodelling only one piece is rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar this technique also leaves a craniectomy behind  the simplest form of surgery for trigonocephaly was suturectomy      however as this technique was insufficient to correct the deformities it is not used anymore distraction osteogenesis is based on creating more cranial space for the brain by gradually moving the bones apart this can be achieved by using springs  these approaches are 2d solutions for a 3d problem therefore the results are not optimal distraction osteogenesis and minimal invasive endoscopic surgery are yet in experimental phase trigonocephaly seems to be the most compliant form of craniosynostosis for surgery  because of standardization of current surgical approaches there is no surgical mortality and complications are few to none    the simple suturectomy is presently insufficient to adjust the complicated growth restrictions caused by metopic synostosis  on the other hand the frontosupraorbital advancement and remodelling and the floating forehead technique create sufficient space for brain growth and result in a normal horizontal axis of the orbits and supraorbital bar the frontosupraorbital advancement and remodelling is the most used method nowadays  over the past few years distraction osteogenesis has been gradually acknowledged since it has a positive effect on hypotelorism expanding the distance between the orbits using springs seems to be successful     however there are discussions whether hypotelorism really needs to be corrected  the minimal invasive endoscopic surgery has been gaining attention since the early 90s however it has technical limitations only strip craniectomy is possible  attempts have been made to reach beyond these limits      aesthetic outcome of metopic synostosis surgery is persistently good with reoperation hazards below 20   in 1981 anderson advised that craniofacial operations for synostosis should be as extensive as necessary after a study of 107 cases of metopic and coronal synostosis  surgery does not provide a 100 natural outcome mostly there will be minor irregularities reoperations are usually performed on more severe cases including syndromic metopic synostosis the hypotelorism and temporal hollowing are the most difficult to correct the hypotelorism usually remains under corrected and a second operation is often needed for correction of temporal hollowing   the highest rate of neurological problems of single suture synostosis are seen in patients with trigonocephaly  surgery is performed generally before the age of one because of claims of better intellectual outcome          seemingly surgery does not influence the high incidence of neurodevelopment problems in patients with metopic synostosis neurological disorders such as adhd asd odd and cd are seen in patients with trigonocephaly these disorders are usually also associated with decreased iq the presence of adhd asd and odd is higher in cases with an iq below 85 this is not the case with cd which showed an insignificant increase at an iq below 85  via a photo shown on a facebook page the mother of a child previously diagnosed with this affliction recognised the symptoms and reported them to the family involved resulting in an immediate diagnosis that medical professionals had overlooked in all earlier consultations

V a supernumerary nipple also known as a third nipple triple nipple accessory nipple  polythelia or the related condition polymastia is an additional nipple occurring in mammals including humans often mistaken for moles supernumerary nipples are diagnosed in humans at a rate of approximately 1 in 3 males  and 1 in 17 females   the nipples appear along the two vertical milk lines which start in the armpit on each side run down through the typical nipples and end at the groin they are classified into eight levels of completeness from a simple patch of hair to a milkbearing breast in miniature   polythelia refers to the presence of an additional nipple alone while polymastia denotes the much rarer presence of additional mammary glands although usually presenting on the milk line pseudomamma can appear as far away as the foot  a possible relationship with mitral valve prolapse has been proposed    the triple nipple club is a documentary shown on channel 4 which explored the biological mystery of the supernumerary nipple  first broadcast on 2 january 2008 it was directed and produced by dan louw and commissioned as part of channel 4s first cut series  the film focuses on louws attempts to understand why he was born with extra nipples a condition he shares with the likes of mark wahlberg  lily allen  and tilda swinton as well as well known tv and film characters such as scaramanga and chandler bing fascinated and confused by this seemingly pointless mutation louw sets off on a personal journey of discovery to try and unwrap the riddle of the triple nipple he starts out by consulting the man in the street and even a renowned teratologist an expert in physical mutations after testing the notion that extra nipples could be a sign of fertility he discovers that they are actually an atavism or evolutionary holdover  a sign of how humans evolved

V club foot or clubfoot also called congenital talipes equinovarus ctev is a congenital deformity involving one foot or both  the affected foot appears to have been rotated internally at the ankle without treatment people with club feet often appear to walk on their ankles or on the sides of their feet however with treatment the vast majority of patients recover completely during early childhood and are able to walk and participate in athletics just as well as patients born without ctev later in life most patients will experience pain and limited mobility  it is a relatively common birth defect occurring in about one in every 1000 live births approximately half of people with clubfoot have it affect both feet which is called bilateral club foot in most cases it is an isolated disorder of the limbs it occurs in males twice as frequently as in females a condition of the same name appears in some nonhuman animals particularly horses though in that particular case it is more akin to stepping en pointe than sideways    hippocrates around 400 bc was the first to offer a medical explanation and to this day there are many hypotheses about how clubfoot develops involving environmental factors genetics or a combination of both no study has pinpointed the root cause but most findings agree that it is likely there is more than one different cause and at least in some cases the phenotype may occur as a result of a threshold effect of different factors acting together  some researchers hypothesize from the early development stages of humans that clubfoot is formed by a malfunction during gestation amniocentesis is believed to increase the rates of this deformity because there is an increase in possible amniotic leakage during the procedure  underdevelopment of the bones and muscles in the embryonic foot may be another underlying cause underdevelopment prevents the fetuss foot from rotating medially leaving it in the club formation after birth it was widely believed in the early 1900s that constriction of the foot by the uterus contributed to clubfoot  underdevelopment of the bones also affects the muscles and tissues of the foot abnormality in the connective tissue causes the presence of increased fibrous tissue in muscles fascia ligaments and tendon sheaths  affected individuals have smaller than normal legs even after corrected further evidence shows that mutations in genes involved in muscle development are risk factors for clubfoot specifically those encoding the muscle contractile complex myh3 tpm2 tnnt3 tnni2 and myh8 these can cause congenital contractures including clubfoot in distal arthrogryposis da syndromes  clubfoot can also be present in patients with genetic conditions such as loeysdietz syndrome modern advances in genetic mapping techniques and the development of models of the disease in mice have improved understanding of developmental processes studies of genetic epidemiology have led to a more recent hypothesis on the etiology of clubfoot its inheritance pattern is explained as a heterogenous disorder using a polygenic threshold model the pitx1tbx4 transcriptional pathway has become key to the study pitx1 and tbx4 are uniquely expressed in the hind limb  further studies duplicating this pathway in models need to be conducted to hopefully find what genetic abnormalities cause clubfoot clubfoot is usually diagnosed immediately after birth simply by looking at the foot it is then up to the doctor whether or not to xray the foot or feet to examine how the internal structures are positioned in some cases it may be possible to detect the disease prior to birth during the ultrasound it may be more prominent if both feet are affected the ability to possibly identify clubfoot before live birth can prove beneficial to the child as different treatments can be explored  once a child has been diagnosed with clubfoot there are many different treatment approaches treatment should be given immediately after diagnosis to take full advantage of the flexibility in the babys bones and joints this allows for improved manipulation to try to achieve a normal foot the ponseti method appears to result in better outcomes than the kite method and similar outcomes to a traditional technique  this involved manipulation by people specialized in the technique with serial casting and then providing braces to hold the feet in a plantigrade position after serial casting a foot abduction brace such as a denis browne bar with straight lace boots ankle foot orthoses andor custom foot orthoses cfo may be used in north america manipulation is followed by serial casting most often by the ponseti method foot manipulations usually begin within two weeks of birth the french method also known as the functional method or physiotherapy method is easiest to do with young bones the childs foot is gradually stretched to achieve the right position being held in place with tape after stretching in the evening the childs foot is hooked up to a machine where it continuously moves the foot while the child sleeps this method is not the most widely used as it is very time consuming  extensive surgery of the soft tissue or bone is not usually necessary to treat clubfoot however there are two minimal surgeries that may be required in most cases extensive surgery is not needed to treat clubfoot extensive surgery may lead to scar tissue developing inside the childs foot the scarring may result in functional growth and aesthetic problems in the foot because the scarred tissue will interfere with the normal development of the appendage a child who has extensive surgery may require on average two additional surgeries to correct the issues presented above  in stretching and casting therapy the doctor changes the cast several times over a few weeks gradually stretching tendons until the foot is in the correct position of external rotation the heel cord is released percutaneous tenotomy and another cast is put on which is removed after three weeks to avoid relapse a corrective brace is worn for a gradually reducing time until it is only at night up to four years of age these treatments tend to be less effective in patients with loeysdietz syndrome because of the underlying connective tissue disorder this treatment requires stretching the foot is repositioned to the normal position then a cast the ponseti cast is placed on top of it the babys foot is then continually repositioned and placed back into a cast once a week for several months towards the end of the process after being in a cast the doctor will then surgically lengthen the heel cord aka achilles tendon after the foot has been realigned maintenance involves routine stretching the child also has to wear special shoes or braces fulltime for three months then just nightly for three years this method can be compared to wearing braces on your teeth parents have to follow the doctors orders for when to wear and not wear the brace to keep the foot corrected failure will occur if the brace is not worn and the foot will return to its odd shape  treatment for clubfoot should begin almost immediately to have the best chance for a successful outcome without the need for surgery over the past 10 to 15 years more and more success has been achieved in correcting clubfeet without the need for surgery the clubfoot treatment method that is becoming the standard in the us and worldwide is known as the ponseti method  foot manipulations differ subtly from the kite casting method which prevailed during the late 20th century although described by dr ignacio ponseti in the 1950s it did not reach a wider audience until it was repopularized around 2000 by dr john herzenberg in the usa and in europe and africa by nhs surgeon steve mannion while working in africa parents of children with clubfeet using the internet also helped the ponseti gain wider attention the ponseti method if correctly done is successful in 95 of cases  in correcting clubfeet using non or minimalsurgical techniques typical clubfoot cases usually require five casts over four weeks atypical clubfeet and complex clubfeet may require a larger number of casts approximately 80 of infants require an achilles tenotomy microscopic incision in the tendon requiring only local anesthetic and no stitches performed in a clinic toward the end of the serial casting after correction has been achieved maintenance of correction may require the fulltime 23 hours per day use of a splintalso known as a foot abduction brace fabon both feet regardless of whether the tev is on one side or both for several weeks after treatment parttime use of a brace generally at night usually 12 hours per day is frequently prescribed for up to four years without the parents participation the clubfoot will almost certainly recur because the muscles around the foot can pull it back into the abnormal position approximately 20 of infants successfully treated with the ponseti casting method may require a surgical tendon transfer after two years of age while this requires a general anesthetic it is a relatively minor surgery that corrects a persistent muscle imbalance while avoiding disturbance to the joints of the foot these treatments tend to be less effective in patients with loeysdietz syndrome because of the underlying connective tissue disorder the common consensus among medical professionals regarding longterm outlook of club foot surgery is a full recovery and normal lifestyle however cases with no adverse impact long term are rare botox is also being used as an alternative to surgery botox is the trade name for botulinum toxin type a a chemical that acts on the nerves that control the muscle it causes some paralysis weakening of the muscle by preventing muscle contractions tightening as part of the treatment for clubfoot botox is injected into the childs calf muscle in about one week the botox weakens the achilles tendon this allows the foot to be turned into a normal position over a period of 46 weeks without surgery the weakness from a botox injection usually lasts from 36 months unlike surgery it has no lasting effect most club feet can be corrected with just one botox injection it is possible to do another if it is needed there is no scar or lasting damage  in severe cases surgery may be the only option to correct the foot after trying all other noninvasive methods for treatment surgery does not ensure full recovery but most babies who underwent the surgery have maintained their normal feet a surgeon will go in and lengthen the muscles and tendons to ease the foot into position after surgery when the cast is removed a brace is to be worn to prevent the foot from returning to the old position  on occasion stretching casting and bracing are not enough to correct a childs clubfoot surgery may be needed to adjust the tendons ligaments and joints in the footankle usually done at 9 to 12 months of age surgery usually corrects all clubfoot deformities at the same time after surgery a cast holds the clubfoot still while it heals it is still possible for the muscles in the childs foot to try to return to the clubfoot position and special shoes or braces will likely be used for up to a year or more after surgery surgery will likely result in a stiffer foot than nonsurgical treatment particularly over time without any treatment a childs clubfoot will result in severe functional disability however with treatment the child should have a nearly normal foot he or she can run and play without pain and wear normal shoes the corrected clubfoot will still not be perfect however a clubfoot usually stays 1 to 1½ sizes smaller and somewhat less mobile than a normal foot the calf muscles in a leg with a clubfoot will also stay smaller many will require orthopedic shoes as adults some will require a leg brace despite previous surgery longterm studies of adults with postclub feet especially those with substantial numbers of surgeries may not fare as well in the long term according to dobbs et al  a percentage of adults may require additional surgeries as they age though there is some dispute as to the effectiveness of such surgeries in light of the prevalence of scar tissue present from earlier surgeries in some cases the leg stops developing earlier than the healthy leg and a substantial length difference may occur in some cases a leg lengthening will be necessary most commonly by use of the ilizarov method treatment of clubfoot is evident as early as egyptian paintings in early days  the foot was manipulated with a thomas wrench and casting which caused fracture of several bones in the foot many notable people have been born with one or both feet in clubbed condition including roman emperor claudius statesman prince talleyrand 19thcentury american politician thaddeus stevens comedian damon wayans actor gary burghoff and eric the midget from the howard stern show football players steven gerrard and miguel riffo sledge hockey player matt lloyd a paralympian mathematician ben greenberg and filmmaker jennifer lynch while the british romantic poet george gordon lord byron was wrongly said to suffer from clubfoot he did suffer from a similar condition tendon achillies which caused him much humiliation comedian musician and actor dudley moore was born with a club foot this was mostly unknown to the public as he wore one shoe with a slightly bigger sole to compensate when walking nfl cornerback charles woodson was born with severely clubbed feet and went on to win the heisman award at the university of michigan played in super bowl xxxvii with the oakland raiders and won super bowl xlv with the green bay packers the figureskater kristi yamaguchi was born with a clubfoot and went on to win gold medals at both the 1992 winter olympics and world championships the soccer star mia hamm was born with the condition and won gold twice with team usa in the 1996 olympics and in the 2004 olympics baseball pitcher larry sherry the 1959 world series mvp was born with club feet  as was pitcher jim mecir and both enjoyed long and successful careers in fact it was suggested in the book moneyball that mecirs club foot contributed to his success on the mound it caused him to adopt a strange delivery that put an especially violent spin on his screwball his specialty pitch the san francisco giants held the record as the team with the alltime highest number of players with clubbed feet as of july 2010  and freddy sanchez one of its infielders cites his ability to overcome the defect as a reason for his success  tom dempsey of the new orleans saints born with a right club foot and no toes this was his

hockey league won the red tilson trophy as the most outstanding player in the ohl in 20112012 he was signed by the national hockey leagues florida panthers in july 2012  national socialist and government official in poland austria and netherlands arthur seyssinquart lived his life walking with a clubfoot and was still limping on it when he arrived at the gallows and was hanged as the last condemned prisoner at the nuremberg trials on october 16 1946  nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels had a deformity caused by a botched operation for the bacterial infection osteomyelitis which some mistook for clubfoot  de witt clinton fort who served in the confederate army as a captain was born with a clubfoot and he was known during the american civil war as captain clubfoot fort csa egyptian pharaoh tutankhamun had a club foot and a cleft palate and it is likely that he needed a cane to walk  club feet occur in other animals notably equines the condition is characterized by a strongly upright pastern and a corresponding rotation of the coffin bone in the hoof the condition often affects only one foot severity varies with some animals usable for work or riding and others unsound for life careful farrier work on the hooves can lessen the severity of many cases and in certain circumstances surgery may be beneficial the visible outward appearance of a club foot has different possible origins that include a genetic predisposition to the condition a congenital defect formed while the animal is in the womb or problems with diet and bone development during the early postnatal period certain horse breeds appear to be more predisposed to the condition than others but research has yet to identify the genes involved a grading scale exists to assess the severity of club feet which are caused by a deep digital flexor contraction syndrome when the muscle fibers of the upper legs deep digital flexor muscle contract excessively this affects the tendon of the same name that inserts into this muscle group and attaches at the bottom of the coffin bone a constant upward pull by the tendon on the coffin bone and other structure of the horses hoof creates the condition while many young foals are born with somewhat upright pasterns the condition may resolve naturally or with minimal intervention if begun early however some cases are so severe that more drastic treatment may be required

V an accessory auricle is considered a developmental anomaly resulting from the persistence of a structure which variably recapitulates the normal external ear   there may be several components or degrees of development ranging from an ear tag preauricular appendage preauricular tag accessory tragus to supernumerary ears or polyotia   it is a relatively common congenital anomaly of the first branchial arch or second branchial arches other anomalies may be present concurrently including cleft palate cleft lip or mandibular hypoplasia there is a known association with goldenhar syndrome oculoauriculovertebral syndrome  and with wildervanck syndrome    there may also be an association with congenital cartilaginous rest of the neck the general presentation is of a skincovered nodule papule or nodule of the skin surface usually immediately anterior to the auricle however it may be anywhere within the periauricular tissues bilateral presentation can be seen      the lesions presents as a nodule or papule either sessile or pedunculated they may be soft or have a cartilaginous structure by histologic examination it is a recapitulation of normal external auricle there will be skin cartilaginous structures and cartilage although the later is not seen in all variants of this disorder   some investigators believe that the tragus is the only hillock which is derived from the first branchial arch this is clearly suggestive that true cases of accessory auricle represent a true duplication of the hillocks that were part of the second branchial arch  the second ear appears as a mirror image folded forward and lying on the posterior cheek these structures are distinctly different from squamous papilloma and benign teratoma simple surgical excision is curative  the recommended treatment is that the skin is peeled off the extraauricular tissue and protruding cartilage remnants are trimmed  normal appearance is achieved in majority of cases the reconstruction successful in true cases of accessory auricle as it also is in individuals with auricular appendages   these lesions usually present in neonates although they may not come to clinical attention until adulthood for cosmetic reasons there is no gender predilection they are present in approximately 36 per 1000 live births  lester d r thompson bruce m wenig 2011 diagnostic pathology head and neck published by amirsys hagerstown md lippincott williams  wilkins pp723 isbn1931884617

V acrania is a rare congenital disorder that occurs in the human fetus in which the flat bones in the cranial vault are either completely or partially absent  the cerebral hemispheres develop completely but abnormally  the condition is frequently though not always associated with anencephaly the fetus is said to suffer from acrania if it meets the following criteria the fetus should have a perfectly normal facial bone a normal cervical column but without the fetal skull and a volume of brain tissue equivalent to at least one third of the normal brain size  there are two problems that may occur during development that cause acrania there are no known family ties in acrania and recurrence rates are extremely low not much is known about the exact mechanism involved in acrania it is hypothesized that like other developmental malformations there are multiple origins for acrania recent work has identified mutations in the hedgehog acyltransferase hhat gene that have caused acrania along with holoprosencephaly and agnathia  the mutation in hhat which causes this disease is a lossoffunction mutation  before this discovery in 2010 hhat was known to play a role in the sonic hedgehog pathway when hhat contains a lossoffunction mutation less hhat protein is produced hhat is necessary for the production of hedgehog hh proteins posttranscriptionally as hhat production decreases production of longrange hh proteins decreases proportionally decreases in hh production disturb the production of extracellular signalregulated kinases bone morphogenetic proteins and fibroblast growth factors all of which play important roles in craniofacial patterning disruption of these pathways leads to abnormal bone and cartilage formation causing acrania and multiple other craniofacial patterning problems  little genetic counseling can be offered for acrania because the genetic origins are not fully understood in order to make genetic counseling for families easier this disease is often differentially diagnosed with other diseases that can occur at the same time such as anencephaly and acalvaria though these diseases may not always occur simultaneously  while this disease is tragic reoccurrence rates are extremely low so genetic counseling is not always necessary  during amniotic band syndrome abs fibrous bands may entrap various parts of the developing fetus causing malformations when these fibrous bands form around the developing skull the bones will not form properly abs occurring in the developing brain neural tissue is one cause of acrania  when abs is the cause of acrania the fibrous bands cannot be detected through ultrasound  during the fourth week of human development the neuropore in a normally developing fetus closes when this process is either interrupted or never initiated acrania occurs  the desmocranium becomes a membranous coverage instead of forming the epidermis of the scalp whether from being blocked by amniotic bands or by just not initiating the migration of mesenchyme under the ectoderm does not occur  because this migration does not occur the skull and all involved muscles are never formed  without the presence of the neurocranium the brain fails to separate into two separate lobes the hindbrain proceeds to develop normally allowing for the child to be carried to term but the diencephalon and ocular lobe remain small and underdeveloped  mesenchyme is formed in the developing embryo and will eventually become cartilage and bone when ectodermal mesenchyme fails to migrate into the head region of the embryo the skull will not be able to form what exactly causes the failure of mesenchymal migration is unknown  acrania can be diagnosed early in pregnancy through an ultrasound this abnormality appears during the beginning or end of the fourth week of the fetuss development an absence of the skull is needed in order to make a diagnosis a presence of brain tissue will confirm the diagnosis of acrania and differentiate it from other developmental problems such as anencephaly  prognosis is poor previous research suggested a 100 mortality rate for those with acrania however at least one case of acrania was treated successfully at birth current prognosis for this patient includes developmental delays with normal appearance and intelligence  this disease is rare occurring in 1 in 20000 live births  in order to better manage an acrania diagnosis early detection is of extreme importance so that actions may be taken to help the mother and child  families may choose to either terminate the pregnancy or carry the child to term acrania may cause a fetus to spontaneously abort before reaching term

V a laryngeal cleft or laryngotracheoesophageal cleft is a rare congenital abnormality in the posterior laryngotracheal wall  it occurs in approximately 1 in 10000 to 20000 births  it means there is a gap between the oesophagus and trachea which allows food or fluid to pass into the airway    diagnosis of a laryngeal cleft in an infant often comes after problems with feeding which include coughing cyanosis blue skin and failing to gain weight over time  pulmonary infections are also common  the longer the cleft is the more severe the symptoms a cleft is diagnosed through endoscopic examination specifically microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy   laryngeal clefts are classified into four types according to length typei extends no further down than the vocal cords typeii extends below the vocal cords and into the cricoid cartilage typeiii extends into the cervical section of the trachea and typeiv extends the furthestinto the thoracic section of the trachea  treatment of a laryngeal cleft depends on the length and resulting severity of symptoms a shorter cleft typei may not require surgical intervention  symptoms can be managed by thickening the infants feeds  a slightly longer cleft long typei or shorter typeii is repaired endoscopically a cleft that is longer still typeii or typeiii is repaired directly through the neck with a tracheotomy  2027 of individuals with a laryngeal cleft also have a tracheoesophageal fistula and approximately 6 of individuals with the fistula also have the cleft  other congenital anomalies commonly associated with laryngeal cleft are gastrooesophageal reflux tracheobronchomalacia congenital heart defect dextrocardia and situs inversus  laryngeal cleft can be a component of other genetic syndromes including pallisterhall syndrome and g syndrome opitzfriaz syndrome

V tuberous breasts or tubular breasts are a result of a congenital abnormality  of the breasts which can occur in both men and women also see hypoplasia one breast or both during puberty breast development is stymied and the breasts fail to develop normally and fully the exact cause of this is as yet unclear however a study in 2011 of the cells in the breasts of both males and females with tubular breasts suggested a genetic link in a disorder of collagen deposition  the condition is thought to affect one to five per cent of breast augmentation patients  however the proportion of the general population affected is unknown as surgery is not always sought   the tuberous breast deformity was first described by rees and aston in 1976  following which a method of classifying the severity was developed the surgical classifications refer to which areas of the breast are affected and is divided into three grades mainly in the inferomedial quadrant grade i in the two inferior quadrants grade ii or affecting the whole breast grade iii  this condition is also known as constricted breasts tubular breasts snoopy breasts herniated areolar complexes  conical breast domen nipple lower pole hypoplasia  and hypoplastic breasts tuberous breasts are not simply small or underdeveloped breasts the effect of the condition on the appearance of the breast can range from mild to severe and typical characteristics include enlarged puffy areola unusually wide spacing between the breasts minimal breast tissue sagging higher than normal breast fold  and narrow base at the chest wall the condition can affect the ability of women to breastfeed as in some cases the breasts including the milk glands have not developed enough to produce breast milk  however other physical aspects of fertility and pregnancy are not affected by the condition any deformity of the breasts is only apparent during puberty and this may lead to psychosexual problems with girls in very early puberty being affected psychologically due to the unusual shape of the breast  surgical papers about the techniques useful in correcting tubular breasts note that even when results are not perfect the psychological impact of treatment is immense with notable improvements in selfesteem to the level where the person engages in normal social activities  the appearance of tuberous breasts can potentially be changed through surgical procedures including the tissue expansion method and breast implants  the procedure to change the appearance of tuberous breasts can be more complicated than a regular breast augmentation and some plastic surgeons have specialist training in tuberous breast correction as tuberous breasts are a congenital deformity referral for treatment under the national health service may be possible in the united kingdom  a starting point for those seeking such a referral may be a visit to their local general practitioner for those seeking nonsurgical solutions counseling may be recommended as a way of coming to terms with body image

V ivacaftor trade name kalydeco developed as vx770 is a drug approved for patients with a certain mutation of cystic fibrosis which accounts for 45 cases of cystic fibrosis   ivacaftor was developed by vertex pharmaceuticals in conjunction with the cystic fibrosis foundation and is the first drug that treats the underlying cause rather than the symptoms of the disease  called the most important new drug of 2012  and a wonder drug  it is one of the most expensive drugs costing over us300000 per year which has led to criticism of vertex for the high cost cystic fibrosis is caused by any one of several defects in a protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr which regulates fluid flow within cells and affects the components of sweat digestive fluids and mucus one such defect is the g551d mutation in which the amino acid glycineg in position 551 is replaced with aspartic acidd g551d is characterized by a dysfunctional cftr protein on the cell surface in the case of g551d the protein is trafficked to the correct area the epithelial cell surface but once there the protein cannot transport chloride through the channel ivacaftor a cftr potentiator improves the transport of chloride through the ion channel by binding to the channels directly to induce a nonconventional mode of gating which in turn increases the probability that the channel is open      ivacaftor is used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in persons having one of several specifics mutations in the cftr protein including g551d g1244e g1349d g178r g551s s1251n s1255p s549n s549r or r117h  of the approximately 70000 cases of cystic fibrosis worldwide 4 3000 are due to a mutation called g551d   the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients with this mutation was examined in 2 clinical trials the first trial was performed in adults having baseline respiratory function fev1 between 32 and 98 of normal for persons of similar age height and weight the baseline average was 64 improvement in fev1 was rapid and sustained at the end of 48 weeks people treated with ivacaftor had on average an absolute increase in fev1 of 104 vs a decline of 02 in the placebo group pulmonary exacerbations were reduced by about half in the ivacaftor group relative to the placebo group  in a second trial conducted in children age 6 to 11 the average improvement in fev1 was an absolute increase of 125 in the ivacaftor group at 48 weeks compared to a very slight decline in the placebo group  ivacaftor is approved for use in cystic fibrosis patients in the us canada  and across some european countries the us food and drug administration approved ivacaftor in january 2012 and the european medicines agency ema followed soon after   a third clinical trial examined the effiacy of ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis due to g1244e g1349d g178r g551s s1251n s1255p s549n or s549r mutations this trial which included 39 people of age greater than 6 years used a crossover design the people in the trial had fev1 averaging 78 of normal at baseline the people in the trial were randomized to receive either ivacaftor or placebo for 8 weeks this was followed by a 4 to 8 week washout period then each group received the opposite treatment from what it received in the first part of the trial at week 8 the people on treatment with ivacaftor experienced an average absolute improvement in fev1 of 138 but there was a strong dependence of the efficacy on the exact mutation that a patient had the detailed data for different mutation types is shown in the us package insert  the most common adverse reactions experienced by patients who received ivacaftor in the pooled placebocontrolled phase 3 studies were abdominal pain 156 versus 125 on placebo diarrhoea 128 versus 96 on placebo dizziness 92 versus 10 on placebo rash 128 versus 67 on placebo upper respiratory tract reactions including upper respiratory tract infection nasal congestion pharyngeal erythema oropharyngeal pain rhinitis sinus congestion and nasopharyngitis 633 versus 500 on placebo headache 239 versus 163 on placebo and bacteria in sputum 73 versus 38 on placebo one patient in the ivacaftor group reported a serious adverse reaction abdominal pain  ivacaftor is a potentiator of cftr meaning it allows the defective channel to open and to let chloride ions pass through the channel pore ivacaftor is approximately 99 bound to plasma proteins primarily to alpha 1acid glycoprotein and albumin ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells  ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans in vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolised by cyp3a m1 and m6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans m1 has approximately onesixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active m6 has less than onefiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active  following oral administration the majority of ivacaftor 878 is eliminated in the faeces after metabolic conversion the major metabolites m1 and m6 accounted for approximately 65 of total dose eliminated with 22 as m1 and 43 as m6 there was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent the apparent terminal halflife was approximately 12 hours following a single dose in the fed state the apparent clearance clf of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with cf the mean sd of clf for the 150mg dose was 173 84lh in healthy subjects at steady state  the cost of ivacaftor is 311000 per year roughly similar to the price of other drugs for extremely rare diseases  in the first 9 months of its second year on the market 2014 ivacaftor sales were 339m representing 54 of vertexs product sales revenue during the same period drug development expenses were 458m most of which was spent on cystic fibrosisrelated research  an editorial in jama called the price of ivacaftor exorbitant citing the support by the cystic fibrosis foundation in its development and the contribution made by fundamental scientific research performed by the national institutes of health and relied upon by vertex in its cystic fibrosis drug discovery programs  the company responded in an email that while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis it took vertex scientists 14 years of their own research funded mostly by the company before the drug won approval  the cystic fibrosis foundation a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving healthcare for people with cystic fibrosis provided 150 million of the funding for the development for ivacaftor in exchange for royalty rights in the event that the drug was successfully developed and commercialized in 2014 the foundation sold these royalty rights for 33 billion the foundation has stated that it intends to spend these funds in support of further research   vertex said it would make the drug available free to patients in the united states with no insurance and a household income of under 150000  in 2012 24 us doctors and researchers involved in the development of the drug wrote to vertex to protest the price of the drug which had been set at about 300000 per year in the uk the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients uk agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year qaly at between 335000 and 1274000 well above the national institute for health and care excellence thresholds  the drug was not covered under the ontario drug benefit plan until june 2014 when the province of ontario and the manufacturer negotiated for what ontario health minister deb matthews had called a fair price for taxpayers the negotiations took 16 months and it was estimated that around 20 ontarians required the drug at the time  the province of alberta began covering the drug in july 2014 and in september the province of saskatchewan became the third province to include it in its provincial drug plan  government delays in agreeing to provide ivacaftor in national health plans led to patient group protests in wales   england  and australia

V \u03b4f508 deltaf508 full name cftr\u03b4f508 or f508delcftr rs113993960 is a specific mutation within the gene for a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr the mutation is a deletion of the three nucleotides that comprise the codon for phenylalanine f at position 508 a person with the cftr\u03b4f508 mutation will produce an abnormal cftr protein that lacks this phenylalanine residue this protein does not escape the endoplasmic reticulum for further processing having two copies of this mutation one inherited from each parent is the leading cause of cystic fibrosis cf    the three dna base pairs tag at position 507 of the cftr nucleotide sequence form the template for the mrna codon auc for the amino acid isoleucine while the three dna base pairs aaa at the adjacent position 508 form the template for the codon uuu for phenylalanine  the \u03b4f508 mutation is a deletion of the g pair from position 507 along with two aa pairs from position 508 leaving the dna sequence taa at position 507 forming the codon auu since auu also codes for isoleucine position 507s amino acid is unchanged and the mutations net effect is equivalent to a deletion \u03b4 of the sequence resulting in the codon for phenylalanine f at position 508 \u03b4f508 is present in approximately one in 30 caucasians scientists have estimated that the mutation occurred over 52000 years ago in northern europe one hypothesis as to why the otherwise detrimental mutation has evolved is that it exerts a positive effect by reducing waterloss during cholera a common cause of death in europe when the mutation first appeared  another theory posits that cf carriers heterozygotes for \u03b4f508 are more resistant to typhoid fever since cftr has been shown to act as a receptor for salmonella typhi bacteria into epithelial cells \u03b4f508 is a class ii cftr mutation  the cftr proteinwhen in the proper positionopens channels in the cell membrane which release chloride ions out of respiratory epithelial cells this causes osmosis to draw water out of the cell the \u03b4f508 mutation can prevent the cftr from moving into its proper position in the cell  being a heterozygous carrier having a single copy of \u03b4f508 results in decreased water loss during diarrhea this prevents dehydration and vastly increases the chances of surviving cholera  this same effect may occur during typhoid fever leading to heterozygote advantage and an increase in the frequency of this mutation this has not been adequately proven yet still another theory that has been advanced is that heterozygous carriers are more able to thrive on a dairy milk diet that was characteristic of northwest europe which has a high cf allele frequency  yet another theory for the prevalence of the cf mutation is that it provides resistance to tuberculosis  if two carriers of the gene mate their offspring will have a 25 chance of having two copies of the mutation see also mendelian inheritance generally \u03b4f508 carriers are symptom free however when combined with other mutations varying degrees of cflike symptoms can appear see below several research studies indicate that heterozygous carriers are at increased risk for various symptoms for example having a homozygous pair of genes with the \u03b4f508 mutation prevents the cftr protein from obtaining its normal position in the cell membranes this causes increased water retention in cells and a variety of effects on the body this collection of symptoms is called cystic fibrosis however \u03b4f508 is not the only mutation that causes cf approximately 70 of cystic fibrosis cases in europe are due to double \u03b4f508 this varies widely by region the remaining cases are caused by combinations of that and over 1000 other mutations including r117h 17171ga and 278956ga these mutations when combined with each other or \u03b4f508 cause cf symptoms the genotype is not strongly correlated with severity of the cf however specific symptoms have been linked to certain mutations

V kniest dysplasia is a rare form of dwarfism caused by a mutation in the col2a1 gene on chromosome 12  the col2a1 gene is responsible for producing type ii collagen the mutation of col2a1 gene leads to abnormal skeletal growth and problems with hearing and vision what characterizes kniest dysplasia from other type ii osteochondrodysplasia is the level of severity and the dumbbell shape of shortened long tubular bones  this condition was first diagnosed by dr wilhelm kniest in 1952 dr kniest noticed that his 50 year old patient was having difficulties with restricted joint mobility the patient had a short stature and was also suffering from blindness upon analysis of the patients dna dr kniest discovered that a mutation had occurred at a splice site of the col2a1 gene this condition is very rare and occurs less than 1 in 1000000 people males and females have equal chances of having this condition  currently there is no cure for kniest dysplasia alternative names for kniest dysplasia can include kniest syndrome swiss cheese cartilage syndrome kniest chondrodystrophy or metatrophic dwarfism type ii   studies have shown that a mutated col2a1 gene is responsible for all type ii chondroldysplasias including kniest dysplasia it is believed that point mutations or the alteration of splice sites in col2a1 domains will result in kniest dysplasia the col2a1 domain typically spans between exon 12 and 24 mutations that occur at a splice donor site results in the loss of function at that site this leads to the skipping of the exon and deletion of amino acids the loss of these amino acids result in an abnormal procollagen ii structure the structure is not stable like the normal procollagen ii structure and is normally degraded at a faster rate  because collagen plays an important role in the development of the body people with kniest dysplasia will typically have their first symptoms at birth these symptoms can include  most symptoms are chronic and will continue to worsen as the individual ages it is essential to have regular checkups with general doctorsorthopedist ophthalmologists andor otorhinolaryngologists this will help to detect whether there are any changes that could cause concern  kniest dysplasia is an autosomal dominant condition  this means that the person only needs to have one copy of the mutated gene in order to have the condition people with a family history are at a higher risk of having the disease than people with no family history a random mutation in the gene can cause a person with no family history to also have the condition a combination of medical tests are used to diagnosis kniest dysplasia these tests can include  the images taken will help to identify any bone anomalies two key features to look for in a patient with kniest dysplasia is the presence of dumbbell shaped femur bones and coronal clefts in the vertebrae other features to look for include genetic testing  a genetic sample may be taken in order to closely look at the patients dna finding an error in the col2a1 gene will help identify the condition as a type ii chondroldysplasia because kniest dysplasia can affect various body systems treatments can vary between nonsurgical and surgical treatment patients will be monitored over time and treatments will be provided based on the complications that arise  like treatment options the prognosis is dependent on the severity of the symptoms despite the various symptoms and limitations most individuals have normal intelligence and can lead a normal life a recent article in 2015 reported a persistent notochord in a fetus at 23 weeks of gestation the fetus had an abnormal spine shortened long bones and a left clubfoot after running postmortem tests and ultrasound the researchers believed that the fetus suffered from hypochondrogenesis hypochondrogenesis is caused when type ii collagen is abnormally formed due to a mutation in the col2a1 gene normally the cartilaginous notochord develops into the bony vertebrae in a human body the col2a1 gene results in malformed type ii collagen which is essential in the transition from collagen to bone this is the first time that researchers found a persistent notochord in a human body due to a col2a1 mutation  it is named for wilhelm kniest

V hirschsprungs disease or hirschsprung disease hd also called congenital megacolon or congenital aganglionic megacolon is a form of megacolon that occurs when part or all of the large intestine or antecedent parts of the gastrointestinal tract have no ganglion cells and therefore cannot function during normal prenatal development cells from the neural crest migrate into the large intestine colon to form the networks of nerves called the myenteric plexus auerbach plexus between the smooth muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract wall and the submucosal plexus meissner plexus within the submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract wall in hirschsprungs disease the migration is not complete and part of the colon lacks these nerve bodies that regulate the activity of the colon the affected segment of the colon cannot relax and pass stool through the colon creating an obstruction  in most affected people the disorder affects the part of the colon that is nearest the anus in rare cases the lack of nerve bodies involves more of the colon in five percent of cases the entire colon is affected stomach and esophagus may be affected too hirschsprungs disease occurs in about one in 5000 of live births  it is usually diagnosed in children and affects boys more often than girls   typically hirschsprungs disease is diagnosed shortly after birth although it may develop well into adulthood because of the presence of megacolon or because the baby fails to pass the first stool meconium  within 48 hours of delivery normally 90 of babies pass their first meconium within 24 hours and 99 within 48 hours other symptoms include green or brown vomit explosive stools after a doctor inserts a finger into the rectum swelling of the abdomen lots of gas and bloody diarrhea some cases are diagnosed later into childhood but usually before age 10  the child may experience fecal retention constipation or abdominal distention  with an incidence of one in 5000 births the most cited feature is absence of ganglion cells notably in males 75 percent have none in the end of the colon rectosigmoid and eight percent lack ganglion cells in the entire colon the enlarged section of the bowel is found proximally while the narrowed aganglionic section is found distally closer to the end of the bowel the absence of ganglion cells results in a persistent overstimulation of nerves in the affected region resulting in contraction some extremely rare cases the absence of ganglion cells continues to spread after the corrective surgery resulting in multiple surgeries those patients that also have thyroid cancer may be able to digest food properly but may not be able to use the nutrients properly the most accepted theory of the cause of hirschsprung is that there is a defect in the craniocaudal migration of neuroblasts originating from the neural crest that occurs during the first 12 weeks of gestation defects in the differentiation of neuroblasts into ganglion cells and accelerated ganglion cell destruction within the intestine may also contribute to the disorder  this lack of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexus is welldocumented in hirschsprungs disease  with hirschsprungs disease the segment lacking neurons aganglionic becomes constricted causing the normal proximal section of bowel to become distended with feces this narrowing of the distal colon and the failure of relaxation in the aganglionic segment are thought to be caused by the lack of neurons containing nitric oxide synthase  the equivalent disease in horses is lethal white syndrome  several genes and specific regions on chromosomes loci have been shown or suggested to be associated with hirschsprungs disease hirschsprungs disease can also present as part of a syndrome in waardenburgshah syndrome mowatwilson syndrome goldbergshpritzen megacolon syndrome and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome  the ret protooncogene accounts for the highest proportion of both familial and sporadic cases with a wide range of mutations scattered along its entire coding region  a protooncogene is a gene that can cause cancer if it is mutated or overexpressed research published in 2002 suggested that hirschsprungs may be caused by the interaction between two proteins encoded by two variant genes the ret protooncogene on chromosome 10 was identified as one of the two genes involved the other protein that ret must interact with in order to cause hirschsprungs disease is termed ednrb and is encoded by the gene ednrb located on chromosome 13 hirschsprungs disease hypoganglionosis gut dysmotility gut transit disorders and intussusception have been recorded with the dominantly inherited neurovisceral porphyrias acute intermittent porphyria hereditary coproporphyria variegate porphyria children may require enzyme or dna testing for these disorders as they may not produce or excrete porphyrins prepuberty ret is a gene that codes for proteins that assist cells of the neural crest in their movement through the digestive tract during the development of the embryo those neural crest cells eventually form bundles of nerve cells called ganglions ednrb codes for proteins that connect these nerve cells to the digestive tract thus mutations in these two genes could directly lead to the absence of certain nerve fibers in the colon research published in june 2004 suggests that there are several genes associated with hirschsprungs disease  also new research suggests that mutations in genomic sequences involved in regulating ednrb have a bigger impact on hirschsprungs disease than previously thought ret can mutate in many ways and is associated with down syndrome since down syndrome is comorbid in two percent of hirschsprungs cases there is a likelihood that ret is involved heavily in both hirschprungs disease and down syndrome ret is also associated with thyroid cancer and neuroblastoma which is a type of cancer common in children both of these disorders are more common in hirschsprungs patients than in the general population one function that ret controls is the travel of the neural crest cells through the intestines in the developing fetus the earlier the mutation of ret occurs in hirschsprungs disease the more severe the disorder becomes common and rare dna variations in the neuregulin 1 nrg1 and nrg3 nrg3 were first shown to be associated with the disease in chinese patients through a genome wide association study gwas by the hong kong team in 2009   and 2012 respectively  subsequent studies in both asian and caucasian patients confirmed the initial findings by the university of hong kong both rare and common variants in these two genes have been identified in additional chinese  thai korean indonesian and spanish patients these two genes are known to play a role in the formation of the enteric nervous system thus they are likely to be involved in the pathology of hirschsprung at least in some cases definitive diagnosis is made by suction biopsy of the distally narrowed segment  a histologic examination of the tissue would show a lack of ganglionic nerve cells diagnostic techniques involve anorectal manometry  barium enema and rectal biopsy the suction rectal biopsy is considered the current international gold standard in the diagnosis of hirschsprungs disease  radiologic findings may also assist with diagnosis  cineanography fluoroscopy of contrast medium passing anorectal region assists in determining the level of the affected intestines treatment of hirschsprungs disease consists of surgical removal resection of the abnormal section of the colon followed by reanastomosis the first stage of treatment used to be a reversible colostomy in this approach the healthy end of the large intestine is cut and attached to an opening created on the front of the abdomen the contents of the bowel are discharged through the hole in the abdomen and into a bag later when the childs weight age and condition are right the new functional end of the bowel is connected with the anus the first surgical treatment involving surgical resection followed by reanastomosis without a colostomy occurred as early as 1933 by doctor baird in birmingham on a oneyearold boy orvar swenson who discovered the cause of hirschsprungs first performed its surgical treatment the pullthrough surgery in 1948  the pullthrough procedure repairs the colon by connecting the functioning portion of the bowel to the anus the pullthrough procedure is the typical method for treating hirschsprungs in younger patients swenson devised the original procedure and the pullthrough surgery has been modified many times currently there are several different surgical approaches which include the swenson soave duhamel and boley procedures the swenson procedure leaves a small portion of the diseased bowel the soave procedure leaves the outer wall of the colon unaltered the boley procedure is a small modification of the soave procedure so the term soaveboley procedure is sometimes used   the duhamel procedure uses a surgical stapler to connect the good and bad bowel for the 15 percent of children who do not obtain full bowel control other treatments are available constipation may be remedied by laxatives or a high fiber diet in those patients serious dehydration can play a major factor in their lifestyle a lack of bowel control may be addressed by a stoma similar to a colostomy the malone antegrade colonic enema ace is also an option  in a malone ace a tube goes through the abdominal wall to the appendix or if available to the colon the bowel is then flushed daily  children as young as 6 years of age may administer this daily flush on their own if the affected portion of the lower intestine is restricted to the lower portion of the rectum other surgical procedures may be performed such as a posterior rectal myectomy the prognosis is good in 70 percent of cases chronic postoperative constipation is present in 7 to 8 percent of the operated cases postoperative enterocolitis is a severe manifestation that is present in the 1020 of operated patients according to a 1984 study conducted in maryland hirschsprungs disease appears on 186 per 100000 live births  in japan hirschsprung disease occurs at a similar rate of about one in 5000 births 20 per 100000  it is more common in male rather than female 4321 and in white rather than nonwhite  nine percent of the hirschsprung cases were also diagnosed as having down syndrome  most cases are diagnosed before the patient is 10 years of age  the first report of hirschsprung disease dates back to 1691  however the disease is named after harald hirschsprung the danish physician who first described two infants who died of this disorder in 1888   hirschsprungs disease is a congenital disorder of the colon in which certain nerve cells known as ganglion cells are absent causing chronic constipation  the lack of ganglion cells is in the myenteric plexus auerbachs plexus which is responsible for moving food in the intestine a barium enema is the mainstay of diagnosis of hirschsprungs though a rectal biopsy showing the lack of ganglion cells is the only certain method of diagnosis the first publication on an important genetic discovery of the disease was from martucciello giuseppe et al in 1992 the authors described a case of a patient with total colonic aganglionosis associated with a 46 xx del 10 q1121 q212 karyotype  the major gene of hirschsprung disease was identified in this chromosomal 10 region it was the ret protooncogene  the usual treatment is pullthrough surgery where the portion of the colon that does have nerve cells is pulled through and sewn over the part that lacks nerve cells national digestive diseases information clearinghouse for a long time hirschsprungs was considered a multifactorial disorder where a combination of nature and nurture were considered to be the cause however in august 1993 two articles by independent groups in nature genetics said that hirschsprungs disease could be mapped to a stretch of chromosome 10   this research also suggested that a single gene was responsible for the disorder however the researchers were unable to isolate it edar edar hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia

V ectrodactyly split hand cleft hand  derived from the greek ektroma abortion and daktylos finger  literally abortion of a finger  involves the deficiency or absence of one or more central digits of the hand or foot and is also known as split handsplit foot malformation shfm  the hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as clawlike and may include only the thumb and one finger usually either the little finger ring finger or a syndactyly of the two with similar abnormalities of the feet  it is a rare form of a congenital disorder in which the development of the hand is disturbed it is a type i failure of formation  longitudinal arrest  the central ray of the hand is affected and usually appears without proximal deficiencies of nerves vessels tendons muscles and bones in contrast to the radial and ulnar deficiencies the cleft hand appears as a vshaped cleft situated in the centre of the hand  the digits at the borders of the cleft might be syndactilyzed and one or more digits can be absent in most types the thumb ring finger and little finger are the less affected parts of the hand  the incidence of cleft hand varies from 1 in 90000 to 1 in 10000 births depending on the used classification cleft hand can appear unilateral or bilateral  and can appear isolated or associated with a syndrome split handfoot malformation shfm is characterized by underdeveloped or absent central digital rays clefts of hands and feet and variable syndactyly of the remaining digits shfm is a heterogeneous condition caused by abnormalities at one of multiple loci including shfm1 shfm1 at 7q21q22 shfm2 xq26 shfm3 fbxw4dactylin at 10q24 shfm4 tp63 at 3q27 and shfm5 dlx1 and dlx 2 at 2q31 shfm3 is unique in that it is caused by submicroscopic tandem chromosome duplications of fbxw4dactylin shfm3 is considered isolated ectrodactyly and does not show a mutation of the tp63 gene   ectrodactyly can be caused by various changes to 7q when 7q is altered by a deletion or a translocation ectrodactyly can sometimes be associated with hearing loss  ectrodactyly or split handsplit foot malformation shfm type 1 is the only form of split hand malformation associated with sensorineural hearing loss  a large number of human gene defects can cause ectrodactyly the most common mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance while autosomal recessive and xlinked forms occur more rarely  ectrodactyly can also be caused by a duplication on 10q24 detailed studies of a number of mouse models for ectrodactyly have also revealed that a failure to maintain median apical ectodermal ridge aer signalling can be the main pathogenic mechanism in triggering this abnormality  a number of factors make the identification of the genetic defects underlying human ectrodactyly a complicated process the limited number of families linked to each split handfoot malformation shfm locus the large number of morphogens involved in limb development the complex interactions between these morphogens the involvement of modifier genes and the presumed involvement of multiple gene or longrange regulatory elements in some cases of ectrodactyly  in the clinical setting these genetic characteristics can become problematic and making predictions of carrier status and severity of the disease impossible to predict  in 2011 a novel mutation in dlx5 was found to be involved in shfm  ectrodactyly is frequently seen with other congenital anomalies  syndromes in which ectrodactyly is associated with other abnormalities can occur when two or more genes are affected by a chromosomal rearrangement  disorders associated with ectrodactyly include ectrodactylyectodermal dysplasiaclefting eec syndrome which is closely correlated to the adult syndrome and limbmammary lms syndrome ectrodactylycleft palate ecp syndrome ectrodactylyectodermal dysplasiamacular dystrophy syndrome ectrodactylyfibular aplasiahypoplasia efa syndrome and ectrodactylypolydactyly more than 50 syndromes and associations involving ectrodactyly are distinguished in the london dysmorphology database  the pathophysiology of cleft hand is thought to be a result of a wedgeshaped defect of the apical ectoderm of the limb bud aer apical ectodermal ridge  polydactyly syndactyly and cleft hand can occur within the same hand therefore some investigators suggest that these entities occur from the same mechanism  this mechanism is not yet defined the cause of cleft hand lies for what is known partly in genetics the inheritance of cleft hand is autosomal dominant and has a variable penetrance of 70  cleft hand can be a spontaneous mutation during pregnancy de novo mutation the exact chromosomal defect in isolated cleft hand is not yet defined however the genetic causes of cleft hand related to syndromes have more clarity  the identified mutation for shsf syndrome splithandsplitfoot syndrome a duplication on 10q24 and not a mutation of the tp63 gene as in families affected by eec syndrome ectrodactylyectodermal dysplasiacleft syndrome  the p63 gene plays a critical role in the development of the apical ectodermal ridge aer this was found in mutant mice with dactylaplasia  some studies    have postulated that polydactyly syndactyly and cleft hand have the same teratogenic mechanism in vivo tests showed that limb anomalies were found alone or in combination with cleft hand when they were given myleran these anomalies take place in humans around day 41 of gestation  there are several classifications for cleft hand but the most used classification is described by manske and halikis  see table 3 this classification is based on the first web space the first web space is the space between the thumb and the index table 3 classification for cleft hand described by manske and halikis the treatment of cleft hand is usually invasive and can differ each time because of the heterogeneity of the condition the function of a cleft hand is mostly not restricted yet improving the function is one of the goals when the thumb or first webspace is absent the social and stigmatising aspects of a cleft hand require more attention the hand is a part of the body which is usually shown during communication when this hand is obviously different and deformed stigmatisation or rejection can occur sometimes in families with cleft hand with good function operations for cosmetic aspects are considered marginal  and the families choose not to have surgery surgical treatment of the cleft hand is based on several indications  improving function aesthetical aspects the timing of surgical interventions is debatable parents have to decide about their child in a very vulnerable time of their parenthood indications for early treatment are progressive deformities such as syndactyly between index and thumb or transverse bones between the digital rays  other surgical interventions are less urgent and can wait for 1 or 2 years when surgery is indicated the choice of treatment is based on the classification table 4 shows the treatment of cleft hand divided into the classification of manske and halikis techniques described by ueba miura and komada and the procedure of snowlittler are guidelines since clinical and anatomical presentation within the types differ the actual treatment is based on the individual abnormality table 4 treatment based on the classification of manske and halikis the goal of this procedure is to create a wide first web space and to minimise the cleft in the hand the index digit will be transferred to the ulnar side of the cleft simultaneously a correction of index malrotation and deviation is performed  to minimise the cleft it is necessary to fix together the metacarpals which used to border the cleft through repositioning flaps the wound can be closed ueba described a less complicated surgery  transverse flaps are used to resurface the palm the dorsal side of the transposed digit and the ulnar part of the first web space a tendon graft is used to connect the common extensor tendons of the border digits of the cleft to prevent digital separation during extension the closure is simpler but has cosmetic disadvantage because of the switch between palmar and dorsal skin the release of the first webspace has the same principle as the snowlittler procedure the difference is the closure of the first webspace this is done by simple closure or closure with zplasties  literature shows that cleft hand is described centuries ago the first reference to what might be considered a cleft hand was by ambroise paré in 1575 hartsink 1770 wrote the first report of true cleft hand in 1896 the first operation of the cleft hand was performed by doctor charles n dowed of new york city  however the first certain description of what we know as a cleft hand as we know it today was described at the end 19th century  historically a utype cleft hand was also known as atypical cleft hand the classification in which typical and atypical cleft hand are described was mostly used for clinical aspects and is shown in table 1 however nowadays this atypical cleft hand is referred to as symbrachydactyly and is not a subtype of cleft hand ectrodactyly is not only a genetic characteristic in humans but can also occur in frogs and toads  mice  salamanders  cows  chickens  rabbits  marmosets  cats and dogs  and even west indian manatees  the following examples are studies showing the natural occurrence of ectrodactyly in animals without the disease being reproduced and tested in a laboratory in all three examples we see how rare the actual occurrence of ectrodactyly is the department of biological sciences at the university of alberta in edmonton alberta performed a study to estimate deformity levels in wood frogs in areas of relatively low disturbance  after roughly 22733 individuals were examined during field studies it was found that only 49 wood frogs had the ectrodactyly deformity  in a study performed by the department of forestry and natural resources at purdue university approximately 2000 salamanders 687 adults and 1259 larvae were captured from a large wetland complex and evaluated for malformations  among the 687 adults 54 79 were malformed of these 54 adults 46 85 had missing ectrodactyly extra polyphalangy or dwarfed digits brachydactyly  among the 1259 larvae 102 were malformed with 94 92 of the malformations involving ectrodactyly polyphalangy and brachydactyly  results showed few differences in the frequency of malformations among lifehistory changes suggesting that malformed larvae do not suffer substantially higher mortality than their adult conspecifics  davis and barry 1977 tested allele frequencies in domestic cats among the 265 cats observed there were 101 males and 164 females only one cat was recorded to have the ectrodactyly abnormality  illustrating this rare disease according to mp ferreira a case of ectrodactyly was found in a twomonthold male mixed terrier dog  in another study carrig and coworkers also reported a series of 14 dogs  with this abnormality proving that although ectrodactyly is an uncommon occurrence for dogs it is not entirely unheard of in this video we can see lord lokhraed guitarist and vocalist of french black metal band nocturnal depression affected by ectrodactyly on the right hand playing electric guitar

V holoprosencephaly hpe once known as arhinencephaly is a cephalic disorder in which the prosencephalon the forebrain of the embryo fails to develop into two hemispheres normally the forebrain is formed and the face begins to develop in the fifth and sixth weeks of human pregnancy the condition also occurs in other species the condition can be mild or severe according to the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds in most cases of holoprosencephaly the malformations are so severe that babies die before birth  when the embryos forebrain does not divide to form bilateral cerebral hemispheres the left and right halves of the brain it causes defects in the development of the face and in brain structure and function in less severe cases babies are born with normal or nearnormal brain development and facial deformities that may affect the eyes nose and upper lip   symptoms of holoprosencephaly range from mild no facialorgan defects anosmia or only a single central incisor to moderate to severe cyclopia there are three classifications of holoprosencephaly holoprosencephaly consists of a spectrum of defects or malformations of the brain and face at the most severe end of this spectrum are cases involving serious malformations of the brain malformations so severe that they often cause miscarriage or stillbirth at the other end of the spectrum are individuals with facial defectswhich may affect the eyes nose and upper lip  and normal or nearnormal brain development seizures and mental retardation may occur the most severe of the facial defects or anomalies is cyclopia an abnormality characterized by the development of a single eye located in the area normally occupied by the root of the nose and a missing nose or a nose in the form of a proboscis a tubular appendage located above the eye the condition is also referred to as cyclocephaly or synophthalmia and is very rare the exact causes of hpe are yet to be determined mutations in the gene encoding the sonic hedgehog protein which is involved in the development of the central nervous system cns can cause holoprosencephaly in other cases it often seems that there is no specific cause at all  armand marie leroi describes the cause of cyclopia as a genetic malfunctioning during the process by which the embryonic brain is divided into two  only later does the visual cortex take recognizable form and at this point an individual with a single forebrain region will be likely to have a single possibly rather large eye at such a time individuals with separate cerebral hemispheres would form two eyes increases in expression of such genes as pax2 as well as inhibition of pax6 from the notochord have been implicated in normal differentiation of cephalic midline structures inappropriate expression of any of these genes may result in mild to severe forms of holoprosencephaly  other candidate genes have been located including the shh holoprosencephaly type 3 aka hpe3 tgif zic2 and six3 genes  although many children with holoprosencephaly have normal chromosomes specific chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in some patients trisomy of chromosome 13 also known as patau syndrome there is evidence that in some families hpe is inherited autosomal dominant as well as autosomal or xlinked recessive inheritance  features consistent with familial transmission of the disease eg a single central maxillary incisor should be carefully assessed in parents and family members numerous possible risk factors have been identified including gestational diabetes transplacental infections the torch complex first trimester bleeding and a history of miscarriage   as well the disorder is found twice as often in female babies  however there appears to be no correlation between hpe and maternal age  there is evidence of a correlation between hpe and the use of various drugs classified as being potentially unsafe for pregnant and lactating mothers these include insulin birth control pills aspirin lithium thorazine retinoic acid and anticonvulsants  there is also a correlation between alcohol consumption and hpe along with nicotine the toxins in cigarettes and toxins in cigarette smoke when used during pregnancy  hpe is not a condition in which the brain deteriorates over time although serious seizure disorders autonomic dysfunction complicated endocrine disorders and other lifethreatening conditions may sometimes be associated with hpe the mere presence of hpe does not mean that these serious problems will occur or develop over time without any previous indication or warning these abnormalities are usually recognized shortly after birth or early in life and only occur if areas of the brain controlling those functions are fused malformed or absent prognosis is dependent upon the degree of fusion and malformation of the brain as well as other health complications that may be present the more severe forms of encephalopathy are usually fatal this disorder consists of a spectrum of defects malformations and associated abnormalities disability is based upon the degree in which the brain is affected moderate to severe defects may cause mental retardation spastic quadriparesis athetoid movements endocrine disorders epilepsy and other serious conditions mild brain defects may only cause learning or behavior problems with few motor impairments seizures may develop over time with the highest risk before 2 years of age and the onset of puberty most are managed with one medication or a combination of medications typically seizures that are difficult to control appear soon after birth requiring more aggressive medication combinationsdoses most children with hpe are at risk of having elevated blood sodium levels during moderatesevere illnesses that alter fluid intakeoutput even if they have no previous diagnosis of diabetes insipidus or hypernatremia

V ring chromosome 14 syndrome is a very rare human chromosome abnormality it occurs when one or both of the telomeres that mark the ends of chromosome 14 are lost allowing the now uncapped ends to fuse together forming a ring chromosome it causes a number of serious health issues most notably recurrent treatmentresistant seizures and intellectual disability    the syndrome is caused by the loss of genetic material near the end of the long arm q of chromosome 14  the break that causes the telomeres to be lost almost never occurs exactly at the end of the chromosome instead it occurs further up and several critical genes near the end of the chromosome are lost ring chromosome 14 syndrome is almost never inherited the genetic abnormality occurs randomly in sperm or egg cells or it may occur in early embryonic growth if it occurs during embryonic growth the ring chromosome may be present in only some of a persons cells ie mosaicism the most common symptoms are intellectual disability and recurrent seizures developing in infancy or early childhood typically the seizures are resistant to treatment with antiepileptic drugs many individuals exhibit slow growth being smaller and shorter than their peers other symptoms may include diagnosis is achieved by examining the structure of the chromosomes through karyotyping because of the possibility that not all cells carry the ring chromosome the karyotype analysis should examine a sufficient number of cells ring chromosome 14 syndrome is extremely rare the true rate of occurrence is unknown but there are at least 50 documented cases in the literature

V medullary sponge kidney also known as cacchiricci disease is a congenital disorder of the kidneys characterized by cystic dilatation of the collecting tubules in one or both kidneys individuals with medullary sponge kidney are at increased risk for kidney stones and urinary tract infection patients with msk typically pass twice as many stones per year as do other stone formers without msk while described as a benign disorder with a low morbidity rate as many as 10 of patients with msk have an increased risk of morbidity associated with frequent stones and utis while some patients report increased chronic kidney pain the source of the pain when a uti or blockage is not present is unclear at this time renal colic flank and back pain is present in 55 of patients women with msk experience more stones utis and complications than men msk was previously believed not to be hereditary but there is more evidence coming forth that may indicate otherwise     in recent studies insight has been obtained on the genetic basis of this disease supporting the hypothesis that msk is due to a disruption at the ureteric budmetanephric mesenchyme interface this explains why so many tubular defects coexist in this disease and particularly a distal tubular acidification defect of which the highly prevalent metabolic bone disease is one very important consequence in addition to the typical clinical phenotype of recurrent stone disease other clinical profiles have now been recognized that is an indolent almost asymptomatic msk and a rare form characterized by intractable excruciating pain  it was previously believed that most cases of medullary sponge kidney were sporadic however recent studies show familial clustering of msk is common and has an autosomal dominant inheritance a reduced penetrance and variable expressivity   other theories suggest that dilatation of a collecting duct may occur caused by occlusion by uric acid during fetal life or resulting from tubular obstruction due to calcium oxalate calculi secondary to infantile hypercalciuria  a rare autosomal recessive form is associated with caroli disease  in the general population the frequency of medullary sponge kidney disease is reported to be 0020005 that is 1 in 5000 to 1 in 20000 the frequency of medullary sponge kidney has been reported by various authors to be 12 21 in patients with kidney stones nephrolithiasis  the disease is bilateral in 70 of cases most cases are asymptomatic or are discovered during investigation of hematuria symptomatic patients typically present as middle aged adults with renal colic nephrolithiasis nephrocalcinosis andor recurrent urinary tract infections however msk also may affect children very rarely in addition to the typical clinical phenotype of recurrent stone disease other clinical profiles have now been recognized that is an indolent almost asymptomatic msk and a rare form characterized by intractable pain  classically msk is seen as hyperdense papillae with clusters of small stones on renal ultrasonography or abdominal xray the irregular ectatic collecting ducts often seen in msk which are sometimes described as having a paintbrushlike appearance are best seen on intravenous urography however iv urography has been largely replaced by contrastenhanced highresolution helical ct with digital reconstruction  often aggressive treatment is unnecessary for people with disease that does not cause any symptoms asymptomatic  in such cases treatment may consist of maintaining adequate fluid intake with the goal of decreasing the risk of developing kidney stones nephrolithiasis  cases of recurrent kidney stone formation may warrant evaluation for possible underlying metabolic abnormalities  in patients with low levels of citrate in the urine hypocitraturia and incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis treatment with potassium citrate helps prevent the formation of new kidney stones  urinary tract infections when they occur should also be treated  patients with the more rare form of msk marked by chronic pain typically require pain management nonobstructing stones in msk can be associated with significant and chronic pain even if theyre not passing the pain in this situation can be constant it is not certain what causes this pain but researchers have proposed that the small numerous stones seen in msk may cause obstruction of the small tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney which could lead to the pain this pain can often be debilitating and treatment is challenging narcotic medication even with large quantities is sometimes not adequate some success with pain control has been reported using laser lithotripsy called ureteroscopic laser papillotomy  complications associated with medullary sponge kidney include the following many patients with msk find support in online support groups msk awareness colors are purple teal and green

V a supernumerary nipple also known as a third nipple triple nipple accessory nipple  polythelia or the related condition polymastia is an additional nipple occurring in mammals including humans often mistaken for moles supernumerary nipples are diagnosed in humans at a rate of approximately 1 in 3 males  and 1 in 17 females   the nipples appear along the two vertical milk lines which start in the armpit on each side run down through the typical nipples and end at the groin they are classified into eight levels of completeness from a simple patch of hair to a milkbearing breast in miniature   polythelia refers to the presence of an additional nipple alone while polymastia denotes the much rarer presence of additional mammary glands although usually presenting on the milk line pseudomamma can appear as far away as the foot  a possible relationship with mitral valve prolapse has been proposed    the triple nipple club is a documentary shown on channel 4 which explored the biological mystery of the supernumerary nipple  first broadcast on 2 january 2008 it was directed and produced by dan louw and commissioned as part of channel 4s first cut series  the film focuses on louws attempts to understand why he was born with extra nipples a condition he shares with the likes of mark wahlberg  lily allen  and tilda swinton as well as well known tv and film characters such as scaramanga and chandler bing fascinated and confused by this seemingly pointless mutation louw sets off on a personal journey of discovery to try and unwrap the riddle of the triple nipple he starts out by consulting the man in the street and even a renowned teratologist an expert in physical mutations after testing the notion that extra nipples could be a sign of fertility he discovers that they are actually an atavism or evolutionary holdover  a sign of how humans evolved

V temozolomide tmz brand names temodar and temodal and temcad is an oral chemotherapy drug it is an alkylating agent used as a treatment of some brain cancers as a secondline treatment for astrocytoma and a firstline treatment for glioblastoma multiforme     the most common nonhematological adverse effects associated with temozolomide  nausea and vomiting  are either selflimiting or readily controlled with standard antiemetic therapy these effects are usually mild to moderate grade 1 to 2 the incidence of severe nausea and vomiting is around 4 each patients who have preexisting or a history of severe vomiting may require antiemetic therapy before initiating temozolomide treatment temozolomide should be administered in the fasting state at least one hour before a meal capsules must not be opened or chewed but swallowed whole with a glass of water antiemetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of temozolomide temozolomide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to its components or to dacarbazine the use of temozolomide is not recommended in patients with severe myelosuppression temozolomide is genotoxic teratogenic and fetotoxic and should not be used during pregnancy lactating women should discontinue nursing while receiving the drug because of the risk of secretion into breast milk one study indicated that women that have taken temozolomide without concomitant fertility preservation measures achieve pregnancy to a lesser rate later in life but the study was too small to show statistical significance in the hypothesis that temozolomide would confer a risk of female infertility  in male patients temozolomide can have genotoxic effects men are advised not to father a child during or up to six months after treatment and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to temozolomide therapy very rarely temozolomide can cause acute respiratory failure the therapeutic benefit of temozolomide depends on its ability to alkylatemethylate dna which most often occurs at the n7 or o6 positions of guanine residues this methylation damages the dna and triggers the death of tumor cells however some tumor cells are able to repair this type of dna damage and therefore diminish the therapeutic efficacy of temozolomide by expressing a protein o alkylguanine dna alkyltransferase agt encoded in humans by the o6methylguaninedna methyltransferase mgmt gene  in some tumors epigenetic silencing of the mgmt gene prevents the synthesis of this enzyme and as a consequence such tumors are more sensitive to killing by temozolomide  conversely the presence of agt protein in brain tumors predicts poor response to temozolomide and these patients receive little benefit from chemotherapy with temozolomide  temozolomide is a prodrug and an imidazotetrazine derivative of the alkylating agent dacarbazine  the agent was developed by malcolm stevens and his team at aston university in birmingham    it has been available in the us since august 1999 and in other countries since the early 2000s  laboratory studies and clinical trials are investigating whether it might be possible to further increase the anticancer potency of temozolomide by combining it with other pharmacologic agents for example clinical trials have indicated that the addition of chloroquine might be beneficial for the treatment of glioma patients  in laboratory studies it was found that temozolomide killed brain tumor cells more efficiently when epigallocatechin gallate egcg a component of green tea was added however the efficacy of this effect has not yet been confirmed in brain tumor patients  more recently use of the novel oxygen diffusionenhancing compound trans sodium crocetinate tsc when combined with temozolomide and radiation therapy has been investigated in preclinical studies   and a clinical trial is currently underway  while the abovementioned approaches have investigated whether the combination of temozolomide with other agents might improve therapeutic outcome there are also efforts underway to study whether the temozolomide molecule itself can be altered in order to further increase its activity in one such approach perillyl alcohol a natural compound with demonstrated therapeutic activity in brain cancer patients  was permanently fused to the temozolomide molecule this novel compound called neo212 or tmzpoh revealed anticancer activity that was significantly greater than that of either of its two parent molecules temozolomide and perillyl alcohol although neo212 has not yet been tested in humans it did show superior cancer therapeutic activity in animal models of glioma  melanoma  and brain metastasis of triplenegative breast cancer  because tumor cells that express the mgmt gene are more resistant to killing by temozolomide it was investigated whether the inclusion of o6benzylguanine o bg an agt inhibitor would be able to overcome this resistance and improve the drugs therapeutic effectiveness in the laboratory this combination indeed showed increased temozolomide activity in tumor cell culture in vitro and in animal models in vivo  however a recently completed phaseii clinical trial with brain tumor patients yielded mixed outcomes while there was some improved therapeutic activity when o bg and temozolomide were given to patients with temozolomideresistant anaplastic glioma there seemed to be no significant restoration of temozolomide sensitivity in patients with temozolomideresistant glioblastoma multiforme  there are also efforts to engineer hematopoietic stem cells expressing the mgmt gene prior to transplanting them into brain tumor patients this would allow for the patients to receive stronger doses of temozolomide since the patients hematopoietic cells would be resistant to the drug  high doses of temozolomide in high grade gliomas have low toxicity but the results are comparable to the standard doses

V vein of galen aneurysmal malformations vgam and vein of galen aneurysmal dilations vgad are the most frequent arteriovenous malformations in infants and fetuses   vgam consisted of a tangled mass of dilated vessels supplied by an enlarged artery  the malformation increases greatly in size with age although the mechanism of the increase is unknown  dilation of the great cerebral vein of galen is a secondary result of the force of arterial blood either directly from an artery via an arteriovenous fistula or by way of a tributary vein that receives the blood directly from an artery   there is usually a venous anomaly downstream from the draining vein that together with the high blood flow into the great cerebral vein of galen causes its dilation  the right sided cardiac chambers and pulmonary arteries also develop mild to severe dilation    five patterns of galenic arteriovenous malformations have been described these malformations develop in utero by the persistence of fistulae between primitive pia arachnoidal arteries and pial veins that cross each other at right angles  because the primitive galenic system and the primitive choroidal system lie close together an arteriovenous malformation involving the primitive choroidal system will inevitably involve the galenic vein  larger arteriovenous shunts correlate with greater hemodynamic effects and earlier symptom onset small arteriovenous shunts correlate with greater local mass effect causing progressive neurological impairment  malformations often lead to cardiac failure cranial bruits pattern 1 hydrocephaly and subarachnoid hemorrhage in neonates  the heart failure is due to the size of the arteriovenous shunt that can steal 80 or more of the cardiac output with large volumes of blood under high pressure returning to the right heart and pulmonary circulation and sinus venosus atrial septal defects   it is also the most common cause of death in such patients  nondevelopmental syndromes also directly or indirectly affect the great cerebral vein of galen although they are extremely rare these include superior vena cava syndrome svcs and thrombosis of the lateral sinus superior sagittal sinus internal jugular vein or of the great cerebral vein of galen itself testing for a malformed vein of galen is indicated when a patient has heart failure which has no obvious cause  diagnosis is generally achieved by signs such as cranial bruits and symptoms such as expanded facial veins  the vein of galen can be visualized using ultrasound or doppler  a malformed great cerebral vein will be noticeably enlarged ultrasound is a particularly useful tool for vein of galen malformations because so many cases occur in infancy and ultrasound can make diagnoses prenatally many cases are diagnosed only during autopsy as congestive heart failure occurs very early  treatment depends on the anatomy of the malformation as determined by angiography or magnetic resonance imaging mri  head circumference measurements should be obtained regularly and monitored carefully to detect hydrocephalus neurosurgical procedures to relieve hydrocephalus are important a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be required in some infants a pediatric cardiologist should be consulted to manage highoutput failure if present often patients need to be intubated in most cases the fistulous arteries feeding into the vein of galen must be blocked thereby reducing the blood flow into the vein  open surgery has a high morbidity and mortality recent advances over the past few decades have made endovascular embolization the preferred method of treatment these treatments are preferred because they offer little threat to the surrounding brain tissue however there have been several reported cases of arteriovenous malformations recurring  the young age of many patients the complex vascular anatomy and the sensitive location of the vein of galen offer considerable challenges to surgeons  another treatment option is radiotherapy radiotherapy also called radiosurgery involves the use of focused beams to damage the blood vessel  radiotherapy is often not pursued as a treatment because the effects of the procedure can take months or years and there is risk of damaging adjacent brain tissue  surgery is not always an option when the anatomy of the malformation creates too much of a risk recent improvements in endovascular procedures have made many cases which were not surgically accessible treatable  endovascular treatments involve delivering drugs balloons or coils to the site of the malformation through blood vessels via catheters  these treatments work by limiting blood flow through the vein there is however still risk of complications from endovascular treatments the wall of the vein can be damaged during the procedure and in some cases the emboli can become dislodged and travel through the vascular system  twodimensional echocardiography with colorflow imaging and pulsed doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate one fetus and five neonates with a vein of galen malformation  colorflow imaging and pulsed doppler ultrasonography provided anatomical and pathophysiological information regarding cardiac hemodynamics and intracranial blood flow with the patients clinical status these methods provided a reliable noninvasive means to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and the need for further treatment in neonates with vein of galen malformations  when none of these procedures are viable shunting can be used to ameliorate the pressure inside the varix  seizures usually are managed with antiepileptic medications  the complications that are usually associated with vein of galen malformations are usually intracranial hemorrhages  over half the patients with vgam have a malformation that cannot be corrected patients frequently die in the neonatal period or in early infancy  vein of galen malformations are devastating complications studies have shown that 77 of untreated cases result in mortality  even after surgical treatment the mortality rate remains as high as 394  most cases occur during infancy when the mortality rates are at their highest vein of galen malformations are a relatively unknown affliction attributed to the rareness of the malformations therefore when a child is diagnosed with a faulty great cerebral vein of galen most parents know little to nothing about what they are dealing with to counteract this support sites have been created which offer information advice and a community of support to the afflicted 1 2

V muenke syndrome also known as fgfr3related craniosynostosis  is a human specific condition characterized by the premature closure of certain bones of the skull during development which affects the shape of the head and face first described by maximilian muenke the syndrome occurs in about 1 in 30000 newborns this condition accounts for an estimated 8 percent of all cases of craniosynostosis   many people with this disorder have a premature fusion of skull bones along the coronal suture not every case has had craniosynostosis however other parts of the skull may be malformed as well this will usually cause an abnormally shaped head wideset eyes low set ears and flattened cheekbones in these patients about 5 percent of affected individuals have an enlarged head macrocephaly there may also be associated hearing loss in 1033 of cases and it is important for affected individuals to have hearing tests to check on the possibility of a problem they can lose about 33100 of hearing most people with this condition have normal intellect but developmental delay and learning disabilities are possible the signs and symptoms of muenke syndrome vary among affected people and some findings overlap with those seen in other craniosynostosis syndromes between 6 percent and 7 percent of people with the gene mutation associated with muenke syndrome do not have any of the characteristic features of the disorder muenke syndrome is caused by a specific gene mutation in the fgfr3 gene the mutation arises randomly there is no full understanding for what causes this mutation this mutation causes the fgfr3 protein to be overly active it interferes with normal bone growth and allows skull bones to fuse prematurely there is no connection between anything mother did or did not do to activate the syndrome if neither of the parents have muenke syndrome chances of having another child with the syndrome are minimal this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern this means if a parent has muenke syndrome every newborn has a 50 chance of inheriting the syndrome muenke syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in some cases an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent if a patient is shown to have muenke they have a 5050 chance of passing it on to their children not all cases of muenke however is obvious other cases may result from new mutations in the gene these cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family a single mutation in the fgfr3 gene cause this syndrome the fgfr3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue this mutation causes the fgfr3 protein to be overly active which interferes with normal bone growth and allows the bones of the skull to fuse before they should as stated by researchers at the university of washington muenke syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the defining mutation has been identified in the family agochukwu etal 2006 according to the article craniosynostosis molecular genetics penetrance is higher in females 87 than in males 76 muenke syndrome is estimated to account for 2530 of all genetic causes of craniosynostosis according to the journal of anatomy the diagnosis of muenke syndrome is suspected bases on abnormal skull shape and a diagnosis of coronal craniosynostosis in 2006 agochukwu and his colleagues concluded that a distinct muenke syndrome phenotype includes uni or bilateral coronal synostosis midface hypoplasia broad toes and brachydactyly due to phenotypic overlap andor mild phenotypes clinical differentiation of this syndrome may be difficult the suspected diagnosis is confirmed by a blood test to check for gene mutation to establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with muenke syndrome various evaluations are recommended apart from craniosynostosis it has been suggested that hearing loss and learning difficulties are common in muenke syndrome according to ulster medical journal most individuals with muenke syndrome may have limb findings the most common ocular finding in muenke syndrome is strabismus as studied by agochukwu and his researching team the treatment of muenke syndrome is focused on the correction of the abnormal skull shape and mirrors the treatment of coronal craniosynostosis the abnormal growth patterns continue throughout the growing years therefore intervention accurate diagnosis and a customized expertly carriedout treatment plan should be a primary concern the treatment of muenke syndrome is focused on correction of the abnormal skull shape and mirrors the treatment of nonsyndromic coronal craniosynostosis although the timing of surgery can be highly individualized surgical correction of the bicoronal craniosynostosis is most often done between 6 and 12 months of age surgery is usually performed through a scalp incision that lies concealed within the hair of the head your craniofacial surgeon will work in concert with a pediatric neurosurgeon in order to safely remove the bones of the skull then the craniofacial surgeon reshapes and repositions those bones to give a more normal skull shape edar edar hypohidrotic ectodermal

V fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva fop is an extremely rare connective tissue disease the disease is caused by a mutation of the bodys repair mechanism which causes fibrous tissue including muscle tendon and ligament to be ossified spontaneously or when damaged in many cases injuries can cause joints to become permanently frozen in place surgical removal of the extra bone growths has been shown to cause the body to repair the affected area with even more bone   for unknown reasons children born with fop have deformed big toes possibly missing a joint or simply presenting with a notable lump at the minor joint the first flareup that leads to the formation of fop bones usually occurs before the age of 10 the bone growth progresses from the top downward just as bones grow in fetuses a child with fop will typically develop bones starting at the neck then on the shoulders arms chest area and finally on the feet specifically fop involvement is typically seen first in the dorsal axial cranial and proximal regions of the body later the disease progresses in the ventral appendicular caudal and distal regions of the body  however it does not necessarily occur in this order due to injurycaused flareups often the tumorlike lumps that characterize the disease appear suddenly this condition causes loss of mobility to affected joints including inability to fully open the mouth limiting speech and eating extra bone formation around the rib cage restricts the expansion of lungs and diaphragm causing breathing complications since the disease is so rare the symptoms are often misdiagnosed as cancer or fibrosis this leads physicians to order biopsies which can exacerbate the growth of these lumps however those born with fop tend to have malformed toes or thumbs which help distinguish this disorder from other skeletal problems  fop is caused by an autosomal dominant allele on chromosome 2q2324  the allele has variable expressivity but complete penetrance most cases are caused by spontaneous mutation in the gametes most people with fop cannot or choose not to have children a similar but less catastrophic disease is fibrous dysplasia which is caused by a postzygotic mutation a mutation in the gene acvr1 also known as activinlike kinase 2 alk2 is responsible for the disease  acvr1 encodes activin receptor type1 a bmp type1 receptor the mutation causes substitution of codon 206 from arginine to histidine in the acvr1 protein   this substitution causes abnormal activation of acvr1 leading to the transformation of connective tissue and muscle tissue into a secondary skeleton this causes endothelial cells to transform to mesenchymal stem cells and then to bone  fop is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects individuals who are heterozygous with a homozygous recessive partner therefore their children will have 50 chance of being affected two affected individuals can produce unaffected children the phenotypes of those who are homozygous dominant have more severe effects compared to those with heterozygous phenotype  the gene that causes ossification is normally deactivated after a fetuss bones are formed in the womb but in patients with fop the gene keeps working aberrant bone formation in patients with fop occurs when injured connective tissue or muscle cells at the sites of injury or growth incorrectly express an enzyme for bone repair during apoptosis selfregulated cell death resulting in lymphocytes containing excess bone morphogenetic protein 4 bmp4 provided during the immune system response the bone that results occurs independently of the normal skeleton forming its own discrete skeletal elements these elements however can fuse with normal skeletal bone  interestingly the diaphragm tongue and extraocular muscles are spared in this process as well as cardiac and smooth muscle  since the incorrect enzyme remains unresolved within the immune response the body continues providing the incorrect bmp4containing lymphocytes bmp4 is a product that contributes to the development of the skeleton in the normal embryo  dna sequencing electropherograms of a typical fop patient can differ when being compared to two other patients the acvr1 gene encodes a bone morphogenic protein bmp receptor this gene is mutated in fop this protein is responsible for growth and development of bone and muscles scientists theorize that a mutation in the acvr1 changes the shape of the receptor and disrupts certain mechanisms that control the receptors activity there is a certain molecule otherwise known as ligands that binds at the site to cause this reaction to activate with which it forms a complex due to the mutation however the bind site is modified and no longer stops the reaction  the end result is an overgrowth of bone and cartilage and fusion of joints  this type of genetic disorder is so rare that only 1 in 2 million people worldwide acquire it as it is such a rare disorder only a few are reported at all most of the cases of fop were results of a new gene mutation these people had no history of this particular disorder in their family there are some cases which have shown people inheriting the mutation from one affected parent  outbreaks may be measurable clinically by elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and bonespecific alkaline phosphatase  there is no cure or approved treatment for fop  attempts to surgically remove the bone result in explosive bone growth  while under anesthesia people with fop may encounter difficulties with intubation restrictive pulmonary disease and changes in the electrical conduction system of the heart  activities that increase the risk of falling or soft tissue injury should be avoided as even minor trauma may provoke heterotopic bone formation detailed treatment guidelines can be accessed at httpwwwifopaorgtreatmentguidelineshtml as of 2008 approximately 700 cases of fop have been confirmed worldwide making fop one of the rarest known diseases  the estimated incidence of fop is 061 cases per million people and affects all races  medical reports describing individuals affected by fop date back as far as the seventeenth century  fop was originally called myositis ossificans progresiva and was thought to be caused by muscular inflammation myositis that caused bone formation  the disease was renamed by victor a mckusick in 1970 following the discovery that soft tissue other than muscles eg ligaments were also affected by the disease process  the best known fop case is that of harry eastlack 19331973 his condition began to develop at the age of ten and by the time of his death from pneumonia in november 1973 six days before his 40th birthday his body had completely ossified leaving him able to move only his lips shortly before eastlacks death he made it known that he wanted to donate his body to science in the hope that in death he would be able to help find a cure for this littleunderstood and particularly cruel disease pursuant to his wishes his preserved skeleton is now kept at the mütter museum in philadelphia and has proven to be an invaluable source of information in the study of fop clinical trials of isotretinoin etidronate with oral corticosteroids and perhexiline maleate have failed to demonstrate effectiveness though the variable course of the disease and small prevalence induces uncertainty  a handful of pharmaceutical companies focused on rare disease are currently in varying stages of investigation into different therapeutic approaches for fop in august 2015 us food and drug administration fda office of orphan products development granted la jolla pharmaceuticals orphan drug designation for two novel compounds for fop the compounds are smallmolecule bmp kinase inhibitors designed to selectively block a specific member of the bone morphogenetic protein bmp typei receptor family alk2  in august 2015 clementia pharmaceuticals also began the enrollment of children ages 6 and above into its phase ii clinical trial investigating palovarotene for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva fop  preclinical studies demonstrated that palovarotene a retinoic acid receptor gamma agonist blocked abnormal bone formation in animal models via inhibition of secondary messenger systems in the bmp pathway  clementia licensed palovarotene from roche pharmaceuticals which previously evaluated the compound in more than 800 individuals including healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease palovarotene received fast track designation from the us food and drug administration fda and orphan designations for the treatment of fop from both the fda and the european medicines agency ema  in september 2015 regeneron announced new insight into the mechanism of disease involving the activation of the acvr1 receptor by activin a though the company did not disclose details or timing of its development approach for an activin a antibody it reported that preclinical testing is ongoing  another potential therapeutic approach involves allelespecific rna interference that targets mutated mrna for degradation while preserving normal acvr1 gene expression  further investigation into the mechanisms of heterotopic bone formation in fop could aid in the development of treatments for other disorders involving extraskeletal bone formation

V cephalic disorders from the greek word \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 meaning head are congenital conditions that stem from damage to or abnormal development of the budding nervous system cephalic means head or head end of the body cephalic disorders are not necessarily caused by a single factor but may be influenced by hereditary or genetic conditions nutritional deficiencies or by environmental exposures during pregnancy such as medication taken by the mother maternal infection or exposure to radiation such disorders are more common in areas of the former soviet union affected by nuclear waste disposal problems such as the area around the mayak plant in chelyabinsk russia  some cephalic disorders occur when the cranial sutures the fibrous joints that connect the bones of the skull join prematurely most cephalic disorders are caused by a disturbance that occurs very early in the development of the fetal nervous system the human nervous system develops from a small specialized plate of cells on the surface of the embryo early in development this plate of cells forms the neural tube a narrow sheath that closes between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy to form the brain and spinal cord of the embryo four main processes are responsible for the development of the nervous system cell proliferation the process in which nerve cells divide to form new generations of cells cell migration the process in which nerve cells move from their place of origin to the place where they will remain for life cell differentiation the process during which cells acquire individual characteristics and cell death a natural process in which cells die damage to the developing nervous system is a major cause of chronic disabling disorders and sometimes death in infants children and even adults the degree to which damage to the developing nervous system harms the mind and body varies enormously many disabilities are mild enough to allow those afflicted to eventually function independently in society others are not some infants children and adults die others remain totally disabled and an even larger population is partially disabled functioning well below normal capacity throughout life the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds is currently conducting and supporting research on normal and abnormal brain and nervous system development     where known the icd10 code is listed below portions of this article were based on the page httpwwwnindsnihgovdisorderscephalicdisordersdetailcephalicdisordershtm at the national institute of neurological disorders and strokes public domain resource

V splenogonadal fusion is a rare congenital malformation that results from an abnormal connection between the primitive spleen and gonad during gestation a portion of the splenic tissue then descends with the gonad splenogonadal fusion has been classified into two types continuous where there remains a connection between the main spleen and gonad and discontinuous where ectopic splenic tissue is attached to the gonad but there is no connection to the orthotopic spleen patients with continuous splenogonadal fusion frequently have additional congenital abnormalities most commonly cryptorchidism  the anomaly was first described in 1883 by bostroem  since then more than 150 cases of splenogonadal fusion have been documented  the condition is considered benign  a few cases of testicular neoplasm have been reported in association with splenogonadal fusion   the reported cases have occurred in patients with a history of cryptorchidism which is associated with an elevated risk of neoplasm  splenogonadal fusion occurs with a maletofemale ratio of 161 and is seen nearly exclusively on the left side  the condition remains a diagnostic challenge but preoperative consideration of the diagnosis may help avoid unnecessary orchiectomy on scrotal ultrasound ectopic splenic tissue may appear as an encapsulated homogeneous extratesticular mass isoechoic with the normal testis subtle hypoechoic nodules may be present in the mass  the presence of splenic tissue may be confirmed with a technetium99m sulfur colloid scan

V pancreas or pancreatic divisum is a congenital anomaly in the anatomy of the ducts of the pancreas in which a single pancreatic duct is not formed but rather remains as two distinct dorsal and ventral ducts   the human embryo begins life with two ducts in the pancreas the ventral duct and the dorsal duct normally the two ducts will fuse together to form one main pancreatic duct this occurs in more than 90 of embryos in approximately 10 of embryos the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse together resulting in pancreas divisum in utero the majority of the pancreas is drained by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor papilla the ventral duct drains the minority of the pancreas and opens into the major papilla in adults however this situation is reversed whereby 70 of the pancreas is drained by the ventral duct therefore in pancreas divisum where fusion of the ducts does not occur the major drainage of the pancreas is done by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor papilla a majority of individuals born with pancreas divisum will not have symptoms in some cases pancreas divisum is only detected during autopsy  a small group of individuals will develop symptoms which commonly include abdominal pain nausea vomiting and acute and chronic pancreatitis  the most common and accurate way of diagnosing an individual with this anomaly is by mrcp magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or ercp endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography this test can demonstrate the presence of two separately draining ducts within the pancreas other tests can assist doctors with diagnosis such as a ct scan and an mri pancreas divisum in individuals with no symptoms does not require treatment treatment of those with symptoms varies and has not been well established a surgeon may attempt a sphincterotomy by cutting the minor papilla to enlarge the opening and allow pancreatic enzymes to flow normally during surgery a stent may be inserted into the duct to ensure that the duct will not close causing a blockage this surgery can cause pancreatitis in patients or in rare cases kidney failure and death an association with adenoma of the minor papilla has been reported

V the sweat test measures the concentration of chloride that is excreted in sweat it is used to screen for cystic fibrosis cf  due to defective chloride channels cftr the concentration of chloride in sweat is elevated in individuals with cf   cystic fibrosis is caused by defects in a protein found in many tissues including the airways and the sweat glands  as a result these tissues do not work properly sweat testing makes use of the fact that cystic fibrosis patients have defective sweat glands  sweat glands produce sweat through a well understood process of secretion and reabsorption of sodium chloride salt secretion entails the movement of salt and water from sweat gland cells into the sweat duct reabsorption occurs in the duct with the movement of salt from the sweat back into sweat duct cells what remains is sweat a salt solution with a relatively finely tuned concentration of sodium and chloride for normal salt reabsorption to occur individual ions of sodium and chloride must be taken from the sweat and moved back into cells of the sweat duct these ions are moved by transporters called ion channels in the case of sodium there is a sodium channel for chloride there is a chloride channel called cftr for sweat to be produced with the proper concentrations of sodium and chloride sodium channels and chloride channels cftrs must work properly in cystic fibrosis the cftr chloride channel is defective and does not allow chloride to be reabsorbed into sweat duct cells consequently more sodium stays in the duct and more chloride remains in the sweat the concentration of chloride in sweat is therefore elevated in individuals with cystic fibrosis the concentration of sodium in sweat is also elevated in cystic fibrosis unlike cftr chloride channels sodium channels behave perfectly normally in cystic fibrosis however in order for the secretion to be electrically neutral positively charged sodium cations remain in the sweat along with the negatively charged chloride anions in this way the chloride anions are said to trap the sodium cations sweating is induced by pilocarpine iontophoresis  at the test site an electrode is placed over gauze containing pilocarpine and electrolyte solution that will not interfere with the sodium and chloride measurement a second electrode without pilocarpine will be placed at another site and a mild electric current will draw the pilocarpine into the skin where it stimulates the sweat glands the test site is carefully cleaned and dried then a piece of preweighed filter paper is placed over the test site and covered with parafilm to prevent evaporation specialized collection devices may also be used sweat is collected for 30 minutes the filter paper is retrieved and weighed to determine the weight of sweat collected several laboratory methods are then used to determine the sodium and chloride concentrations before this method of inducing sweat was developed the method was to place the entire person to be tested in a hemispherical chamber and slowly raise the humidity and temperature of the air inside  for infants up to and including 6 months of age a chloride level of for people older than 6 months of age a chloride level of two reliable positive results on two separate days is diagnostic for cf because of the existence of milder variants borderline or even nearborderline negative results may be used to diagnose cf clinical presentation family history and patient age must be considered to interpret the results highly discordant sodium and chloride values may indicate technical errors technical errors insufficient sample evaporation contamination dehydration mineralocorticoid hormone therapy and skin rash on the tested area may produce incorrect results positive test results may also be caused by malnutrition adrenal insufficiency glycogen storage diseases hypothyroidism hypoparathyroidism nephrogenic diabetes insipidus g6pd deficiency or ectodermal dysplasia

V sirenomelia alternatively known as mermaid syndrome is a very rare congenital deformity in which the legs are fused together giving them the appearance of a mermaids tail this condition is found in approximately one out of every 100000 live births  about as rare as conjoined twins and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of complications associated with abnormal kidney and urinary bladder development and function more than half the cases of sirenomelia result in stillbirth and this condition is 100 times more likely to occur in identical twins than in single births or fraternal twins  it results from a failure of normal vascular supply from the lower aorta in utero  maternal diabetes has been associated with caudal regression syndrome and sirenomelia  although a few sources question this association  vacterlh is an expanded form of the vacterl association that concludes that this diagnosis is a less severe form of sirenomelia  the disorder was formerly thought to be an extreme case of caudal regression syndrome however it was reclassified to be considered a separate condition   only a handful of individuals who did not have fatal kidney and bladder complications are known to have survived beyond birth with this condition tiffany yorks of clearwater florida born may 7 1988 underwent successful surgery in order to separate her legs before she was a year old  she is the longestsurviving sirenomelia patient to date  she currently is enduring mobility issues due to her fragile leg bones she compensates by using crutches or a wheelchair shiloh jade pepin august 4 1999  october 23 2009 was born in kennebunkport maine united states with her lower extremities fused no bladder no uterus no rectum only 6inches of large colon no vagina and with only one quarter of a kidney and one ovary her parents initially anticipated she could expect only a few months of life her natural kidney failed when she was just 3 months old after that she was on dialysis  a kidney transplant at age 2 lasted a number of years and in 2007 a second kidney transplant was successful she attended consolidated elementary school she remained hopeful about her disease and joked often and lived her life happily despite her challenges as seen in her documentary in extraordinary people mermaid girl still there were times when she felt she couldnt bear to be ill any longer shiloh and her family were debating surgery because of the risks involved even though it would improve her quality of life many people who have this disease receive surgery when they are young but shiloh was already 8 years old in the documentary and had not received surgery shiloh was the only one of the three survivors of sirenomelia without surgery for separation of the conjoined legs  she died fighting a serious case of pneumonia on october 23 2009 at maine medical center in portland maine at the age of 10  having appeared on the oprah winfrey show on september 22 2009  shiloh gained a following of admirers by documenting her condition on tv facebook and the internet shiloh was also the main character of the tlc special mermaid girl that was dedicated to her memory seven days later shiloh was laid to rest in west kennebunkport maine at pine grove cemetery next to her stillborn sister molly pepin on october 30 2009 her mother leslie died unexpectedly on october 1 2014 milagros cerrón arauco was born on april 27 2004 in huancayo peru although most of milagros internal organs including her heart and lungs are in perfect condition she was born with serious internal defects including a deformed left kidney and a very small right one located very low in her body in addition her digestive urinary tracts and genitals share a single tube this birth defect occurs during the gastrulation week week 3 of embryonic development gastrulation establishes the three germ layers ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm it seems that complications such as defects in the urogenital system as mentioned above can be possibly due to malformations in the intermediate mesoderm a fourhour operation to insert silicone bags between her legs to stretch the skin was successfully completed on february 8 2005 a successful operation to separate her legs to just above the knee took place may 31 2005 in a solidarity hospital in the district of surquillo in lima the procedure however was so intensive that she became traumatized to the degree of losing her ability to form proper speech patterns leaving her nearly mute it is not yet known if this is a physiological or psychological condition however at milagros second birthday her mother reported that she knew more than 50 words a second operation to complete the separation up to the groin took place on september 7 2006  a few weeks later she took her first steps  her doctor luis rubio said he was pleased with the progress milagros had made but cautioned that she still needed 10 to 15 years of rehabilitation and more operations before she could lead a normal life particularly she will require reconstructive surgery to rebuild her rudimentary anus urethra and genitalia milagros parents are from a poor village in perus andes mountains the solidarity hospital has given a job to her father ricardo cerrón so that the family can remain in lima while the city of lima has pledged to pay for many of the operations

V metascreen metascreen  is an advanced noninvasive metabolic screening test distributed by cordlife group limited cordlife it can detect as many as 110 inborn errors of metabolism iems or metabolic disorders from a urine specimen cordlife owns the brand name and trademark metascreen history metascreen as a newborn metabolic screening test was first launched by cordlife in india in october 2013  since april 2014 metascreen became available also in hong kong and the philippines through cordlife for parents looking for more comprehensive screening of metabolic disorders for their children as a newborn suffering from certain metabolic disorder such as isovaleric acidemia may appear asymptomatic in the first few days or even weeks of life early detection and treatment is key in preventing irreversible lifelong complications such as physical disability or mental retardation   technology unlike the conventional dried blood spot test for newborn screening that involves a painful heel prick  metascreen uses urine specimen collected without harm or discomfort to the newborn to detect as many as 110 metabolic disorders the urine specimen is collected on a filter paper which is then airdried and sent to the laboratory for analysis using a gas chromatographymass spectrometry instrument gcms gcms is a fda approved method for urinary analyte detection a gold standard for lipids drug metabolites and environmental analysis  many of the iems that are classified as organic acidemia in which organic acids accumulate in the urine of newborns with these disorders  are easily and accurately picked up by gcms the gcms platform is recommended by the american college of medical genetics for the detection of organic and amino acidemias through the urine  furthermore the platform has also been shown to be reliable in detecting other types of iems such as sugar metabolism disorders and fatty acid oxidation disorders   indeed gcms analysis is increasingly becoming a common way to diagnose iems for earlier intervention and treatment   resulting in a better outcome and quality of life use of urine as a diagnostic biofluid as a major organ for excretion the kidney removes waste materials and chemicals from the body  such as increased concentrations of intermediary metabolites of a particular pathway making urine the waste product from the kidney particularly useful for medical diagnostics the key advantages of using urine as a biofluid are 1 its sterility 2 accessibility and noninvasive method of collection and 3 it being largely free from interfering proteins or lipids  although the human urine metabolome is a subset of the human serum metabolome more than 484 compounds identified in urine by bouatra et al either experimentally or via literature review were not previously reported to be in blood  the same group hypothesised that this is because the kidneys do an extraordinary job of removing andor concentrating certain metabolites from the blood hence compounds far below the limit of detection in blood using todays instrumentation are well above the detection limit in urine  this difference combined with the ability of the kidneys to handle abnormally high or abnormally low concentrations of metabolites makes urine a particularly useful biofluid for medical diagnostics  in fact urinary metabolites have been used to characterize nearly 220 diseases  products and services at present metascreen is available only for newborns through cordlife clients selected clinics and hospitals using gcms instrumentation and proprietary planar bioinformatics where multiple analyte profiles are used to detect each metabolic disorder and benchmarked against international and local database of normal samples for the identification of an abnormal case metascreen can accurately and specifically identify the presence or absence of a metabolic disorder up to 250 metabolites that are excreted in the urine are analysed using the gcms for the detection of inborn errors of metabolism the urine specimen of newborns should ideally be collected at 48 hours after birth or within the first 7 days of birth and after the newborn had at least a first feed to enable early detection and treatment of any identified metabolic disorder most babies will test negative for metabolic disorders however if the newborns test shows an abnormal result cordlife will immediately contact the attending physician for example the paediatrician who will then provide instructions on what to do next controversies cordlife announced in october 2013 that cordlife india has introduced metascreen service through a strategic collaboration with navigene genetic science a genetic diagnostic and research company  in 2014 navigene was embroiled in a controversy where its founders were accused of data and scientific research theft and fined for inr 3 million by the adjudicating authority of the department of information technology government of india   navigene rejected all allegations  and has filed a writ petition no wp32912014 with the high court of mumbai to challenge and squash the order

V gorhams disease pronounced goramz also known as gorham vanishing bone disease and phantom bone disease  is a very rare skeletal condition of unknown cause characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of distended thinwalled vascular or lymphatic channels within bone which leads to resorption and replacement of bone with angiomas andor fibrosis   current treatments are experimental only   the symptoms of gorhams disease vary depending on the bones involved it may affect any part of the skeleton but the most common sites of disease are the shoulder skull pelvic girdle jaw ribs and spine     in some cases there are no symptoms until a fracture occurs either spontaneously or following minor trauma such as a fall there may be an acute onset of localized pain and swelling more commonly there is pain of no apparent cause that increases in frequency and intensity over time and may eventually be accompanied by weakness and noticeable deformity of the area the rate of progression is unpredictable and the prognosis can be difficult the disease may stabilize after a number of years go into spontaneous remission or in cases involving the chest and upper spine prove fatal recurrence of the disease following remission can also occur involvement of the spine and skull base may cause a poor outcome from neurological complications in many cases the end result of gorhams disease is severe deformity and functional disability    symptoms such as difficulty breathing and chest pain may be present if the disease is present in the ribs scapula or thoracic vertebrae these may indicate that the disease has spread from the bone into the chest cavity the breathing problems may be misdiagnosed as asthma because the damage done to the lungs can cause the same types of changes to lung function testing that are seen in asthma  extension of the lesions into the chest may lead to the development of chylous pleural and pericardial effusions chyle is rich in protein and white blood cells that are important in fighting infection the loss of chyle into the chest can have serious consequences including infection malnutrition and respiratory distress and failure these complications or their symptoms such as difficulty breathing chest pain poor growth or weight loss and infection have sometimes been the first indications of the condition    to date the specific cause of gorhams disease remains unknown bone mass and strength are obtained and maintained through a process of bone destruction and replacement that occurs at the cellular level throughout a persons life cells called osteoclasts secrete enzymes that dissolve old bone allowing another type of cells called osteoblasts to form new bone except in growing bone the rate of breakdown equals the rate of building thereby maintaining bone mass in gorhams disease that process is disrupted       gorham and stout found that vascular anomalies always occupied space that normally would be filled with new bone and speculated that the presence of angiomatosis may lead to chemical changes in the bone   gorham and others speculated that such a change in the bone chemistry might cause an imbalance in the rate of osteoclast activity to osteoblast activity such that more bone is dissolved than is replaced  beginning in the 1990s there were reports of elevated levels of a protein called interleukin6 il6 being detected in patients with the disease leading some to suggest that increased levels of il6 and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf may contribute to the chemical changes gorham and others believed were the cause of this type of osteolysis   in 1999 möller and colleagues  concluded the gorhamstout syndrome may be essentially a monocentric bone disease with a focally increased bone resorption due to an increased number of paracrine  or autocrine  stimulated hyperactive osteoclasts the resorbed bone is replaced by a markedly vascularized fibrous tissue the apparent contradiction concerning the presence or absence or the number of osteoclasts may be explained by the different phases of the syndrome they further stated that their histopathological study provided good evidence that osteolytic changes seen in gorhams disease are the result of hyperactive osteoclastic bone however others have concluded that lymphangiomatosis and gorhams disease should be considered as a spectrum of disease rather than separate diseases  while there is consensus that gorhams is caused by deranged osteoclastic activity     there is not yet conclusive evidence as to what causes this deranged behavior to begin in 1983 heffez and colleagues  published a case report in which they suggested eight criteria for a definitive diagnosis of gorhams disease in the early stages of the disease xrays reveal changes resembling patchy osteoporosis as the disease progresses bone deformity occurs with further loss of bone mass and in the tubular bones the long bones of the arms and legs a concentric shrinkage is often seen which has been described as having a sucked candy appearance once the cortex the outer shell of the bone has been disrupted vascular channels may invade adjacent soft tissues and joints eventually complete or nearcomplete resorption of the bone occurs and may extend to adjacent bones though spontaneous arrest of bone loss has been reported on occasion throughout this process as the bone is destroyed it is replaced by angiomatous andor fibrous tissue      often gorhams disease is not recognized until a fracture occurs with subsequent improper bone healing the diagnosis essentially is one of exclusion and must be based on combined clinical radiological and histopathological findings  xrays ct scans mris ultrasounds and nuclear medicine bone scans are all important tools in the diagnostic workup and surgical planning but none have the ability alone to produce a definitive diagnosis surgical biopsy with histological identification of the vascular or lymphatic proliferation within a generous section of the affected bone is an essential component in the diagnostic process    recognition of the disease requires a high index of suspicion and an extensive workup because of its serious morbidity gorhams must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions  treatment of gorhams disease is for the most part palliative and limited to symptom management sometimes the bone destruction spontaneously ceases and no treatment is required but when the disease is progressive aggressive intervention may be necessary duffy and colleagues  reported that around 17 of patients with gorhams disease in the ribs shoulder or upper spine experience extension of the disease into the chest leading to chylothorax with its serious consequences and that the mortality rate in this group can reach as high as 64 without surgical intervention a search of the medical literature reveals multiple case reports of interventions with varying rates of success as follows to date there are no known interventions that are consistently effective for gorhams and all reported interventions are considered experimental treatments though many are routine for other conditions some patients may require a combination of these approaches unfortunately some patients will not respond to any intervention gorhams disease is extremely rare and may occur at any age though it is most often recognized in children and young adults it strikes males and females of all races and exhibits no inheritance pattern the medical literature contains case reports from every continent because it is so rare and commonly misdiagnosed it is not known exactly how many people are affected by this disease the literature frequently cites that fewer than 200 cases have been reported though there is consensus building that there are many more cases around the world than have been reported the first known report of the condition came in 1838 in an article titled a boneless arm in what was then the boston medical and surgical journal now the new england journal of medicine  it is a brief report chronicling the case of mr brown who had in 1819 at age 18 years broken his right upper arm in an accident the patient suffered two subsequent accidents which fractured the arm twice more before the curative process had been completed at the time of the report in 1838 the patient was reported as having remarkable use of the arm in spite of the humerus bone having apparently disappeared  xrays did not yet exist thirtyfour years later in 1872 a followup report was published in the same journal following mr browns death from pneumonia at the age of 70 years  the patient had requested the arm be dissected and preserved for the benefit of medical science and this report contains a detailed pathological description of the arm and shoulder abnormalities of the remaining bones of the arm and shoulder are noted and the authors report that the arteries veins and nerves appeared normal there is no mention of lymphatic vessels though several reports of similar cases were published in the interim more than 80 years would pass before another significant report of the condition appeared in the medical literature both born in 1885 lemuel whittington gorham md and arthur purdy stout md had long distinguished careers in medicine and shared a lifelong interest in pathology    dr gorham practiced and taught medicine and oncology and from the mid1950s through the early 1960s conducted and reported the classical clinicopathological investigations of pulmonary embolism during this time period he also authored several case series on osteolysis of bone dr stout began his career as a surgeon and became a pioneer in tumor pathology publishing human cancer in 1932 this work became the model for the atlas of tumor pathology project which stout oversaw as chairman of the national research council in the 1950s in his later years dr stout embarked on a systematic study of soft tissue tumors in children and was among the first to link cigarette smoking to lung cancer in 1954 gorham and three others published a two case series with a brief review of 16 similar cases from the medical literature that advanced the hypothesis that angiomatosis was responsible for this unusual form of massive osteolysis  that same year gorham and stout presented to the american association of physicians their paper in abstract form massive osteolysis acute spontaneous absorption of bone phantom bone disappearing bone its relation to hemangiomatosis  the paper was published in its entirety in october 1955 in the journal of bone and joint surgery concluding that the most typical presentation is that of osteolysis of a single bone or the bones connected by a shared joint such as the shoulder although the disease can attack any bone the shoulder is one of the most commonly involved areas along with the skull and pelvic girdle spontaneous fractures are common and may be the first sign of the disease  a hallmark of the disease is the lack of bone healing following fracture

V sturgeweber syndrome sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis is a rare congenital neurological and skin disorder it is one of the phakomatoses and is often associated with portwine stains of the face glaucoma seizures mental retardation and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma cerebral malformations and tumors sturge weber syndrome can be classified into three different types type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions normally only one side of the brain is affected this type is the most common type 2 involvement includes a facial angioma port wine stain with a possibility of glaucoma developing there is not any evidence of brain involvement symptoms can show at anytime beyond the initial diagnosis of the facial angioma the symptoms can include glaucoma cerebral blood flow abnormalities and headaches more research is needed on this type of sturge weber syndrome type 3 has leptomeningeal angioma involvement exclusively the facial angioma is absent and glaucoma rarely occurs this type is only diagnosed via brain scan  sturgeweber is an embryonal developmental anomaly resulting from errors in mesodermal and ectodermal development unlike other neurocutaneous disorders phakomatoses sturgeweber occurs sporadically ie does not have a hereditary etiology it is caused by a somatic activating mutation occurring in the gnaq gene  radiological findings will show tram track calcifications on ct bilaterally    sturgeweber syndrome is usually manifested at birth by a portwine stain on the forehead and upper eyelid of one side of the face or the whole face the birthmark can vary in color from light pink to deep purple and is caused by an overabundance of capillaries around the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve just under the surface of the face there is also malformation of blood vessels in the pia mater overlying the brain on the same side of the head as the birthmark this causes calcification of tissue and loss of nerve cells in the cerebral cortex neurological symptoms include seizures that begin in infancy and may worsen with age convulsions usually happen on the side of the body opposite the birthmark which vary in severity there may also be muscle weakness on the side of the body opposite the birthmark some children will have developmental delays and cognitive delays about 50 will have glaucoma optic neuropathy often associated with increased intraocular pressure which can be present at birth or develop later increased pressure within the eye can cause the eyeball to enlarge and bulge out of its socket buphthalmos sturgeweber syndrome rarely affects other body organs   ct and mri are most often used to identify intracranial abnormalities when a child is born with a facial cutaneous vascular malformation covering a portion of the upper or the lower eye lids imaging should be performed to screen for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis the haemangioma present on the surface of the brain is in the vast majority of cases on the same side as the birth mark and gradually results in calcification of the underlying brain and atrophy of the affected region   treatment for sturgeweber syndrome is symptomatic laser treatment may be used to lighten or remove the birthmark anticonvulsant medications may be used to control seizures doctors recommend early monitoring for glaucoma and surgery may be performed on more serious cases when one side of the brain is affected and anticonvulsants prove ineffective the standard treatment is neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the affected part of the brain hemispherectomy physical therapy should be considered for infants and children with muscle weakness educational therapy is often prescribed for those with mental retardation or developmental delays but there is no complete treatment for the delays brain surgery involving removing the portion of the brain that is affected by the disorder can be successful in controlling the seizures so that the patient has only a few seizures that are much less intense than presurgery surgeons may also opt to switchoff the affected side of the brain  latanoprost xalatan a prostaglandin may significantly reduce iop intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma associated with sturgeweber syndrome latanoprost is commercially formulated as an aqueous solution in a concentration of 0005 preserved with 002 benzalkonium chloride bac the recommended dosage of latanoprost is one drop daily in the evening which permits better diurnal iop control than does morning instillation its effect is independent of race gender or age and it has few to no side effects contraindications include a history of cme epiretinal membrane formation vitreous loss during cataract surgery history of macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion history of anterior uveitis and diabetes mellitus it is also wise to advise patients that unilateral treatment can result in heterochromia or hypertrichosis that may become cosmetically objectionable   although it is possible for the birthmark and atrophy in the cerebral cortex to be present without symptoms most infants will develop convulsive seizures during their first year of life there is a greater likelihood of intellectual impairment when seizures are resistant to treatment studies do not support the widely held belief that seizure frequency early in life in patients who have sws is a prognostic indicator  it is named for william allen sturge and frederick parkes weber    the sturgeweber foundations the swf international mission is to improve the quality of life and care for people with sturgeweber syndrome and associated port wine birthmark conditions it supports affected individuals and their families with education advocacy and research to promote effective management and awareness the swf was founded by kirk and karen ball who began searching for answers after their daughter was diagnosed with sturgeweber syndrome at birth the swf was incorporated in the usa in 1987 as an international 501c3 nonprofit organization in 1992 the mission was expanded to include individuals with capillary vascular birthmarks klippel trenaunay kt and port wine birthmarks more information regarding the sturgeweber foundation or sturgeweber syndrome is available on their website the hemispherectomy foundation was formed in 2008 to assist families with children who have sturgeweber syndrome and other conditions that require hemispherectomy  the brain recovery project was formed in 2011 to fund research and establish rehabilitation protocols to help children who have had hemispherectomy surgery reach their full potential sturge weber uk swuk formerly sturgeweber foundation uk is a volunteer run registered charity formed in 1990 the charity exists to support those affected by sturge weber syndrome promote research into the condition and raise awareness of the condition amongst both public and professionals the charity was instrumental in setting up a specialist sturge weber clinic at great ormond street hospital httpwwwgoshnhsukmedicalconditionsclinicalspecialtiesneurodisabilityinformationforparentsandvisitorsclinicsandservicessturgeweberclinic it occurs in approximately 1 in 50000 newborns

V osteochondroprogenitor cells are progenitor cells that arise from mesenchymal stem cells msc in the bone marrow they have the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts or chondrocytes depending on the signalling molecules they are exposed to giving rise to either bone or cartilage respectively osteochondroprogenitor cells are important for bone formation and maintenance   alexander friedenstein and his colleagues first identified osteoprogenitor cells in multiple mammalian tissues before any genetic or morphological criteria were put in place for bone marrow or connective tissues osteoprogenitor cells can be identified by their associations with existing bone or cartilage structures or their placement in the embryo as the sites for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis are now known  osteochondroprogenitor can be found between mscs and the terminally differentiated osteoblasts and chondrocytes via different signalling molecules and combinations the osteochondroprogenitor will differentiate into either osteoblasts or chondrocytes main article chondrocytes chondrocytes are only present in cartilage where they will produce cartilaginous matrix to maintain the structure sox9 lsox5 and sox6 are needed for the osteochondroprogenitor to undergo chondrocytic differentiation the transcription factor sox9 can be found in multiple sites in the body pancreas central nervous system intestines and it is also found in all chondrocyte progenitor cells suggesting that they are important in chondrogenesis    main article osteoblast osteoblasts are cells that group together to form units called osteons to produce bone runx2 which may also be known as cbfa1 and osx a zinc finger containing transcription factor are necessary for osteochondroprogenitor cells to differentiate into the osteoblast cell lineage these factors also have a role in hypertrophic chondrocyte maturation    main article betacatenin \u03b2catenin of the canonical wnt signalling pathway plays a role in cell fate determination as it is critical for osteoblastogenesis and the differentiation of chondrocytes into osteoblasts knock out of the entire pathway results in early embryonic death therefore most research of this nature utilised conditional knockouts of the pathway  main article transforming growth factor beta during mandible development most of it is formed through intramembranous ossification where endochondral ossification will occur in the proximal region tgf\u03b2 is important for cell proliferation and differentiation during skeletogenesis during this process tgf\u03b2 can stimulate differentiation into either chondrocytes or osteoblasts via fgf msx1 and ctgf signalling pathways general gene knock out of the tgf\u03b2 resulted in death conditional inactivation of tgf\u03b2r2 of osteochondroprogenitor cells in the cranial neural crest resulted in faster osteoprogenitor differentiation and disorganised chondrogenesis  tgf\u03b2 determines and regulates cell lineages during endochondral ossification through sox9 and runx2 signalling pathways tgf\u03b2 will act as a stimulator of chondrogenesis and an inhibitor of osteoblastic differentiation by blocking the runx2 factor through smad3 activation sox9 stimulates differentiation into chondrocytes sox9 blocked osteochondroprogenitor cells were found to express osteoblast marker genes reprogramming the cells into the osteoblastic lineage    loss of tgf\u03b2 signalling will lead to reduced sox9 activity but not prevent it completely suggesting that there must be other factors and signalling pathways regulating sox9 activity once sox9 activity is lost differentiation into the osteoblastic lineage dominates  it is thought that through a combination of biochemical and biophysical stimuli the uncommitted stem cells of the embryo will undergo differentiation into certain cell lineages however the exact mechanism and signalling pathways are still unclear studies have shown that embryonic stem cells are more mechanosensitive than their differentiated counterparts during embryonic development mesenchymal cells will form cellular structures known as condensations these cellular units will then develop into skeletal and other tissues such as cartilage tendon ligament and muscle tissue osteoprogenitor cell condensations can aggregate dissipate or condense depending on the signals present however these still remain largely unknown depending on the different effects the cellular condensations may differentiate into osteogenic or chondrocytic condensations the positioning of the osteoprogenitor cell condensations determines the cell lineage before the signalling molecules can this is due to their positions relative to any epithelial surfaces osteoblastic and chondrogenic condensations differ in their biophysical parameters within the embryo their distance in relation to the nearest epithelial surface will determine the cell lineage for example osteoblastic condensations are closer to epithelial surfaces so they will be exposed to more biophysical and biochemical stimuli due to the proximity and increased cellepithelial interactions     deletion of the trsp gene in osteochondroprogenitor cells results in abnormal bone growth delayed ossification chondronecrosis and dwarfism general trsp gene deletion is lethal to the embryo the results of this research was used as a model for kashinbeck disease kashinbeck is a result of combinatorial environmentally induced by factors such as toxic mould contaminated grains by mycotoxins and mostly by selenium deficiency which is necessary for selenoprotein function the disease has symptoms similar to those resulting from trsp gene knockout    loss of the regulator pten of the phophatidylinositol3 kinase pathway results in skeletal overgrowth and growth plate dysfunction due to overproduction of the matrix and accelerated hypertrophic differentiation

V youngsimpson syndrome yss is a rare congenital disorder with symptoms including hypothyroidism heart defects facial dysmorphism cryptorchidism in males hypotonia mental retardation and postnatal growth retardation   other symptoms include transient hypothyroidism macular degeneration and torticollis  the condition was discovered in 1987 and the name arose from the individuals who first reported the syndrome   a individual with yss has been identified with having symptoms to a similar syndrome known as ohdo blepharophimosis syndrome showing that it is quite difficult to diagnose the correct condition based on the symptoms present  some doctors therefore consider the syndrome to be the same  the mode of inheritance has had mixed findings based on studies undertaken   one study showed that the parents of an individual with yss are unrelated and phenotypically normal indicating a sporadic mutation thus making it difficult to base the cause of the condition on genetic make up alone  another study however with an individual of yss had first cousins as parents giving the possibility of autosomal recessive inheritance  in 2011 it was demonstrated that de novo mutations in the gene kat6b caused yss

V swyer syndrome or xy gonadal dysgenesis is a type of hypogonadism in a person whose karyotype is 46xy the person is externally female with streak gonads and left untreated will not experience puberty such gonads are typically surgically removed as they have a significant risk of developing tumors and a typical medical treatment would include hormone replacement therapy with female hormones  the syndrome was named by gerald swyer an endocrinologist based in london uk   there are several forms of gonadal dysgenesis the term pure gonadal dysgenesis pgd has been used to describe conditions with normal sets of sex chromosomes eg 46xx or 46xy as opposed to those whose gonadal dysgenesis results from missing all or part of the second sex chromosome the latter group includes those with turner syndrome ie 45x and its variants as well as those with mixed gonadal dysgenesis and a mixture of cell lines some containing a y chromosome eg 46xy45x thus swyer syndrome is referred to as pgd 46xy and xx gonadal dysgenesis as pgd 46xx  patients with pgd have a normal karyotype but may have defects of a specific gene on a chromosome types include the first known step of sexual differentiation of a normal xy fetus is the development of testes the early stages of testicular formation in the second month of gestation requires the action of several genes of which one of the earliest and most important is sry the sexdetermining region of the y chromosome mutations of sry account for many cases of swyer syndrome when such a gene is defective the indifferent gonads fail to differentiate into testes in an xy genetically male fetus without testes no testosterone or antimüllerian hormone amh is produced without testosterone the wolffian ducts fail to develop so no internal male organs are formed also the lack of testosterone means that no dihydrotestosterone is formed and consequently the external genitalia fail to virilize resulting in normal female genitalia without amh the müllerian ducts develop into normal internal female organs uterus fallopian tubes cervix vagina a baby who is externally a girl is born and is normal in all anatomic respects except that the child has nonfunctional streak gonads instead of ovaries or testes as girls ovaries normally produce no important body changes before puberty a defect of the reproductive system typically remains unsuspected until puberty fails to occur in people with swyer syndrome they appear to be normal girls and are generally considered so due to the inability of the streak gonads to produce sex hormones both estrogens and androgens most of the secondary sex characteristics do not develop this is especially true of estrogenic changes such as breast development widening of the pelvis and hips and menstrual periods as the adrenal glands can make limited amounts of androgens and are not affected by this syndrome most of these persons will develop pubic hair though it often remains sparse evaluation of delayed puberty usually reveals elevation of gonadotropins indicating that the pituitary is providing the signal for puberty but the gonads are failing to respond the next steps of the evaluation usually include checking a karyotype and imaging of the pelvis the karyotype reveals xy chromosomes and the imaging demonstrates the presence of a uterus but no ovaries the streak gonads are not usually seen by most imaging although an xy karyotype can also indicate a person with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome the absence of breasts and the presence of a uterus and pubic hair exclude the possibility at this point it is usually possible for a physician to make a diagnosis of swyer syndrome upon diagnosis estrogen and progesterone therapy is typically commenced prompting the development of female characteristics the consequences of streak gonads to a person with swyer syndrome swyer syndrome represents one phenotypic result of a failure of the gonads to develop properly and hence is part of a class of conditions termed gonadal dysgenesis there are many forms of gonadal dysgenesis swyer syndrome is an example of a condition in which an externally unambiguous female body carries dysgenetic atypical or abnormal gonads other examples include complete androgen insensitivity syndrome partial x chromosome deletions lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia and turner syndrome

V amyoplasia is a condition characterized by a generalized lack in the newborn of muscular development and growth with contracture and deformity at most joints it is the most common form of arthrogryposis  it is characterized by quadrimelic involvement  and replacement of skeletal muscle by dense fibrous tissue and fat studies involving amyoplasia have revealed similar findings of the muscle tissue due to various causes including that seen in sacral agenesis and diseases of the anterior horn cell so amyoplasia may also include an intermediate common pathway rather than the primary cause of the contractors   children with amyoplasia often suffer from internally rotated shoulders extended elbows ulnar flexed wrists the type of displacement of the hips and knees is more variable and they often have club feet  most children have symmetrical limb involvement about 10 of children with amyoplasia have evidence of vascular compromise including bowel atresia abdominal wall defects and gastroschisis  it is the most common form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenital amc where multiple joint contractures are present at birth arthrogryposis is derived from the greek word meaning with crooking of joints it occurs in about one out of every 3000 live births there are more than 150 types of amc amyoplasia accounts for 40 of amc cases  there is no single factor that is consistently found in the prenatal history of individuals affected with amyoplasia and in some cases there is no known cause of the disorder amyoplasia is a sporadic condition that occurs due to lack of fetal movement in the womb there is no specific gene that is known to cause the disorder it is thought to be multifactorial meaning that numerous genes and environmental factors play a role in its development the recurrence risk is minimal for siblings or children of affected individuals there have been no reports of recurrent cases of amyoplasia in a family  the fetal akinesia in amyoplasia is thought to be caused by various maternal and fetal abnormalities in some cases the mothers uterus does not allow for adequate fetal movement because of a lack of amniotic fluid known as oligohydramnios or an abnormal shape to the uterus called a bicornuate uterus there may also be a myogenic cause to the fetal akinesia meaning that fetal muscles do not develop properly due to a muscle disease for example a congenital muscular dystrophy similarly connective tissue tendon and skeletal defects may contribute to the fetal akinesia and be the primary cause of amyoplasia additionally malformations may occur in the central nervous system andor spinal cord that can lead to a lack of fetal movement in utero this neurogenic cause is often accompanied by a wide range of other conditions other causes of fetal akinesia may include a maternal fever during pregnancy or a virus amyoplasia results when a fetus is unable to move sufficiently in the womb mothers of children with the disorder often report that their baby was abnormally still during the pregnancy the lack of movement in utero also known as fetal akinesia allows extra connective tissue to form around the joints and therefore the joints become fixed this extra connective tissue replaces muscle tissue leading to weakness and giving a wasting appearance to the muscles additionally due to the lack of fetal movement the tendons that connect the muscles to bone are not able to stretch to their normal length and this contributes to the lack of joint mobility as well  surgery may be necessary to address the congenital deformities frequently occurring in conjunction with arthrogryposis surgery on feet knees hips elbows and wrists may also be useful if more range of motion is needed after therapy has achieved maximum results in some cases tendon transfers can improve function congenital deformities of the feet hips and spine may require surgical correction at or about one year of age  overall prognosis for children with amyoplasia is good intensive therapies throughout developing years include physical therapy occupational therapy and multiple orthopedic procedures most children require therapy for years but almost 23 are eventually able to walk with or without braces and attend school

V brachycephaly from greek roots meaning short and head  is the shape of a skull shorter than typical for its species it is a normal variation in some domesticated dog and cat breeds and can be normal or abnormal in other animal species in humans the cephalic disorder is known as flat head syndrome and results from premature fusion of the coronal sutures see craniosynostosis or from external deformation see plagiocephaly the coronal suture is the fibrous joint that unites the frontal bone with the two parietal bones of the skull the parietal bones form the top and sides of the skull this feature can be seen in down syndrome in anthropology human populations have been characterized as either dolichocephalic long headed mesaticephalic moderate headed or brachycephalic short headed the usefulness of the cephalic index was questioned by giuseppe sergi who argued that cranial morphology provided a better means to model racial ancestry  the incidence of brachycephaly in people has increased dramatically since the advent of sudden infant death syndrome recommendations for parents to keep their babies on their backs  it is considered a cosmetic problem   many pediatricians remain unaware of the issue and possible treatments treatments include regular prone repositioning of babies tummy time there are also cases of brachycephaly associated with plagiocephaly this deformity occurs when there is a combination of brachycephaly and plagiocephaly present brachycephaly with plagiocephaly is positional and has become more prevalent since the back to sleep campaignthe back to sleep campaign began in 1994 as a way to educate parents caregivers and health care providers about ways to reduce the risk for sudden infant death syndrome sids the campaign was named for its recommendation to place healthy babies on their backs to sleep placing babies on their backs to sleep reduces the risk for sids also known as crib death this campaign has been successful in promoting infant back sleeping and other riskreduction strategies to parents family members child care providers health professionals and all other caregivers of infants at a cost of increasing the incidence of this deformation of the head brachycephaly also describes a developmentally normal type of skull with a high cephalic index such as in snubnosed breeds of dog such pugs and bulldogs or cats such as the persian exotic and himalayan   brachycephaly can be corrected with a cranial remolding orthoses helmet which provide painless total contact over the prominent areas of the skull and leave voids over the flattened areas to provide a pathway for more symmetrical skull growth treatment generally takes 34 months but varies depending on the infants age and severity of the cranial asymmetry however studies by scientists in the netherlands have found there was no significant difference over time between infants treated with helmets and infants left untreated all parents of infants treated with helmets confirmed negative side effects including skin irritation and sweating   this study focused only on patients with mild to moderate cases the participation rate was only 21 and there was a 73 reporting of fitting issues  calling into question the validity of the study incorrectly fit devices cannot be expected to yield results additionally independent published research that examined the effectiveness of helmet therapy conclude that as many as 95 of patients demonstrate an improvement in head shape symmetry following helmet therapy and the american orthotics and prosthetics association aopa has serious concerns about the relevance and validity of this study

V the term lordosis refers to the normal inward lordotic curvature of the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine  excessive curvature of the lower back is known as lumbar hyperlordosis commonly called sway back hollow back or saddle back after a similar condition that affects some horses a major feature of lumbar hyperlordosis is a forward pelvic tilt resulting in the pelvis resting on top of the thighs curvature in the opposite convex direction in the thoracic and sacral regions is termed kyphotic when this curvature is excessive it is called kyphosis or hyperkyphosis   normal lordotic curvatures also known as secondary curvatures results in a difference in the thickness between the front and back parts of the intervertebral disc lordosis may also increase at puberty sometimes not becoming evident until the early or mid20s imbalances in muscle strength and length are also a cause such as weak hamstrings or tight hip flexors psoas  other health conditions and disorders can cause lordosis achondroplasia a disorder where bones grow abnormally which can result in short stature as in dwarfism spondylolisthesis a condition in which vertebrae slip forward and osteoporosis the most common bone disease in which bone density is lost resulting in bone weakness and increased likelihood of fracture are some of the most common causes of lordosis other causes include obesity kyphosis spine curvature disorder in which the thoracic curvature is abnormally rounded discitits an inflammation of the intervertebral disc space caused by infection and benign juvenile lordosis  excessive lordotic curvature  lumbar hyperlordosis is also called hollow back saddle back and swayback  although swayback can also refer to a nearly opposite postural misalignment that can initially look quite similar   common causes of lumbar hyperlordosis include tight low back muscles excessive visceral fat and pregnancy rickets a vitamin d deficiency in children can cause lumbar lordosis although lordosis gives an impression of a stronger back incongruently it can lead to moderate to severe lower back pain measurement and diagnosis of lumbar lordosis can be difficult obliteration of vertebral endplate landmarks by interbody fusion may make the traditional measurement of segmental lumbar lordosis more difficult because the l4l5 and l5s1 levels are most commonly involved in fusion procedures or arthrodesis and contribute to normal lumbar lordosis it is helpful to identify a reproducible and accurate means of measuring segmental lordosis at these levels   a visible sign of lordosis is an abnormally large arch of the lower back and the person appears to be puffing out his or her stomach and buttocks precise diagnosis of lordosis is done by looking at a complete medical history physical examination and other tests of the patient xrays are used to measure the lumbar curvature bone scans are conducted in order to rule out possible fractures and infections magnetic resonance imaging mri is used to eliminate the possibility of spinal cord or nerve abnormalities and computed tomography scans ct scans are used to get a more detailed image of the bones muscles and organs of the lumbar region  lumbar lordosis may be treated by strengthening the hip extensors on the back of the thighs and by stretching the hip flexors on the front of the thighs only the muscles on the front and on the back of the thighs can rotate the pelvis forward or backward while in a standing position because they can discharge the force on the ground through the legs and feet abdominal muscles and erector spinae cant discharge force on an anchor point while standing unless one is holding his hands somewhere hence their function will be to flex or extend the torso not the hip  back hyperextensions on a roman chair or inflatable ball will strengthen all the posterior chain and will treat lordosis so too will stiff legged deadlifts and supine hip lifts and any other similar movement strengthening the posterior chain without involving the hip flexors in the front of the thighs abdominal exercises could be avoided altogether if they stimulate too much the psoas and the other hip flexors controversy regarding the degree to which manipulative therapy can help a patient still exists if therapeutic measures reduce symptoms but not the measurable degree of lordotic curvature this could be viewed as a successful outcome of treatment though based solely on subjective data the presence of measurable abnormality does not automatically equate with a level of reported symptoms  while not really a treatment the art of tai chi chuan calls for adjusting the lower back curvature as well as the rest of the spinal curvatures through specific realignments of the pelvis to the thighs its referred to in shorthand as dropping the tailbone the specifics of the structural change are school specific and are part of the jibengung body change methods of these schools the adjustment is referred to in tai chi chuan literature as when the lowest vertebrae are plumb erect   lordosis can be also seen in animals in particular horses and other equines usually called swayback soft back or low back it is an undesirable conformation trait swayback is caused in part from a loss of muscle tone in both the back and abdominal muscles plus a weakening and stretching of the ligaments as in humans it may be influenced by bearing young it is sometimes seen in a broodmare that has had multiple foals however it is also common in older horses whose age leads to loss of muscle tone and stretched ligaments it also occurs due to overuse or injury to the muscles and ligaments from excess work or loads or from premature work placed upon an immature animal equines with too long a back are more prone to the condition than those with a short back but as a longer back is also linked to smoother gaits the trait is sometimes encouraged by selective breeding it has been found to have a hereditary basis in the american saddlebred breed transmitted via a recessive mode of inheritance research into the genetics underlying the condition has several values beyond just the saddlebred breed as it may serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species  lordosis in a sexual context is the naturally occurring position for sexual receptivity in nonprimate mammalian females the lordosis position is facilitated by the appropriate sensory input such as touch or smell for example in female hamsters when they are in the correct hormonal state there are areas on the flank that when touched by the male facilitate lordosis   several brain areas are known to be important for the regulation of lordosis including the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus vmn the activity of the vmn in the regulation of lordosis is estrogendependent and when it is lesioned lordosis is abolished displays of lordosis can be affected by exposure to stress during puberty    specifically stress can suppressed the hypothalamicpituitarygonadal hpg axis and therefore decrease concentrations of gonadal hormones consequently these reductions in exposure to gonadal hormones around puberty can result in decreases in sexual behavior in adulthood including displays of lordosis  lordosis behavior refers to the position that some mammalian females including cats mice and rats display when they are ready to mate in heat the term is also used to describe mounting behavior in male mammals in radiology a lordotic view is an xray taken of a patient leaning backwards  lordosis in the human spine makes it easier for humans to bring the bulk of their mass over the pelvis this allows for a much more efficient walking gait than that of other primates whose inflexible spines cause them to resort to an inefficient forward leaning bentknee bentwaist gait as such lordosis in the human spine is considered one of the primary physiological adaptations of the human skeleton that allows for human gait to be as energetically efficient as it is

V pectus carinatum l car\u012bn\u0101tus equiv to car\u012bna keel also called pigeon chest is a deformity of the chest characterized by a protrusion of the sternum and ribs it is distinct from the related deformity pectus excavatum   people with pectus carinatum usually develop normal hearts and lungs but the deformity may prevent these from functioning optimally in moderate to severe cases of pectus carinatum the chest wall is rigidly held in an outward position thus respirations are inefficient and the individual needs to use the accessory muscles for respiration rather than normal chest muscles during strenuous exercise this negatively affects gas exchange and causes a decrease in stamina children with pectus deformities often tire sooner than their peers due to shortness of breath and fatigue commonly concurrent is mild to moderate asthma some children with pectus carinatum also have scoliosis curvature of the spine some have mitral valve prolapse a condition in which the heart mitral valve functions abnormally connective tissue disorders involving structural abnormalities of the major blood vessels and heart valves are also seen although rarely seen some children have other connective tissue disorders including arthritis visual impairment and healing impairment apart from the possible physiologic consequences pectus deformities can have a significant psychologic impact some people especially those with milder cases live happily with pectus carinatum for others though the shape of the chest can damage their selfimage and confidence possibly disrupting social connections and causing them to feel uncomfortable throughout adolescence and adulthood as the child grows older especially if male bodybuilding techniques may be useful for balancing visual impact pectus carinatum is an overgrowth of cartilage causing the sternum to protrude forward it primarily occurs among four different patient groups and males are more frequently affected than females most commonly pectus carinatum develops in 11to14yearold pubertal males undergoing a growth spurt some parents report that their childs pectus carinatum seemingly popped up overnight second most common is the presence of pectus carinatum at or shortly after birth the condition may be evident in newborns as a rounded anterior chest wall as the child reaches age 2 or 3 years of age the outward sternal protrusion becomes more pronounced pectins carinatum can also be caused by vitamin d deficiency in children rickets due to deposition of unmineralized osteoid least common is a pectus carinatum deformity following openheart surgery or in children with poorly controlled bronchial asthma pectus carinatum is generally a solitary nonsyndromic abnormality however the condition may be present in association with other syndromes turner syndrome noonan syndrome loeysdietz syndrome marfan syndrome ehlersdanlos syndrome morquio syndrome trisomy 18 trisomy 21 homocystinuria osteogenesis imperfecta multiple lentigines syndrome leopard syndrome sly syndrome mucopolysaccharidosis type vii and scoliosis in about 25 of cases of pectus carinatum the patient has a family member with the condition in children teenagers and young adults who have pectus carinatum and are motivated to avoid surgery the use of a customized chestwall brace that applies direct pressure on the protruding area of the chest produces excellent outcomes willingness to wear the brace as required is essential for the success of this treatment approach the brace works in much the same way as orthodontics braces that correct the alignment of teeth the brace consists of front and back compression plates that are anchored to aluminum bars these bars are bound together by a tightening mechanism which varies from brace to brace this device is easily hidden under clothing and must be worn from 14 to 24 hours a day the wearing time varies with each brace manufacturer and the managing physicians protocol which could be based on the severity of the carinatum deformity mild moderate severe and if it is symmetric or asymmetric depending on the manufacturer andor the patients preference the brace may be worn on the skin or it may be worn over a body sock or sleeve called a bracemate specifically designed to be worn under braces a physician or orthotist or brace manufacturers representative can show how to check to see if the brace is in correct position on the chest bracing is becoming more popular over surgery for pectus carinatum mostly because it eliminates the risks that accompany surgery the prescribing of bracing as a treatment for pectus carinatum has trickled down from both paediatric and thoracic surgeons to the family physician and pediatricians again due to its lower risks and welldocumented very high success results regular supervision during the bracing period is required for optimal results adjustments may be needed to the brace as the child grows and the pectus improves if the person with pc is not treated with a brace by the end of puberty the brace technique is not an option as the shape of the ribcage and sternum are set for the rest of their lives for patients with severe pectus carinatum surgery may be necessary however bracing could and may still be the first line of treatment some severe cases treated with bracing may result in just enough improvement that patient is happy with the outcome and may not want surgery afterwards if bracing should fail for whatever reason then surgery would be the next step the two most common procedures are the ravitch technique and the reverse nuss procedure the nuss was developed by donald nuss at the childrens hospital of the kings daughters in norfolk va the nuss is primarily used for pectus excavatum but has recently been revised for use in some cases of pc primarily when the deformity is symmetrical after adolescence some men and women use bodybuilding as a means to hide their deformity some women find that their breasts if large enough serve the same purpose some plastic surgeons perform breast augmentation to disguise mild to moderate cases in women bodybuilding is suggested for people with symmetrical pectus carinatum  pectus deformities usually become more severe during adolescent growth years and may worsen throughout adult life the secondary effects such as scoliosis and cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions may worsen with advancing age body building exercises often attempted to cover the defect with pectoral muscles will not alter the ribs and cartilage of the chest wall and are generally considered not harmful most insurance companies no longer consider chest wall deformities like pectus carinatum to be purely cosmetic conditions while the psychologic impact of any deformity is real and must be addressed the physiological concerns must take precedence the possibility of lifelong cardiopulmonary difficulties is serious enough to warrant a visit to a thoracic surgeon pectus deformities are common about 1 in 400 people have a pectus disorder  pectus carinatum is rarer than pectus excavatum another pectus disorder occurring in only about 20 of people with pectus deformities  about four out of five patients are males

V a supernumerary nipple also known as a third nipple triple nipple accessory nipple  polythelia or the related condition polymastia is an additional nipple occurring in mammals including humans often mistaken for moles supernumerary nipples are diagnosed in humans at a rate of approximately 1 in 3 males  and 1 in 17 females   the nipples appear along the two vertical milk lines which start in the armpit on each side run down through the typical nipples and end at the groin they are classified into eight levels of completeness from a simple patch of hair to a milkbearing breast in miniature   polythelia refers to the presence of an additional nipple alone while polymastia denotes the much rarer presence of additional mammary glands although usually presenting on the milk line pseudomamma can appear as far away as the foot  a possible relationship with mitral valve prolapse has been proposed    the triple nipple club is a documentary shown on channel 4 which explored the biological mystery of the supernumerary nipple  first broadcast on 2 january 2008 it was directed and produced by dan louw and commissioned as part of channel 4s first cut series  the film focuses on louws attempts to understand why he was born with extra nipples a condition he shares with the likes of mark wahlberg  lily allen  and tilda swinton as well as well known tv and film characters such as scaramanga and chandler bing fascinated and confused by this seemingly pointless mutation louw sets off on a personal journey of discovery to try and unwrap the riddle of the triple nipple he starts out by consulting the man in the street and even a renowned teratologist an expert in physical mutations after testing the notion that extra nipples could be a sign of fertility he discovers that they are actually an atavism or evolutionary holdover  a sign of how humans evolved

V diplopodia is a congenital anomaly in tetrapods that involves duplication of elements of the foot on the hind limb it comes from the greek roots diplo  double and pod  foot diplopodia is often found in conjunction with other structural abnormalities  and can be lethal  it is more extreme than polydactyly the presence of extra digits    the affected leg usually has one foot that is in an approximately normal position  the extra foot is composed of at least some metatarsal or tarsal bones and extra digits though it is usually not complete  the feet can be joined together so that the limb appears to have one large foot  or the extra foot can be joined to the limb separately usually above the level of the other foot  diplopodia affects one or both of the hind limbs  recessive alleles of some genes involved in embryonic limb patterning produce bilateral diplopodia   and diplopodia can be experimentally induced in early embryos  many instances of diplopodia in humans have no apparent cause   people have been able to produce diplopod limbs by increasing sonic hedgehog shh signaling in the limb buds of embryos the zone of polarizing activity zpa in the proximal posterior mesoderm of a tetrapod limb bud is responsible for maintaining the anteriorposterior axis of the growing limb  the zpa secretes shh protein which induces formation of the distal segment of the limb or autopod with its posterior side facing the zpa  when zpa cells   nonzpa cells made to express shh  or simply shh proteinsoaked beads  are implanted in the anterior side of a limb bud the end of the resulting limb is duplicated as in diplopodia the posterior autopod on that limb has the normal orientation and the extra anterior autopod has a reversed anteriorposterior axis   this is because the original zpa and the added source of shh signaling each induce the formation of an autopod  diplopodia is often found in combination with aplasia or hypoplasia of the tibia   sometimes the tibia is replaced by another fibula    the extra foot is almost always joined to the normal foot  though a case was described where a nearly complete extra foot joined to the back of the ankle  people have identified five recessive lethal mutations in chickens that cause bilateral diplopodia   the genes are numbered in the order of their discoveries with the symbols dp1 dp2 dp3 dp4 and dp5 chickens normally have an anisodactyl toe arrangement with one short toe pointing backwards and three long toes pointing forwards in diplopodia the feet usually lack the normal hind toe and instead develop two to four extra toes at various positions between the hock joint and the front toes      the toes are almost always connected to extra tarsometatarsal bones    though sometimes the toes do not contain any bone  embryos with diplopodia have been found with numbers of digits on one wing ranging from one to seven    while normal embryos have three digits per wing diplopod limb buds first differ visibly from normal limb buds by their abnormally thick and long apical ectodermal ridges     diplopodia usually delays the embryonic growth of cartilage bone and tendon by two days particularly in the limbs  other characteristics frequently seen in diplopodia mutants are shortened wings and legs   short upper beak    and smaller embryo size   many embryos reach the final embryonic stage but then are unable to hatch    though diplopod embryos can occasionally hatch and mature  single diplopodia mutations produce wide ranges of phenotypes sharing these general characteristics and can even affect individual chickens left and right legs differently  the ranges of phenotypes produced by the different mutations also overlap broadly so diplopodia mutations sometimes need to be distinguished by their phenotype distributions  dr ursula abbott has extensively studied the phenotypes and descriptions of the first four diplopodia mutations and has ranked them from least severe to most severe dp3 dp1 dp4 dp2  diplopodia1 this autosomal mutation gives homozygotes duplicated wing tips and feet in front of the usual structures as in the experimentally induced diplopodia described above   however unlike the experimentally manipulated embryos these embryos show no change in shh expression  the embryos express hoxd11 hoxd12 hoxd13 bmp2 and fgf4 along the whole edge of each limb bud even though these genes are normally only expressed at the posterior edge  diplopodia2 this is an autosomal trait that gives a very extreme diplopod phenotype with up to eight toes on a foot  in some embryos the two outer front toes on each foot are joined together  the trait is now extinct and was never fully characterized  diplopodia3 this is an autosomal trait that may be the least severe of the five diplopodia4 this sexlinked mutation is similar to the previous mutations but causes the embryo to grow thicker wing bones  diplopodia5 this is an autosomal mutation that gives embryos webbing between the inner two front toes on each foot in addition to the usual characteristics of diplopodia  almost all of the embryos survive to the end of incubation but they are unable to clear the fluid from their lungs or absorb the blood from their extraembryonic vessels  these problems always prevent them from hatching  almost all diplopodia5 embryos have only one or two extra toes on each foot so this mutation causes the least extreme foot malformation

V in medicine heterotopia refers to presence of a particular tissue type at a nonphysiological site but usually coexisting with original tissue in its correct anatomical location in other words it implies ectopic tissue in addition to retention of the original tissue type in neuropathology for example gray matter heterotopia is the presence of gray matter within the cerebral white matter or ventricles heterotopia within the brain is often divided into three groups subependymal heterotopia focal cortical heterotopia and band heterotopia another example is a meckels diverticulum which may contain heterotopic gastric or pancreatic tissue in biology specifically heterotopy refers to an altered location of trait expression  in her landmark bookdevelopmental plasticity and evolution maryjane west eberhard has a provocative cover art of the sulphur crested cockatoo and comments on the back cover did its long cresthead feathers evolve by gradual modification of ancestral head feathers or are they descendants of wing feathers developmentally transplanted onto the head this idea sets the tone for the rest of her book which goes into depth about developmental novelties and their relation to evolution heterotopy is a somewhat obscure but well demonstrated example of how developmental change can lead to novel forms the central concept is that a feature seen in one area of an organism has had its location changed in evolutionary lineages   in botany examples of heterotopy include the transfer of bright flower pigments from ancestral petals to leaves that curl and form to mimic petals in other cases experiments have yielded plants with mature leaves present on the highest shoots normal leaf development progresses from the base of the plant to the top as the plant grows upwards it produces new leaves and lower leaves mature  one textbook example of heterotopy in animals a classic in genetics and developmental biology is the experimental induction of legs in place of antennae in fruit flies drosophila the name for this specific induction is antennapedia surprisingly and elegantly the transfer takes place in the experiment with no other strange pleiotropic consequences the leg is transplanted and still is able to rotate on the turretlike complex on the fruit flys head the leg simply replaced the antennae before this experiment it was thought that anatomical structures were somehow constrained into certain not well understood and undefined domains yet the relatively simple modification took place and caused a dramatic change in phenotype this further demonstrated that structures that were thought to be homologous at one time and were later modified still retained some modularity or were interchangeable even millions of years after evolution had sent antennae down a separate path than the other appendages this is due to the common origin of homeotic genes  another wellknown example is the environmentally induced heterotopic change seen in the melanin of the himalayan rabbit and the siamese cat and related breeds  in the himalayan rabbit pigments in fur and skin are only expressed in the most distal portions the very ends of limbs this is similar to the case siamese cats in both the placement of fur pigmentation is induced by temperature the regions furthest from core body heat and with the lowest circulation develop darker as an induced result  individuals raised at a uniform external temperature above 30 c do not express melanin in the extremities and as a result the fur on their paws is left white  the specific gene complex determined to be responsible is in the melanin expression series that is also responsible for albinism this change is not heritable because it is a flexible or plastic phenotypic change the heterotopy demonstrated is that colder body regions are marked by expression of melanin the himalayan rabbit and the siamese cat are examples of artificial selection on heterotopy developed by breeders incidentally long before the concept was understood  the current theory is that people selected for stereotypical phenotypic patterns dark extremities that happened to be repeatedly produced given a typical temperature  this is perhaps the only known example of convergent mechanisms in artificial selection the common human breeding cultures that breed the rabbits and cats tended to themselves favor the pattern in a way closely mimicking the way that the underlying genetics that form flexible adaptations can be selected for based on the phenotype they typically produce in an assumed environment in natural selection heterotopy in molecular biology is the name given to the expression or placement of a gene product from what is typically found in one area to another area it can also be further expanded to a subtle form of exaptation where a gene product used for one underlying purpose in a diverse group of organisms can reemerge repeatedly to produce seemingly paraphyletic distributions of traits but actual phylogenetic analysis supports a monophyletic model as does evolutionary theory heterotopy is used to explain this and there are so commonly cited examples an example is chitin a very durable structural protein used in surgical  sutures as well as durable varnishes but is common to many animals especially crustaceans and insects but is also found in the african clawed frog xenopus laevis  wagner et al suggest that chitin might have a microscopic function observed in cell to cell signaling and the manufacture of insect cuticle for example might represent a recurrent change in the location of expression chitin speculative but however chitin synthase is maintained in many lineages where it does not have an obvious macroscopic function  it is thought that because so many organisms share such a profound degree of genetic and molecular similarity that shifts in the location of expression might be a regular occurrence throughout time molecular analysis shows that proteins that seem to have a single specific function are instead found in many different tissue types one example of this phenomenon is crystallin a clear protein that makes up the lens of the eye it is also has structural functions in the heart

V laryngomalacia literally soft larynx is the most common cause of stridor in infancy in which the soft immature cartilage of the upper larynx collapses inward during inhalation causing airway obstruction it can also be seen in older patients especially those with neuromuscular conditions resulting in weakness of the muscles of the throat however the infantile form is much more common laryngomalacia is one of the most common laryngeal congenital disease in infancy and public education about the signs and symptoms of the disease is lacking   in infantile laryngomalacia the supraglottic larynx the part above the vocal cords is tightly curled with a short band holding the cartilage shield in the front the epiglottis tightly to the mobile cartilage in the back of the larynx the arytenoids these bands are known as the aryepiglottic folds the shortened aryepiglottic folds cause the epiglottis to be curled on itself this is the well known omega shaped epiglottis in laryngomalacia another common finding of laryngomalacia involves the posterior or back part of the larynx where the arytenoid cartilages or the mucosa tissue over the arytenoid cartilages can collapse into the airway and cause airway obstruction laryngomalacia results in partial airway obstruction most commonly causing a characteristic highpitched squeaking noise on inhalation inspiratory stridor some infants have feeding difficulties related to this problem rarely children will have significant life threatening airway obstruction the vast majority however will only have stridor without other more serious symptoms such as dyspnea difficulty breathing although laryngomalacia is not associated with a specific gene it is evidence that some cases may be inherited   relaxation or a lack of muscle tone in the upper airway may be a factor it is often worse when the infant is on his or her back because the floppy tissues can fall over the airway opening more easily in this position  the physician will ask some questions about the babys health problems and may recommend a flexible laryngoscopy to further evaluate the infants condition  laryngomalacia becomes symptomatic after the first few months of life 23 months and the stridor may get louder over the first year as the child moves air more vigorously most of the cases resolve spontaneously and less than 15 of the cases will need surgical intervention parents need to be supported and educated about the condition time is the only treatment necessary in more than 90 of infant cases  in other cases surgery may be necessary    most commonly this involves cutting the aryepiglottic folds to let the supraglottic airway spring open trimming of the arytenoid cartilages or the mucosa tissue over the arytenoid cartilages can also be performed as part of the supraglottoplasty suprglottoplasty can be performed bilaterally on both the left and right sides at the same time or be staged where only one side is operated on at at time  treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease can also help in the treatment of laryngomalacia since gastric contents can cause the back part of the larynx to swell and collapse even further into the airway in some cases a temporary tracheostomy may be necessary

V a capillary hemangioma also known as an infantile hemangioma  strawberry hemangioma   and strawberry nevus  is the most common variant of hemangioma which appears as a raised red lumpy area of flesh anywhere on the body though 83 occur on the head or neck area  these marks occur in about 10 of all births   and usually appear between one and four weeks after birth  it may grow rapidly before stopping and slowly fading some are gone by the age of 2 about 60 by 5 years and 9095 by 9 years  capillary hemangioma is a vascular anomaly capillary hemangiomas occur 5 times more often in female infants than in males and mostly in caucasian populations   additionally low birthweight infants have a 26 chance of developing a hemangioma   it is the most common tumor of orbit and periorbital areas in childhood it may occur in the skin subcutaneous tissues and mucous membranes of oral cavities and lips as well as in the liver spleen and kidneys while this birthmark may be alarming in appearance physicians generally counsel that it be left to disappear on its own unless it is in the way of vision or blocking the nostrils  see also templatecongenital malformations and deformations of skin appendages templatephakomatoses templatepigmentation disorders templatedna replication and repairdeficiency disorder

V a cystic hygroma also known as cystic lymphangioma and macrocystic lymphatic malformation is an often congenital multiloculated lymphatic lesion that can arise anywhere but is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck and armpits this is the most common form of lymphangioma it contains large cystlike cavities containing lymph a watery fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system microscopically cystic hygroma consists of multiple locules filled with lymph in the depth the locules are quite big but they decrease in size towards the surface cystic hygromas are benign but can be disfiguring it is a condition which usually affects children very rarely it can present in adulthood  cystic hygroma is also known as lymphatic malformation currently the medical field prefers to use the term lymphatic malformation because the term cystic hygroma means water tumor  lymphatic malformation is more commonly used now because it is a spongelike collection of abnormal growth that contains clear lymphatic fluid the fluid collects within the cysts or channels usually in the soft tissue cystic hygromas occur when the lymphatic vessels that make up the lymphatic system are not formed properly there are two types of lymphatic malformations they are macrocystic lymphatic malformations large cysts and microcystic small cysts a person may have only one kind of the malformation or can have a mixture of both macro and micro cysts cystic hygroma can be associated with a nuchal lymphangioma or a fetal hydrops  additionally it can be associated with turner syndrome  or with noonan syndrome a lethal version  of this condition is known as cowchock wapner kurtz syndrome that in addition to cystic hygroma includes cleft palate and lymphedema a condition of localized edema and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system    cystic hygromas are increasingly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography a common symptom is a neck growth it may be found at birth or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection  cystic hygromas can grow very large and may affect breathing and swallowing some symptoms may include a mass or lump in the mouth neck cheek or tongue it feels like a large fluidfilled sac in addition cystic hygromas can be found in other body parts such as the arm chest legs groin and buttocks cystic hygromas are also often seen in turners syndrome although a patient who does not have turners syndrome can present with this condition a baby with a prenatally diagnosed cystic hygroma should be delivered in a major medical center equipped to deal with neonatal complications such as a neonatal intensive care unit an obstetrician usually decides the method of delivery if the cystic hygroma is large a cesarean section may be performed after birth infants with a persistent cystic hygroma must be monitored for airway obstruction a thin needle may be used to reduce the volume of the cystic hygroma to prevent facial deformities and airway obstruction close observation of the baby by a neonatologist after birth is recommended if resolution of the cystic hygroma does not occur before birth a pediatric surgeon should be consulted  cystic hygromas that develop in the third trimester after thirty weeks gestation or in the postnatal period are usually not associated with chromosome abnormalities there is a chance of recurrence after surgical removal of the cystic hygroma the chance of recurrence depends on the extent of the cystic hygroma and whether its wall was able to be completely removed  treatments for removal of cystic hygroma are surgery or sclerosing agents which include same patient as on image at top  after 1st surgery same patient  after 4 surgeries

V the ponseti method is a manipulative technique that corrects congenital clubfoot without invasive surgery it was developed by dr ignacio v ponseti of the university of iowa hospitals and clinics usa in the 1950s and was repopularized in 2000 by dr john herzenberg in the usa and europe and in africa by nhs surgeon steve mannion it is a standard  for the treatment of club foot ponseti treatment was introduced in uk in the late 1990s and widely popularized around the country by nhs physiotherapist steve wildon the manipulative treatment of clubfoot deformity is based on the inherent properties of the connective tissue cartilage and bone which respond to the proper mechanical stimuli created by the gradual reduction of the deformity the ligaments joint capsules and tendons are stretched under gentle manipulations a plaster cast is applied after each manipulation to retain the degree of correction and soften the ligaments the displaced bones are thus gradually brought into the correct alignment with their joint surfaces progressively remodeled yet maintaining congruency after two months of manipulation and casting the foot appears slightly overcorrected after a few weeks in splints however the foot looks normal proper foot manipulations require a thorough understanding of the anatomy and kinematics of the normal foot and of the deviations of the tarsal bones in the clubfoot poorly conducted manipulations will further complicate the clubfoot deformity the nonoperative treatment will succeed better if it is started a few days or weeks after birth and if the podiatrist understands the nature of the deformity and possesses manipulative skill and expertise in plastercast applications  clubfoot talipes equinovarus affects almost 150000 children annually almost 80 of these children live in developing nations dr ponsetis technique is painless fast costeffective and successful in almost 100 of all congenital clubfoot cases the ponseti method is endorsed and supported by world health organization    national institutes of health  american academy of orthopedic surgeons  pediatric orthopedic society of north america  european pediatric orthopedic society  cure  steps charity uk  steps charity south africa  a leg to stand on india  and others at the 2007 international clubfoot symposium attended by 200 doctors from 44 countries papers were presented for an estimated 10000 children successfully treated with the technique around the world in the past few years the ponseti international association for the advancement of clubfoot treatment was founded in 2006 at the university of iowa the ponseti international association aims to improve the treatment of children born with clubfoot through education research and improved access to care steps are as follows 1 the calcaneal internal rotation adduction and plantar flexion is the key deformity the foot is adducted and planterflexed at the subtalar joint and the goal is to abduct the foot and dorsiflex it in order to achieve correction of the clubfoot the calcaneum should be allowed to rotate freely under the talus bone which also is free to rotate in the ankle mortise the correction takes place through the normal arc of the subtalar joint this is achieved by placing the index finger of the operator on the medial malleolus to stabilize the leg and levering on the thumb placed on the lateral aspect head of the talus while abducting the forefoot in supination forcible attempts at correcting the heel varus by abducting the forefoot while applying counter pressure at the calcaneocuboid joint prevents the calcaneum from abducting and therefore everting 2 foot cavus increases when the forefoot is pronated if cavus is present the first step in the manipulation process is to supinate the forefoot by gently lifting the dropped first metatarsal to correct the cavus once the cavus is corrected the forefoot can be abducted as outlined in step 1 3 pronation of the foot also causes the calcaneum to jam under the talus the calcaneum cannot rotate and stays in varus the cavus increases as outlined in step 2 this results in a beanshaped foot at the end of step 1 the foot is maximally abducted but never pronated 4 the manipulation is carried out in the cast room with the baby having been fed just prior to the treatment or even during the treatment after the foot is manipulated a long leg cast is applied to hold the correction initially the short leg component is applied the cast should be snug with minimal but adequate padding the authors paint or spray the limb with tincture of benzoin to allow adherence of the padding to the limb the authors prefer to apply additional padding strips along the medial and lateral borders to facilitate safe removal of the cast with a cast saw the cast must incorporate the toes right up to the tips but not squeeze the toes or obliterate the transverse arch the cast is molded to contour around the heel while abducting the forefoot against counter pressure on the lateral aspect of the head of the talus the knee is flexed to 90 for the long leg component of the cast the parents can soak these casts for 3045 minutes prior to removal with a plaster knife the authors preferred method is to use the oscillating plaster saw for cast removal the cast is bivalved and removed the cast then is reconstituted by coapting the two halves this allows for monitoring of the progress of the forefoot abduction and in the later stages the amount of dorsiflexion or equinus correction 5 forcible correction of the equinus and cavus by dorsiflexion against a tight achilles tendon results in a spurious correction through a break in the midfoot resulting in a rockerbottom foot the cavus should be separately treated as outlined in step 2 and the equinus should be corrected without causing a midfoot break it generally takes up to 47 casts to achieve maximum foot abduction the casts are changed weekly the foot abduction correction can be considered adequate when the thighfoot axis is 60 after maximal foot abduction is obtained most cases require a percutaneous achilles tenotomy this is performed in the cast room under aseptic conditions the local area is anesthetized with a combination of a topical lignocaine preparation eg emla cream and minimal local infiltration of lidocaine the tenotomy is performed through a stab incision with a round tip 6400 beaver blade the wound is closed with a single absorbable suture or with adhesive stripsthe final cast is applied with the foot in maximum dorsiflexion and the foot is held in the cast for 23 weeks 6 following the manipulation and casting phase the feet are fitted with opentoed straightlaced shoes attached to a denis browne bar the affected foot is abducted externally rotated to 70 with the unaffected foot set at 45 of abduction the shoes also have a heel counter bumper to prevent the heel from slipping out of the shoe the shoes are worn for 23 hours a day for three months and are worn at night and during naps for up to three years 7 in 1030 of cases a tibialis anterior tendon transfer to the lateral cuneiform is performed when the child is approximately three years of age this gives lasting correction of the forefoot preventing metatarsus adductus and foot inversion this procedure is indicated in a child aged 225 years with dynamic supination of the foot prior to surgery cast the foot in a long leg cast for a few weeks to regain the correction

V larsen syndrome ls is a congenital disorder discovered in 1950 by larsen and associates when they observed dislocation of the large joints and face anomalies in six of their patients  patients suffering from larsen syndrome normally present with a variety of symptoms including congenital anterior dislocation of the knees dislocation of the hips and elbows flattened facial appearance prominent foreheads and depressed nasal bridges  larsen syndrome can also cause a variety of cardiovascular  and orthopedic abnormalities  this rare disorder is caused by a genetic defect in the gene encoding filamin b a cytoplasmic protein that is important in regulating the structure and activity of the cytoskeleton  the gene that influences the emergence of larsen syndrome is found in chromosome region 3p211141 a region containing human type vii collagen gene  larsen syndrome has recently been described as a mesenchyme disorder that affects the connective tissue of an individual  autosomal dominant and recessive forms of the disorder have been reported although most cases are autosomal dominant  reports have found that in western societies larsen syndrome can be found in one in every 100000 births but this is most likely an underestimate because the disorder is frequently unrecognized or misdiagnosed    symptoms are related to defects in connective tissue cardiac defects are similar to those associated with marfans syndrome a disorder of the connective tissue these symptoms were found in rare cases of larsen syndrome filamins are cytoplasmic proteins that regulate the structure and activity of the cytoskeleton these proteins serve as scaffolds on which intracellular signaling and protein trafficking are organized filamin b has been found to be expressed in human growth plate chondrocytes which are especially important in vertebrae segmentation and skeleton morphogenesis genetic analysis of patients with larsen syndrome has found the syndrome is caused by missense mutations in the gene that codes for filamin b these mutations cause an accelerated rate of apoptosis in the epiphyseal growth plates of individuals with the mutation the defects can cause short stature and other symptoms associated with larsen syndrome  genetic analysis has found that a gene linked to larsen syndrome lar1 is strongly linked to chromosome 3p markers the locus of this gene is found in a region defined distally by d3s1581 and proximally by d3s1600 this location can be mapped to chromosome region 3p211141 human type vii collagen gene is found within this region in chromosome region 3p211 it is reasonable to believe that the joint abnormalities and cardiac anomalies associated with larsen syndrome are related to the fact that the human type vii collagen gene is found within the same chromosome region as the lar1 gene  both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of larsen syndrome have been reported the former is significantly more common than the latter symptoms such as syndactyly cleft palate short stature and cardiac defects are seen more commonly in individuals with the autosomal recessive form of the disorder a lethal form of the disorder has been reported it is described as being a combination of the larsen phenotype and pulmonary hypoplasia  ultrasound remains as one of the only effective ways of prenatally diagnosing larsen syndrome prenatal diagnosis is extremely important as it can help families prepare for the arrival of an infant with several defects ultrasound can capture prenatal images of multiple joint dislocations abnormal positioning of legs and knees depressed nasal bridge prominent forehead and club feet these symptoms are all associated with larsen syndrome so they can be used to confirm that a fetus has the disorder  while larsen syndrome can be lethal if untreated the prognosis is relatively good if individuals are treated with orthopedic surgery physical therapy and other procedures used to treat the symptoms linked with larsen syndrome  treatment for larsen syndrome varies according to the symptoms of the individual  orthopedic surgery can be performed to correct the serious joint defects associated with larsen syndrome reconstructive surgery can be used to treat the facial abnormalities cervical kyphosis can be very dangerous to an individual because it can cause the vertebrae to disturb the spinal cord posterior cervical arthrodesis has been performed on patients with cervical kyphosis and the results have been successful  propranolol has been used to treat some of the cardiac defects associated with marfans syndrome so the drug also has been suggested to treat cardiac defects associated with larsen syndrome  ankyrin long qt syndrome 4

V an accessory auricle is considered a developmental anomaly resulting from the persistence of a structure which variably recapitulates the normal external ear   there may be several components or degrees of development ranging from an ear tag preauricular appendage preauricular tag accessory tragus to supernumerary ears or polyotia   it is a relatively common congenital anomaly of the first branchial arch or second branchial arches other anomalies may be present concurrently including cleft palate cleft lip or mandibular hypoplasia there is a known association with goldenhar syndrome oculoauriculovertebral syndrome  and with wildervanck syndrome    there may also be an association with congenital cartilaginous rest of the neck the general presentation is of a skincovered nodule papule or nodule of the skin surface usually immediately anterior to the auricle however it may be anywhere within the periauricular tissues bilateral presentation can be seen      the lesions presents as a nodule or papule either sessile or pedunculated they may be soft or have a cartilaginous structure by histologic examination it is a recapitulation of normal external auricle there will be skin cartilaginous structures and cartilage although the later is not seen in all variants of this disorder   some investigators believe that the tragus is the only hillock which is derived from the first branchial arch this is clearly suggestive that true cases of accessory auricle represent a true duplication of the hillocks that were part of the second branchial arch  the second ear appears as a mirror image folded forward and lying on the posterior cheek these structures are distinctly different from squamous papilloma and benign teratoma simple surgical excision is curative  the recommended treatment is that the skin is peeled off the extraauricular tissue and protruding cartilage remnants are trimmed  normal appearance is achieved in majority of cases the reconstruction successful in true cases of accessory auricle as it also is in individuals with auricular appendages   these lesions usually present in neonates although they may not come to clinical attention until adulthood for cosmetic reasons there is no gender predilection they are present in approximately 36 per 1000 live births  lester d r thompson bruce m wenig 2011 diagnostic pathology head and neck published by amirsys hagerstown md lippincott williams  wilkins pp723 isbn1931884617

V 3604 12952 a teratoma is a tumor with tissue or organ components resembling normal derivatives of more than one germ layer although the teratoma may be monodermal or polydermal originating from one or more germ layers its cells may differentiate in ways suggesting other germ layers the tissues of a teratoma although normal in themselves may be quite different from surrounding tissues and may be highly disparate teratomas have been reported to contain hair teeth bone and very rarely more complex organs or processes such as eyes   torso   and hands feet or other limbs  usually a teratoma will contain no organs but rather one or more tissues normally found in organs such as the brain thyroid liver and lung sometimes the teratoma has within its capsule one or more fluidfilled cysts when a large cyst occurs there is a potential for the teratoma to produce a structure within the cyst that resembles a fetus because they are encapsulated teratomas are usually benign although several forms of malignant teratoma are known and some of these are common forms of teratoma a mature teratoma is typically benign and found more commonly in women while an immature teratoma is typically malignant and is more often found in men teratomas are thought to be present at birth congenital but small ones often remain undiscovered until much later in life definitive medical diagnosis of a teratoma is based on its histology as is true throughout oncology the study of tumors malignant and benign the nomenclature for these tumors continually evolves on the basis of threads of consensus in the scientific literature regarding the tumors classification which is based on shared embryologic origins clinicopathologic characteristics and so on as science advances more is understood about how one can differentiate tumors that formerly seemed alike for example the scientific knowledge of tumor markers genomics and proteomics regularly advances in this environment tumor names may slip over the years between synonymity hyponymy and hypernymy and deprecation some terms that have been synonymous with teratoma include dysembryoma teratoblastoma organoid tumor and teratoid tumor  the words teratoma and mature teratoma both have been used to refer to a benign growth while the word teratoma may also refer to immature teratoma a cancerous growth avoiding misunderstanding due to such polysemy is part of why tumor nomenclature changes over decades the nomenclatural changes are voluntary based on scientists agreeing or debating in the literature regarding what to call particular neoplastic entities types of tumors the term malignant teratoma has sometimes been used as a synonym for nonseminomatous germ cell tumor  teratomas of germ cell origin usually are found ie present in adult men and women but they may also be found in children and infants teratomas of embryonal origin are most often found in babies at birth in young children and since the advent of ultrasound imaging in fetuses the most commonly diagnosed fetal teratomas are sacrococcygeal teratoma altman types i ii and iii and cervical neck teratoma because these teratomas project from the fetal body into the surrounding amniotic fluid they can be seen during routine prenatal ultrasound exams teratomas within the fetal body are less easily seen with ultrasound for these mri of the pregnant uterus is more informative   teratomas are not dangerous for the fetus unless there is either a mass effect or a large amount of blood flow through the tumor known as vascular steal the mass effect frequently consists of obstruction of normal passage of fluids from surrounding organs the vascular steal can place a strain on the growing heart of the fetus even resulting in heart failure and thus must be monitored by fetal echocardiography after surgery there is a risk of regrowth in place or in nearby organs  teratomas belong to a class of tumors known as nonseminomatous germ cell tumor nsgct all tumors of this class are the result of abnormal development of pluripotent cells germ cells and embryonal cells teratomas of embryonic origin are congenital teratomas of germ cell origin may or may not be congenital this is not known the kind of pluripotent cell appears to be unimportant apart from constraining the location of the teratoma in the body teratomas derived from germ cells occur in the testes in men and ovaries in women teratomas derived from embryonic cells usually occur on the subjects midline in the brain elsewhere in the skull in the nose in the tongue under the tongue and in the neck cervical teratoma mediastinum retroperitoneum and attached to the coccyx teratomas may also occur elsewhere very rarely in solid organs most notably the heart and liver and hollow organs such as the stomach and bladder and more commonly on the skull sutures concerning the origin of teratomas there exist numerous hypotheses  these hypotheses are not to be confused with the unrelated hypothesis that fetus in fetu see below is not a teratoma at all but rather a parasitic twin a mature teratoma is a grade 0 teratoma mature teratomas are highly variable in form and histology and may be solid cystic or a combination of solid and cystic a mature teratoma often contains several different types of tissue such as skin muscle and bone skin may surround a cyst and grow abundant hair see dermoid cyst mature teratomas generally are benign malignant mature teratomas are of several distinct types a dermoid cyst is a mature cystic teratoma containing hair sometimes very abundant and other structures characteristic of normal skin and other tissues derived from the ectoderm the term is most often applied to teratoma on the skull sutures and in the ovaries of females fetus in fetu and fetiform teratoma are rare forms of mature teratoma that include one or more components resembling a malformed fetus both forms may contain or appear to contain complete organ systems even major body parts such as torso or limbs fetus in fetu differs from fetiform teratoma in having an apparent spine and bilateral symmetry  most authorities agree that fetiform teratomas are highly developed mature teratomas the natural history of fetus in fetu is controversial  there also may be a cultural difference with fetiform teratoma being reported more often in ovarian teratomas by gynecologists and fetus in fetu being reported more often in retroperitoneal teratomas by general surgeons fetus in fetu has often been interpreted as a fetus growing within its twin as such this interpretation assumes a special complication of twinning one of several grouped under the term parasitic twin in this regard it is noteworthy that in many cases the fetus in fetu is reported to occupy a fluidfilled cyst within a mature teratoma     cysts within mature teratoma may have partially developed organ systems reports include cases of partial cranial bones long bones and a rudimentary beating heart   regardless of whether fetus in fetu and fetiform teratoma are one entity or two they are distinct from and not to be confused with ectopic pregnancy a struma ovarii literally goitre of the ovary is a rare form of mature teratoma that contains mostly thyroid tissue teratomas are thought to be present since birth or even before birth and therefore can be considered congenital tumors many teratomas are not diagnosed until much later in childhood or in adulthood large tumors are more likely to be diagnosed early on sacrococcygeal and cervical teratomas are often detected by prenatal ultrasound additional diagnostic methods may include prenatal mri in rare circumstances the tumor is so large that the fetus may be damaged or die in the case of large sacrococcygeal teratomas a significant portion of the fetus blood flow is redirected toward the teratoma a phenomenon called steal syndrome causing heart failure or hydrops of the fetus in certain cases fetal surgery may be indicated beyond the newborn period symptoms of a teratoma depend on its location and organ of origin ovarian teratomas often present with abdominal or pelvic pain caused by torsion of the ovary or irritation of its ligaments a recently discovered condition where ovarian teratomas cause encephalitis associated with antibodies against the nmethyldaspartate receptor nmdar  often simply referred to as antinmda receptor encephalitis was identified as a serious complication patients develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis memory deficits seizures and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements and autonomic and breathing instability  testicular teratomas present as a palpable mass in the testis mediastinal teratomas often cause compression of the lungs or the airways and may present with chest pain andor respiratory symptoms some teratomas contain yolk sac elements which secrete alphafetoprotein afp detection of afp may help to confirm the diagnosis and is often used as a marker for recurrence or treatment efficacy but is rarely the method of initial diagnosis maternal serum alphafetoprotein or msafp is a useful screening test for other fetal conditions including down syndrome spina bifida and abdominal wall defects such as gastroschisis regardless of location in the body a teratoma is classified according to a cancer staging system this indicates whether chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be needed in addition to surgery teratomas commonly are classified using the gonzalezcrussi  grading system 0 or mature benign 1 or immature probably benign 2 or immature possibly malignant cancerous and 3 or frankly malignant if frankly malignant the tumor is a cancer for which additional cancer staging applies teratomas are also classified by their content a solid teratoma contains only tissues perhaps including more complex structures a cystic teratoma contains only pockets of fluid or semifluid such as cerebrospinal fluid sebum or fat a mixed teratoma contains both solid and cystic parts cystic teratomas usually are grade 0 and conversely grade 0 teratomas usually are cystic grade 0 1 and 2 pure teratomas have the potential to become malignant grade 3 and malignant pure teratomas have the potential to metastasize these rare forms of teratoma with malignant transformation may contain elements of somatic non germ cell malignancy such as leukemia carcinoma or sarcoma  a teratoma may contain elements of other germ cell tumors in which case it is not a pure teratoma but rather is a mixed germ cell tumor and is malignant in infants and young children these elements usually are endodermal sinus tumor followed by choriocarcinoma finally a teratoma can be pure and not malignant yet highly aggressive this is exemplified by growing teratoma syndrome in which chemotherapy eliminates the malignant elements of a mixed tumor leaving pure teratoma which paradoxically begins to grow very rapidly a benign grade 0 mature teratoma nonetheless has a risk of malignancy recurrence with malignant endodermal sinus tumor has been reported in cases of formerly benign mature teratoma   even in fetiform teratoma and fetus in fetu   squamous cell carcinoma has been found in a mature cystic teratoma at the time of initial surgery  a grade 1 immature teratoma that appears to be benign eg because afp is not elevated has a much higher risk of malignancy and requires adequate followup     this grade of teratoma also may be difficult to diagnose correctly it can be confused with other small round cell neoplasms such as neuroblastoma small cell carcinoma of hypercalcemic type primitive neuroectodermal tumor wilms tumor desmoplastic small round cell tumor and nonhodgkin lymphoma  a teratoma with malignant transformation tmt is a very rare form of teratoma that may contain elements of somatic non germ cell malignant tumors such as leukemia carcinoma or sarcoma  of 641 children with pure teratoma nine developed tmt  five carcinoma two glioma and two embryonal carcinoma here these last are classified among germ cell tumors extraspinal ependymoma usually considered to be a glioma a type of nongerm cell tumor may be an unusual form of mature teratoma  the treatment of choice is complete surgical removal ie complete resection   teratomas are normally wellencapsulated and noninvasive of surrounding tissues hence they are relatively easy to resect from surrounding tissues exceptions include teratomas in the brain and very large complex teratomas that have pushed into and become interlaced with adjacent muscles and other structures prevention of recurrence does not require en bloc resection of surrounding tissues for malignant teratomas usually surgery is followed by chemotherapy teratomas that are in surgically inaccessible locations or are very complex or are likely to be malignant due to late discovery andor treatment sometimes are treated first with chemotherapy although often described as benign a teratoma does have malignant potential in a uk study of 351 infants and children diagnosed with benign teratoma reported 227 with mt 124 with it five years after surgery eventfree survival was 922 and 859 respectively and overall survival was 99 and 951  a similar study in italy reported on 183 infants and children diagnosed with teratoma at 10 years after surgery event free and overall survival were 904 and 98 respectively  depending on which tissues it contains a teratoma may secrete a variety of chemicals with systemic effects some teratomas secrete the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin \u03b2hcg which can be used in clinical practice to monitor the successful treatment or relapse in patients with a known hcgsecreting teratoma this hormone is not recommended as a diagnostic marker because most teratomas do not secrete it some teratomas secrete thyroxine in some cases to such a degree that it can lead to clinical hyperthyroidism in the patient of special concern is the secretion of alphafetoprotein afp under some circumstances afp can be used as a diagnostic marker specific for the presence of yolk sac cells within the teratoma these cells can develop into a frankly malignant tumor known as yolk sac tumor or endodermal sinus tumor adequate followup requires close observation involving repeated physical examination scanning ultrasound mri or ct and measurement of afp andor \u03b2hcg   embryonal teratomas most commonly occur in the sacrococcygeal region sacrococcygeal teratoma is the single most common tumor found in newly born humans of teratomas on the skull sutures approximately 50 are found in or adjacent to the orbit  limbal dermoid is a choristoma not a teratoma teratoma qualifies as a rare disease but is not extremely rare sacrococcygeal teratoma alone is diagnosed at birth in one out of 40000 humans given the current human population and birthrate this equals five per day or 1800 per year add to that number sacrococcygeal teratomas diagnosed later in life and teratomas in other locales and the incidence approaches ten thousand new diagnoses of teratoma per year in light of the ethical issues surrounding the source of human stem cells teratomas are being looked at as an alternative source for research because they lack the potential to grow into functional human beings ovarian teratomas have been reported in mares   and in canines  teratomas also occur rarely in other species  this article

V newborn screening is a public health program designed to screen infants shortly after birth for a list of conditions that are treatable but not clinically evident in the newborn period some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of the disease screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction the number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction and can vary greatly most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper however many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive followup testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infants pediatrician or primary care physician newborn screening debuted as a public health program in the united states in the early 1960s and has expanded to countries around the world with different testing menus in each country the first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was phenylketonuria a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential amino acid phenylalanine can cause irreversible mental retardation unless detected early with early detection and dietary management the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated robert guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper   robert guthrie is given much of the credit for pioneering the earliest screening for phenylketonuria in the late 1960s using blood samples obtained by pricking a newborn babys heel on the second day of life on filter paper  congenital hypothyroidism was the second disease widely added in the 1970s  guthrie and colleagues also developed bacterial inhibition assays for the detection of maple syrup urine disease and classic galactosemia  the development of tandem mass spectrometry screening in the early 1990s led to a large expansion of potentially detectable congenital metabolic diseases that can be identified by characteristic patterns of amino acids and acylcarnitines  in the united states the american college of medical genetics recommended a uniform panel of diseases that all infants born in every state should be screened for they also developed an evidencebased review process for the addition of conditions in the future the implementation of this panel across the united states meant all babies born would be screened for the same number of conditions prior to this babies born in different states had received different levels of screening on april 24 2008 president george w bush signed into law the newborn screening saves lives act of 2007 this act was enacted to increase awareness among parents health professionals and the public on testing newborns to identify certain disorders it also sought to improve expand and enhance current newborn screening programs at the state level newborn screening programs initially used screening criteria based largely on criteria established by jmg wilson and f jungner in 1968  although not specifically about newborn population screening programs their publication principles and practice of screening for disease proposed ten criteria that screening programs should meet before being used as a public health measure newborn screening programs are administered in each jurisdiction with additions and removals from the panel typically reviewed by a panel of experts the four criteria from the publication that were relied upon when making decisions for early newborn screening programs were as diagnostic techniques have progressed debates have arisen as to how screening programs should adapt tandem mass spectrometry has greatly expanded the potential number of diseases that can be detected even without satisfying all of the other criteria used for making screening decisions   duchenne muscular dystrophy is a disease that has been added to screening programs in several jurisdictions around the world despite the lack of evidence as to whether early detection improves the clinical outcome for a patient  newborn screening tests are most commonly done from whole blood samples collected on specially designed filter paper the filter paper is often attached to a form containing required information about the infant and parents this includes date and time of birth date and time of sample collection the infants weight and gestational age the form will also have information about whether the baby has had a blood transfusion and any additional nutrition the baby may have received total parenteral nutrition most newborn screening cards also include contact information for the infants physician in cases where follow up screening or treatment is needed the canadian province of quebec performs newborn screening on whole blood samples collected as in most other jurisdictions and also runs a voluntary urine screening program where parents collect a sample at 21 days of age and submit it to a provincial laboratory for an additional panel of conditions   newborn screening samples are collected from the infant between 24 hours and 7 days after birth with the requirement that the baby has fed at least once samples can be collected at the hospital or by midwives if a sample is collected from an infant who is less than 24 hours old the laboratory will often request a repeat specimen be taken after 24 hours samples are mailed daily to the laboratory responsible for testing in the united states and canada newborn screening is mandatory with an option for parents to opt out of the screening in writing if they desire   in most of europe newborn screening is done with the consent of the parents proponents of mandatory screening claim that the test is for the benefit of the child and that parents should not be able to opt out on their behalf in regions that favour informed consent for the procedure they report no increase in costs no decrease in the number of children screened and no cases of included diseases in children who did not undergo screening  because newborn screening programs test for a number of different conditions a number of different laboratorial methodologies are used as well as bedside testing for hearing loss using evoked auditory potentials  and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry  newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder starting with phenylketonuria in the early 1960s  with this testing methodology newborn screening required one test to detect one condition as mass spectrometry became more widely available the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and amino acids from a single dried blood spot this increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening enzyme assays are used to screen for galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency immunoassays measure thyroid hormones for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism and 17hydroxyprogesterone for the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency the goal is to report the results within a short period of time if screens are normal a paper report is sent to the submitting hospital and parents rarely hear about it if an abnormality is detected employees of the agency usually nurses begin to try to reach the physician hospital andor nursery by telephone they are persistent until they can arrange an evaluation of the infant by an appropriate specialist physician depending on the disease the specialist will attempt to confirm the diagnosis by repeating the tests by a different method or laboratory or by performing other corroboratory or disproving tests the confirmatory test varies depending on the positive results on the initial screen confirmatory testing can include analyte specific assays to confirm any elevations detected functional studies to determine enzyme activity and genetic testing to identify diseasecausing mutations in some cases a positive newborn screen can also trigger testing on other family members such as siblings who did not undergo newborn screening for the same condition or the babys mother as some maternal conditions can be identified through results on the babys newborn screen depending on the likelihood of the diagnosis and the risk of delay the specialist will initiate treatment and provide information to the family performance of the program is reviewed regularly and strenuous efforts are made to maintain a system that catches every infant with these diagnoses guidelines for newborn screening and follow up have been published by the american academy of pediatrics  and the american college of medical genetics  newborn screening is intended as a public health program to identify infants with treatable conditions before they present clinically or suffer irreversible damage phenylketonuria pku was the first disorder targeted for newborn screening being implemented in a small number of hospitals and quickly expanding across the united states and the rest of the world  after the success of newborn screening for pku 39 infants were identified and treated in the first two years of screening with no false negative results guthrie and others looked for other disorders that could be identified and treated in infants eventually developing bacterial inhibition assays to identify classic galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease   newborn screening has expanded since the introduction of pku testing in the 1960s but can vary greatly between countries in 2011 the united states screened for 54 conditions germany for 12 the united kingdom for 2 pku and medium chain acylcoa dehydrogenase deficiency mcadd while france and hong kong only screened for one condition pku and congenital hypothyroidism respectively  the conditions included in newborn screening programs around the world vary greatly based on the legal requirements for screening programs prevalence of certain diseases within a population political pressure and the availability of resources for both testing and followup of identified patients newborn screening originated with an amino acid disorder phenylketonuria pku which can be easily treated by dietary modifications but causes severe mental retardation if not identified and treated early robert guthrie introduced the newborn screening test for pku in the early 1960s  with the knowledge that pku could be detected before symptoms were evident and treatment initiated screening was quickly adopted around the world austria started screening for pku in 1966  and england in 1968  with the advent of tandem mass spectrometry as a screening tool several fatty acid oxidation disorders were targeted for inclusion in newborn screening programs medium chain acylcoa dehydrogenase deficiency mcadd which had been implicated in several cases of sudden infant death syndrome    was one of the first conditions targeted for inclusion mcadd was the first condition added when the united kingdom expanded their screening program from pku only  population based studies in germany the united states and australia put the combined incidence of fatty acid oxidation disorders at 19300 among caucasians the united states screens for all known fatty acid oxidation disorders either as primary or secondary targets while other countries screen for a subset of these  the introduction of screening for fatty acid oxidation disorders has been shown to have reduced morbidity and mortality associated with the conditions particularly mcadd an australian study found a 74 reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having mcadd versus those who presented clinically prior to screening studies in the netherlands and united kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically  newborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions prior to its inclusion in newborn screening shortchain acylcoa dehydrogenase deficiency scadd was thought to be lifethreatening most patients identified via newborn screening as having this enzyme deficiency were asymptomatic to the extent that scadd was removed from screening panels in a number of regions without the cohort of patients identified by newborn screening this clinical phenotype would likely not have been identified  the most commonly included disorders of the endocrine system are congenital hypothyroidism ch and congenital adrenal hyperplasia cah  testing for both disorders can be done using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card screening for ch is done by measuring thyroxin t4 thyrotropin tsh or a combination of both analytes elevated 17hydroxyprogesterone 17ohp is the primary marker used when screening for cah most commonly done using enzymelinked immunosorbant assays with many programs using a second tier tandem mass spectrometry test to reduce the number of false positive results  careful analysis of screening results for cah may also identify cases of congenital adrenal hypoplasia which presents with extremely low levels of 17ohp  ch was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s often as the second condition included after pku the most common cause of ch is dysgenesis of the thyroid gland after many years of newborn screening the incidence of ch worldwide had been estimated at 13600 births with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups recent data from certain regions have showed an increase with new york reporting an incidence of 11700 reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied but no explanation has been found  classic cah the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid 21hydroxylase and comes in two forms  simple virilizing and a saltwasting form incidence of cah can vary greatly between populations the highest reported incidence rates are among the yupic eskimos of alaska 1280 and on the french island of réunion 12100  any condition that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin is included under the broad category of hemoglobinopathies worldwide it is estimated that 7 of the population may carry a hemoglobinopathy with clinical significance  the most well known condition in this group is sickle cell disease  newborn screening for a large number of hemoglobinopathies is done by detecting abnormal patterns using isoelectric focusing which can detect many different types of abnormal hemoglobins  in the united states newborn screening for sickle cell disease was recommended for all infants in 1987 however it was not implemented in all 50 states until 2006  early identification of individuals with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies allows treatment to be initiated in a timely fashion penicillin has been used in children with sickle cell disease and blood transfusions are used for patients identified with severe thalassemia  most jurisdictions did not start screening for any of the organic acidemias before tandem mass spectrometry significantly expanded the list of disorders detectable by newborn screening quebec has run a voluntary secondtier screening program since 1971 using urine samples collected at three weeks of age to screen for an expanded list of organic acidemias using a thin layer chromatography method  newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry can detect several organic acidemias including propionic acidemia methylmalonic acidemia and isovaleric acidemia cystic fibrosis cf was first added to newborn screening programs in new zealand and regions of australia in 1981 by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen irt in dried blood spots  after the cftr gene was identified australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of false positives samples with an elevated irt value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers  cf is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states texas was the last state to implement their screening program for cf in 2010  alberta was the first canadian province to implement cf screening in 2007  quebec new brunswick nova scotia newfoundland and prince edward island do not include cf in their screening programs  the united kingdom as well as many european union countries screen for cf as well  switzerland is one of the latest countries to add cf to their newborn screening menu doing so in january 2011  disorders of the distal urea cycle such as citrullinemia argininosuccinic aciduria and argininemia are included in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids proximal urea cycle defects such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency are not included in newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available some regions claim to screen for hhh syndrome hyperammonemia hyperornithinemia homocitrullinuria based on the detection of elevated ornithine levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated ornithine at birth  lysosomal storage disorders are not included in newborn screening programs with high frequency as a group they are heterogenous with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders the arguments for their inclusion in newborn screening programs center around the advantage of early treatment when treatment is available avoiding a diagnostic odyssey for families and providing information for family planning to couples who have an affected child  the arguments against including these disorders as a group or individually center around the difficulties with reliably identifying individuals who will be affected with a severe form of the disorder the relatively unproven nature of the treatment methods and the high cost  high risk associated with some treatment options  new york state started a pilot study to screen for krabbe disease in 2006 largely due to the efforts of jim kelly whose son hunter was affected with the disease  a pilot screening program for four lysosomal storage diseases gaucher disease pompe disease fabry disease and niemannpick disease was undertaken using anonymised dried blood spots was completed in austria in 2010 their data showed an increased incidence from what was expected in the population and also a number of late onset forms of disease which are not typically the target for newborn screening programs  undiagnosed hearing loss in a child can have serious effects on many developmental areas including language social interactions emotions cognitive ability academic performance and vocational skills any combination of which can have negative impacts on the quality of life  the serious impacts of a late diagnosis combined with the high incidence estimated at 1  3 per 1000 live births and as high as 4 for neonatal intensive care unit patients have been the driving forces behind screening programs designed to identify infants with hearing loss as early as possible early identification allows these patients and their families to access needed resources to help them develop  newborn hearing testing is done at the bedside using transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions automated auditory brainstem responses or a combination of both techniques hearing screening programs have found the initial testing to cost between 1020 and 2337 per baby depending on the technology used  as these are screening tests only false positive results will occur a review of hearing screening programs found varied initial referral rates screen positive results from 06 to 167 the highest overall incidence of hearing loss detection was 0517  a significant proportion of screen positive infants were lost to followup before a diagnosis could be confirmed or ruled out in all screening programs  pulse oximetry has been recently added as a bedside screening test for critical congenital heart defects  severe combined immunodeficiency scid caused by tcell deficiency is a disorder that was recently added to newborn screening programs in some regions of the united states wisconsin was the first state to add scid to their mandatory screening panel in 2008 and it was recommended for inclusion in all states panels in 2010 identification of infants with scid is done by detecting tcell receptor excision circles trecs using realtime polymerase chain reaction qpcr trecs are decreased in infants affected with scid  scid has not been added to newborn screening in a wide scale for several reasons it requires technology that is not currently used in most newborn screening labs as pcr is not used for any other assays included in screening programs followup and treatment of affected infants also requires skilled immunologists which may not be available in all regions treatment for scid is a stem cell transplant which cannot be done in all centers  duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd is an xlinked disorder caused by defective production of dystrophin many jurisdictions around the world have screened for or attempted to screen for dmd using elevated levels of creatine kinase measured in dried blood spots because universal newborn screening for dmd has not been undertaken affected individuals often have a significant delay in diagnosis as treatment options for dmd become more and more effective interest in adding a newborn screening test increases at various times since 1978 dmd has been included often as a pilot study on a small subset of the population in newborn screening programs in edinburgh germany canada france wales cyprus belgium and the united states in 2012 belgium was the only country that continued to screen for dmd using creatine kinase levels  as treatments improve newborn screening becomes a possibility for disorders that could benefit from early intervention but none was previously available adrenoleukodystrophy ald a peroxisomal disease that has a variable clinical presentation is one of the disorders that has become a target for those seeking to identify patients early ald can present in several different forms some of which do not present until adulthood making it a difficult choice for countries to add to screening programs the most successful treatment option is a stem cell transplant a procedure that carries a significant risk  eye and vision screening that can be performed within the few months of life include strabismus screening using the hirschberg test or more recently using binocular retinal birefringence screening for higher precision and retinoblastoma screening using the red reflex further eye examination may be called for in some cases newborn screening programs participate in quality control programs as in any other laboratory with some notable exceptions much of the success of newborn screening programs is dependent on the filter paper used for the collection of the samples initial studies using robert guthries test for pku reported high false positive rates that were attributed to a poorly selected type of filter paper  this source of variation has been eliminated in most newborn screening programs through standardization of approved sources of filter paper for use in newborn screening programs in most regions the newborn screening card which contains demographic information as well as attached filter paper for blood collection is supplied by the organization carrying out the testing to remove variations from this source  newborn screening tests have become a subject of political controversy in the last decade in 2003 two california babies zachary wyvill and zachary black were both born with glutaric acidemia type i wyvills birth hospital only tested for the four diseases mandated by state law while black was born at a hospital that was participating in an expanded testing pilot program blacks disease was treated with diet and vitamins wyvills disease went undetected for over six months and during that time the damage from the enzyme deficiency became irreversible  birthdefects lobbyists pushing for broader and more universal standards for newborn testing cite this as an example of how much of an impact testing can have  instituting msms screening often requires a sizable up front expenditure when states choose to run their own programs the initial costs for equipment training and new staff can be significant moreover msms gives only the screening result and not the confirmatory result the same has to be further done by higher technologies or procedure like gcms enzyme assays or dna tests this in effect adds more cost burden and makes physicians lose precious time to avoid at least a portion of the up front costs some states such as mississippi have chosen to contract with private labs for expanded screening others have chosen to form regional partnerships  sharing both costs and resources but for many states screening is an integrated part of the department of health which can not or will not be easily replaced thus the initial expenditures can be difficult for states with tight budgets to justify screening fees have also increased in recent years as health care costs rise and as more states add msms screening to their programs see report of summation of fees charged for newborn screening 20012005 dollars spent for these programs may reduce resources available to other potentially lifesaving programs it has been recommended that one disorder short chain acylcoenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency or scad be eliminated from screening programs due to a spurious association between scad and symptoms  however recent studies suggest that expanded screening is cost effective see acmg report page 9495 and articles published in pediatrics   advocates are quick to point out studies such as these when trying to convince state legislatures to mandate expanded screening expanded newborn screening is also opposed by among some health care providers who are concerned that effective followup and treatment may not be available that false positive screening tests may cause harm and issues of informed consent  a recent study by genetic alliance and partners suggests that communication between health care providers and parents may be key in minimizing the potential harm when a false positive test occurs the results from this study also reveal that parents found newborn screening to be a beneficial and necessary tool to prevent treatable diseases  to address the false positive issue researchers from the university of maryland baltimore and genetic alliance established a checklist to assist health care providers communicate with parents about a screenpositive result  controversy has also erupted in some countries over collection and storage of blood or dna samples by government agencies during the routine newborn blood screen it was revealed that in texas the state had collected and stored blood and dna samples on millions of newborns without the parents knowledge or consent these samples were then used by the state for genetic experiments and to set up a database to catalog all of the samplesnewborns samples obtained without parents consent were destroyed  as additional tests are discussed for addition to the panels issues arise many question if the expanded testing still falls under the requirements necessary to justify the additional tests  many of the new diseases being tested for are rare and have no known treatment while some of the diseases need not be treated until later in life  this raises more issues such as if there is no available treatment for the disease should we test for it at all and if we do what do we tell the families of those with children bearing one of the untreatable diseases  studies show that the more rare the disease is and the more diseases being tested for the more likely the tests are to produce falsepositives  this is an issue because the newborn period is a crucial time for the parents to bond with the child and it has been noted that ten percent of parents whose children were diagnosed with a falsepositive still worried that their child was fragile andor sickly even though they were not potentially preventing the parentchild bond forming as it would have otherwise  as a result some parents may begin to opt out of having their newborns screened many parents are also concerned about what happens with their infants blood samples after screening the samples were originally taken to test for preventable diseases but with the advance in genomic sequencing technologies many samples are being kept for dna identification and research   increasing the possibility that more children will be opted out of newborn screening from parents who see the kept samples as a form of research done on their child

V congenital insensitivity to pain cip also known as congenital analgesia is one or more rare conditions in which a person cannot feel and has never felt physical pain the conditions described here are separate from the hsan group of disorders which have more specific signs and etiology it is an extremely dangerous condition   for people with this disorder cognition and sensation are otherwise normal for instance patients can still feel discriminative touch though not always temperature  and there are no detectable physical abnormalities children with this condition often suffer oral cavity damage both in and around the oral cavity such as having bitten off the tip of their tongue or fractures to bones unnoticed infections and corneal damage due to foreign objects in the eye are also seen because the child cannot feel pain they may not respond to problems thus being at a higher risk of more severe diseases there are generally two types of nonresponse exhibited there are some cases where the condition is caused by increased production of endorphins in the brain  in which case naloxone may be used as treatment this treatment does not always work  in all cases this disorder can be in the voltagegated sodium channel scn9a nav17 patients with such mutations are congenitally insensitive to pain and lack other neuropathies there are three mutations in scn9a w897x located in the ploop of domain 2 i767x located in the s2 segment of domain 2 and s459x located in the linker region between domains 1 and 2 this results in a truncated nonfunctional protein nav17 channels are expressed at high levels in nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia as these channels are likely involved in the formation and propagation of action potentials in such neurons it is expected that a loss of function mutation in scn9a will lead to abolished nociceptive pain propagation  prdm12 gene is normally switched on during the development of painsensing nerve cells people with homozygous mutations of the prdm12 gene experience congenital insensitivity to pain cip   developmental disabilities such as autism can include varying degrees of pain insensitivity as a sign  however since these disorders are characterized by dysfunction of the sensory system in general this specific condition is not in itself an indicator of any of these conditions the opioid antagonist naloxone was recently found to allow a woman with congenital insensitivity to pain to experience it for the first time  similar effects were observed in nav17 null mice treated with naloxone  as such opioid antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone may be effective in treating the condition  congenital insensitivity to pain is found in vittangi a village in kiruna municipality in northern sweden where nearly 40 cases have been reported a few americans also have it  in the millennium series by swedish author stieg larsson the character ronald niedermann is presented as suffering from the condition rendering him an overtly stereotypical henchman which includes precipitating several plot devices in the series

V duane syndrome is a congenital rare type of strabismus most commonly characterized by the inability of the eye to move outwards the syndrome was first described by ophthalmologists jakob stilling 1887 and siegmund türk 1896 and subsequently named after alexander duane who discussed the disorder in more detail in 1905  other names for this condition include duanes retraction syndrome eye retraction syndrome retraction syndrome congenital retraction syndrome and stillingtürkduane syndrome    the characteristic features of the syndrome are while usually isolated to the eye abnormalities duane syndrome can be associated with other problems including cervical spine abnormalities klippelfeil syndrome goldenhar syndrome heterochromia and congenital deafness  duane syndrome is most probably a miswiring of the eye muscles causing some eye muscles to contract when they shouldnt and other eye muscles not to contract when they should  alexandrakis and saunders found that in most cases the abducens nucleus and nerve are absent or hypoplastic and the lateral rectus muscle is innervated by a branch of the oculomotor nerve  this view is supported by the earlier work of hotchkiss et al who reported on the autopsy findings of two patients with duanes syndrome in both cases the sixth cranial nerve nucleus and nerve was absent and the lateral rectus muscle was innervated by the inferior division of the third or oculomotor nerve this misdirection of nerve fibres results in opposing muscles being innervated by the same nerve thus on attempted abduction stimulation of the lateral rectus via the oculomotor nerve will be accompanied by stimulation of the opposing medial rectus via the same nerve a muscle which works to adduct the eye thus cocontraction of the muscles takes place limiting the amount of movement achievable and also resulting in retraction of the eye into the socket they also noticed mechanical factors and considered them secondary to loss of innervation during corrective surgery fibrous attachments have been found connecting the horizontal recti and the orbital walls and fibrosis of the lateral rectus has been confirmed by biopsy this fibrosis can result in the lateral rectus being tight and acting as a tether or leash cocontraction of the medial and lateral recti allows the globe to slip up or down under the tight lateral rectus producing the up and down shoots characteristic of the condition  the gene sallike 4 sall4 has been implicated as a cause of this condition  most patients are diagnosed by the age of 10 years and duanes is more common in girls 60 percent of the cases than boys 40 percent of the cases a french study reports that this syndrome accounts for 19 of the population of strabismic patients 535 of patients are female is unilateral in 78 of cases and the left eye 719 is affected more frequently than the right  around 1020 of cases are familial these are more likely to be bilateral than nonfamilial duane syndrome duane syndrome has no particular race predilection duanes syndrome has three variants the first type is more common and accounts for 85 of the cases   in the clinical setting the principal difficulties in differential diagnosis arise as a consequence of the very early age at which patients with this condition first present the clinician must be persistent in examining abduction and adduction and in looking for any associated palpebral fissure changes or head postures when attempting to determine whether what often presents as a common childhood squint notesquint is a british term for two eyes not looking in the same direction  is in fact duane syndrome fissure changes and the other associated characteristics of duanes such as up or down shoots and globe retraction are also vital when deciding whether any abduction limitation is the result of duanes and not a consequence of vi or abducens cranial nerve palsy acquired duanes syndrome is a rare event occurring after peripheral nerve palsy  the majority of patients remain symptom free and able to maintain binocularity with only a slight face turn amblyopia is uncommon and where present rarely dense this can be treated with occlusion and any refractive error can also be corrected duane syndrome cannot be cured as the missing cranial nerve cannot be replaced and traditionally there has been no expectation that surgery will result in any increase in the range of eye movement surgical intervention therefore has only been recommended where the patient is unable to maintain binocularity where they are experiencing symptoms or where they are forced to adopt a cosmetically unsightly or uncomfortable head posture in order to maintain binocularity the aims of surgery are to place the eye in a more central position and thus place the field of binocularity more centrally also and to overcome or reduce the need for the adoption of an abnormal head posture occasionally surgery is not needed during childhood but becomes appropriate later in life as head position changes presumably due to progressive muscle contracture surgical approaches include

V the vacterl association also vater association refers to the nonrandom cooccurrence of birth defects vertebral anomalies anal atresia cardiac defects tracheoesophageal fistula andor esophageal atresia renal  radial anomalies and limb defects the reason it is called an association rather than a syndrome is that while the complications are not pathogenically related they tend to occur together more frequently than expected by chance in general the etiology of associations is not defined each child with this condition can be unique at present this condition is treated after birth with issues being approached one at a time some infants are born with symptoms that cannot be fixed and they do not survive causes of this association are debated though it appears to be genetic according to certain studies also vacterl association can be linked to other similar conditions such as klippel feil and goldenhar syndrome including crossovers of conditions no specific genetic or chromosome problem has been identified with vacterl association vacterl can be seen with some chromosomal defects such as trisomy 18 and is more frequently seen in babies of diabetic mothers vacterl association however is most likely caused by multiple factors  vacterl association specifically refers to the abnormalities in structures derived from the embryonic mesoderm   the acronym vater association was first described by linda quan an emergency room physician and david smith a man who was considered the father of dysmorphology in 1972 to define a nonrandom cooccurrence of the listed defects years later research revealed that cardiac and renal abnormalities were common in the association and the acronym was changed to vacterl  the differentiation of the acronyms vacterl and vater is due to the variation in defects determined at or prior to birth vacterl contains vertebral anal cardiac tracheaesophogeal renalkidney and limb defects where as vater only has vertebral anal tracheaesophogeal and renal defects the r in vater represented radial dysplasia though the differences are clear the visual and physical defects vary from case to case the following features are observed with vacterl association   although it was not conclusive whether vacterl should be defined by at least two or three component defects  it is typically defined by the presence of at least three of the above congenital malformations  vertebral anomalies or defects of the spinal column usually consist of small hypoplastic vertebrae or hemivertebra where only one half of the bone is formed about 80 percent of patients with vacterl association will have vertebral anomalies  in early life these rarely cause any difficulties although the presence of these defects on a chest xray may alert the physician to other defects associated with vacterl later in life these spinal column abnormalities may put the child at risk for developing scoliosis or curvature of the spine anal atresia or imperforate anus is seen in about 55 percent of patients with vacterl association these anomalies are usually noted at birth and often require surgery in the first days of life sometimes babies will require several surgeries to fully reconstruct the intestine and anal canal up to 75 percent of patients with vacterl association have been reported to have congenital heart disease  the most common heart defects seen with vacterl association are ventricular septal defect vsd atrial septal defects and tetralogy of fallot less common defects are truncus arteriosus and transposition of the great arteries it is subsequently thought that cardiac defects should be considered an extension of vacterl  esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula te fistula is seen in about 70 percent of patients with vacterl association although it can frequently occur as an isolated defect fifteen percent to 33 percent of patients with te fistulas will also have congenital heart disease however these babies usually have uncomplicated heart defects like a ventricular septal defect which may not require any surgery renal kidney defects are seen in approximately 50 percent of patients with vacterl association in addition up to 35 percent of patients with vacterl association have a single umbilical artery there are usually two arteries and one vein which is often associated with additional kidney or urologic problems renal abnormalities in vacterl association can be severe with incomplete formation of one or both kidneys or urologic abnormalities such as obstruction of outflow of urine from the kidneys or severe reflux backflow of urine into the kidneys from the bladder these problems can cause kidney failure early in life and may require kidney transplant many of these problems can be corrected surgically before any damage can occur limb defects occur in up to 70 percent of babies with vacterl association and include a displaced or hypoplastic thumb extra digits polydactyly fusion of digits syndactyly and forearm defects such as radial aplasia babies with limb defects on both sides tend to have kidney or urologic defects on both sides while babies with limb defects on only one side of the body tend to have kidney problems on that same side features secondary to vacterl components including single umbilical artery ambiguous genitalia abdominal wall defects diaphragmatic hernia and anomalies like intestinal and respiratory anomalies and oligohydramnios sequence defects are frequent enough to be considered an extension of vacterl   cardiac defects are thought to fit in this category  many babies with vacterl are born small and have difficulty with gaining weight babies with vacterl association however do tend to have normal development and normal intelligence although children with vacterl may have a more active brain some children are said to have a higher iq and are able to work through wordnumbershape problems more easily usually this has to do with the children being hyper metabolic the incidence of vacterl association is estimated to be approximately 1 in 10000 to 1 in 40000 liveborn infants  it is seen more frequently in infants born to diabetic mothers while most cases are sporadic there are clearly families who present with multiple involved members patients with abnormal cardiac and kidney function may be more at risk for hemolytic uremic syndrome

V anotia no ear describes a rare congenital deformity that involves the complete absence of the pinna the outer projected portion of the ear and narrowing or absence of the ear canal this contrasts with microtia in which a small part of the pinna is present anotia and microtia may occur unilaterally only one ear affected or bilaterally both ears affected this deformity results in conductive hearing loss deafness   ear development begins in about the third week of human embryonic development beginning with the formation of the otic placodes which are an extension of the early hind brain by the fourth week of development the otic placodes invaginate or sink inward forming pits which close themselves off for the outer surface ectoderm and begin forming the inner ear labyrinthe on the inside outer ear development begins in about the fifth week of human embryonic development upon the pharyngeal arches auricle hillocks begin to form by the seventh week the three pairs of hillocks have enlarged differentiated and fused together to start forming the pinna or out portion of the ear throughout fetal development the hillocks will move from the sides of the neck to the sides of the head simultaneously in the seventh week of development the auditory tube begins to form out of the tympanic membrane the human ear is divided into three sections each section has possesses its own specialized function 1 the outer ear acts like a funnel and takes in the sound 2 the middle ear holds the tympanic membrane or ear drum and several little bones that are moved by the sound waves that have entered the ear via the canal these movements are very small like vibrations and are transmitted to the inner ear 3 the inner ear contains a structure called the cochlea which contains small hair like cells that respond to sound information and transmits it via nerve impulses down the auditory nerve and to the brain where they are processed the isolated cause a cause not associated with a syndrome of anotia or microtia is not known though it is believed to be of genetic basis developmentally anotiamicrotia occurs when certain tissues associated with the auricle do not develop this rare defect may occur as part of a syndrome or as an isolated abnormality this defect is able to be classified into four types depending on the extent of the anomaly  type i external portion of the ear is small in size auricle structure is normal type ii the auricle is in a hook or s shape external ear is only moderately abnormal type iii small amount of basic soft tissue ear structure lacking cartilage auricle is abnormal in appearance type iv most severe type anotia all external structures of the ears are absent defects affecting the external ear such as the auricle results from malformation or suppression of the auricular hillocks which are small swellings on the embryonic visceral arches or the beginnings of the external ears the small swellings are derived from the first and second pharyngeal arches because the ears and the kidneys develop simultaneously children with ear defects are often checked for kidney defects at birth 20 to 40 of children with microtiaanotia will have additional defects that could suggest a syndrome   treachercollins syndrome tcs a congenital disorder caused by a defective protein known as treacle and is characterized by craniofacial deformities malformed or absent ears are also seen in this syndrome the effects may be mild undiagnosed to severe leading to death because the ear defects are much different in this disorder and not only affect the outer ear but the middle ear as well reconstructive surgery may not help with the childs hearing and in this case a bone anchored hearing aid would be best baha will only work however if the inner ear and nerve are intact goldenhar syndrome a rare congenital birth defect that causes abnormalities of facial development also known as oculoauricular dysplasia the facial anomalies include underdeveloped asymmetric half of the face the defect is capable of affecting tissue muscle and the underlying bone structure of the side of the face with the abnormality ablepharonmacrostomia syndrome ams a rare genetic disorder characterized by various physical anomalies which affect the craniofacial area the skin the fingers and the genitals the treatment will vary with the different grades but the most common is a surgical repair the surgical option is cosmetic reconstruction of the external ears normal shape and repair of the ear canal in less severe cases the reconstruction will be sufficient to restore hearing in grades of anotiamicrotia that affect the middle ear the surgery with the use of a bone anchored hearing aid baha will likely restore the hearing the baha may be surgically implanted onto the skull which would allow for some hearing repair by conduction through the skull bone this allows sound vibrations to travel through bones in the head to the inner ear   baha an implantable hearing device it is the only hearing aid device that works via direct bone conduction  most children with an isolated form of bilateral or unilateral anotiamicrotia do well after corrective surgery and there are no adverse effects on the childs development as this surgery is typically performed in the childs early years common complications post surgery common obstacles in healing for those who received the corrective surgery include infections poor wound healing and excessive scarring

V cretinism is a condition of severely stunted physical and mental growth due to untreated congenital deficiency of thyroid hormones congenital hypothyroidism usually due to maternal hypothyroidism   congenital hypothyroidism can be endemic genetic or sporadic if untreated it results in mild to severe impairment of both physical and mental growth and development poor length growth is apparent as early as the first year of life adult stature without treatment ranges from 1 to 16 metres 33 to 52ft depending on severity sex and other genetic factors in adults cretinism results in mental deterioration swelling of the skin loss of water and hair  bone maturation and puberty are severely delayed ovulation is impeded and infertility is common neurological impairment may be mild with reduced muscle tone and coordination or so severe that the person cannot stand or walk cognitive impairment may also range from mild to so severe that the person is nonverbal and dependent on others for basic care thought and reflexes are slower other signs may include thickened skin enlarged tongue or a protruding abdomen sporadic and genetic cretinism results from abnormal development or function of the foetal thyroid gland this type of cretinism has been almost completely eliminated in developed countries by early diagnosis by newborn screening schemes followed by lifelong treatment with thyroxine t4 thyroxine must be dosed as tablets only even to newborns as the liquid oral suspensions and compounded forms cannot be depended on for reliable dosing in the case of dosing infants the t4 tablets are generally crushed and mixed with breast milk formula milk or water if the medication is mixed with formulas containing iron or soya products larger doses may be required as these substances may alter the absorption of thyroid hormone from the gut  frequent monitoring every 23 weeks during the first months of life is recommended to ensure that infants with congenital hypothyroidism remain within the high end of normal range or euthyroid around the world the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is iodine deficiency cretinism is therefore most probably due to a diet deficient in iodine it has affected many people worldwide and continues to be a major public health problem in many countries iodine is an essential trace element necessary primarily for the synthesis of thyroid hormones iodine deficiency is the most common preventable cause of brain damage worldwide  although iodine is found in many foods it is not universally present in all soils in adequate amounts most iodine in iodide form is in the oceans where the iodide ions oxidize to elemental iodine which then enters the atmosphere and falls to earth as rain introducing iodine to soils earth deficient in iodine is most common inland and in mountainous areas and areas of frequent flooding but can also occur in coastal regions owing to past glaciation and leaching by snow water and heavy rainfall which removes iodine from the soil  plants and animals grown in iodine deficient soils are correspondingly deficient populations living in those areas without outside food sources are most at risk of iodine deficiency diseases  iodine deficiency results in the impairments in varying degrees of physical and mental development it also causes gradual enlargement of the thyroid gland referred to as a goitre it is being combated in many countries by public health campaigns of iodine administration goiter is the most specific clinical marker of either the direct or indirect insufficient intake of iodine in the human body there is evidence of goiter and its medical treatment with irich algae and burnt sponges in chinese egyptian and roman ancient medical texts in 1848 the italian king carlo alberto of sardinia commissioned the first epidemiological study of goiter and cretinism in his hautesavoy territories where hideous cases of goiters and cretinism frequently occurred in the population in past centuries the well reported social diseases prevalent among the poorer social classes and farmers caused by dietary and agricultural monocultures were pellagra rickets beriberi scurvy in longterm sailors and the endemic goiter caused by ideficiency however this disease was less mentioned in medical books because it was erroneously considered to be an aesthetic rather than a clinical disorder  endemic cretinism was especially common in areas of southern europe around the alps and was described by ancient roman writers and often depicted by medieval artists the earliest alpine mountain climbers sometimes came upon whole villages of cretins  alpine cretinism was described from a medical perspective by several travellers and physicians in the late 18th and early 19th centuries  at that time the cause was not known and it was often attributed to stagnant air in mountain valleys or bad water the proportion of people affected varied markedly throughout southern europe and even within very small areas it might be common in one valley and not another the number of severely affected persons was always a minority and most persons were only affected to the extent of having a goitre and some degree of reduced cognition and growth the majority of such cases were still socially functional in their pastoral villages more mildly affected areas of europe and north america in the 19th century were referred to as goitre belts the degree of iodine deficiency was milder and manifested primarily as thyroid enlargement rather than severe mental and physical impairment in switzerland for example where soil does not contain a large amount of iodine cases of cretinism were very abundant and even considered genetically caused as the variety of food sources dramatically increased in europe and north america and the populations became less completely dependent on locally grown food the prevalence of endemic goitre diminished the early 20th century saw the discovery of the relationships of sporadic cretinism with congenital hypothyroidism and of endemic cretinism with hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency both have been largely eliminated in the developed world the term cretin was once used to describe a person affected by cretinism but as with words such as spastic and lunatic it is now considered derogatory and inappropriate  cretin became a medical term in the 18th century from an occitan and an alpine french expression prevalent in a region where persons with such a condition were especially common see below it saw wide medical use in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was actually a tick box category on victorianera census forms in the uk the term spread more widely in popular english as a markedly derogatory term for a person who behaves stupidly because of its pejorative connotations in popular speech healthcare workers have mostly abandoned cretin  the etymology of cretin is uncertain several hypotheses exist the most common derivation provided in english dictionaries is from the alpine french dialect pronunciation of the word chrétien a christian which was a greeting there according to the oxford english dictionary the translation of the french term into human creature implies that the label christian is a reminder of the humanity of the afflicted in contrast to brute beasts  other sources suggest that christian describes the persons christlike inability to sin stemming in such cases from an incapacity to distinguish right from wrong   other speculative etymologies have been offered

V oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant drug primarily used in the treatment of epilepsy  there is some evidence for oxcarbazepine as a moodstabilizing agent and thus it can be used as addon therapy for bipolar disorder in patients that have failed or are unable to tolerate approved treatments   common side effects include nausea vomiting dizziness drowsiness headache double vision and trouble with walking  although not common anaphylaxis may occur  due to its structural similarities to carbamazepine there is approximately a 2530 chance of crossreactivity between the two medications  oxcarbazepine is marketed as trileptal by novartis and available in some countries as a generic drug  there is also an extendedrelease formation marketed as oxtellar xr by supernus pharmaceuticals    oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant used to reduce the occurrence of epileptic episodes and is not intended to cure epilepsy  oxcarbazepine is used alone or in combination with other medications for the treatment of focal partial seizures in adults  in pediatric populations it can be used by itself for the treatment of partial seizures for children 4 years and older or in combination with other medications for children 2 years and older  in addition oxcarbazepine has been shown to improve mood and reduce anxiety therefore it is a potential option for addon therapy in the treatment of bipolar disorder   oxcarbazepine is listed as pregnancy category c  currently there is limited data analyzing the impact of oxcarbazepine on a human fetus  animal studies have shown an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats and rabbits treated with oxcarbazepine during pregnancy  in addition oxcarbazepine is structurally similar to carbamazepine pregnancy category d which is considered to be teratogenic in humans   oxcarbazepine should only be used in pregnancy if the benefits justify the risks  pregnant persons on oxcarbazepine should be closely monitored as plasma levels of the active metabolite mhd has been shown to potentially decrease during pregnancy  oxcarbazepine and mhd are both present in human breast milk and thus some of the active drug can be transferred to a nursing infant  when considering whether to continue this medication in nursing mothers the impact of the drugs side effect profile on the infant should be weighed against its antiepileptic benefit for the mother  the most common side effects associated with oxcarbazepine include  other rare side effects of oxcarbazepine include  serum sodium levels should be considered in maintenance treatment or symptoms of hyponatremia develop  some side effects such as headache are more pronounced shortly after a dose is taken and tend to fade with the passage of time 60 to 90 minutes other side effects include stomach pain tremor rash diarrhea constipation decreased appetite and dry mouth photosensitivity is a potential sideeffect and people could experience severe sunburns as a result of sun exposure  some people reported a sensation of incontinence without cause after taking the drug  oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite mhd have been shown to exhibit drug interactions when indicated with medications that are metabolized via cyp 450  oxcarbazepine and mhd is a potent inhibitor of cyp2c19 and thus has the potential to increase plasma concentration of drugs that are metabolized through this pathway placing the patient at higher risk for toxicities  example of cyp2c19 substrates include phenytoin citalopram diazepam imipramine omeprazole propranolol amitriptyline and progesterone when administered together  in addition oxcarbazepine and mhd are cyp3a4  cyp3a5 inducers and thus have the potential to decrease the plasma concentration and therapeutic efficacy of medications that are cyp3a substrates  examples of cyp3a4 substrates include dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist and oral contraceptives  due to the increase in drug metabolism of cyp3a4 substrates hormonal contraceptives might be less effective placing females at a greater risk of pregnancy    furthermore oxcarbazepine has been shown to interact with other anticonvulsant medications when used in combination  for example phenytoin and phenobarbital are known cyp inducers and thus have the potential to decrease the plasma concentration of oxcarbazepines active metabolite mhd  oxcarbazepine has great bioavailability once it is administrated orally as tablets  upon absorption oxcarbazepine is largely metabolized to its pharmacological active 10 monohydroxy metabolite mhd  during a study in humans the unchanged oxcarbazepine was found to be about 2 of the total radioactivity while mhd presented 70 and the rest representing the minor metabolites  the halflife of oxcarbazepine is considered to be about 2 hours whereas the active metabolite mhd has a halflife of nine hours therefore the antiepileptic activity can be attributed to mhd  both oxcarbazepine and its mhd the active metabolite were found to show anticonvulsant properties in seizure models done on animals  these compounds had protective functions whenever tonic extension seizures were induced electrically but such protection was less apparent whenever seizures were induced chemically  there was no observable tolerance during a four weeks course of treatment with daily administration of oxcarbazepine or mhd in electroshock test on mice and rats  oxcarbazepine and mhd exert their action by blocking voltagesensitive sodium channels thus leading to the stabilization of hyper excited neural membranes suppression of repetitive neuronal firing and diminishment propagation of synaptic impulses  furthermore anticonvulsant effects of these compounds could be attributed to enhanced potassium conductance and modulation of highvoltage activated calcium channels  since the structure of oxcarbazepine is similar to carbamazepine there is a consideration for genetic testing in patients who are of asian descent mainly populations of han chinese 212 thai 8 philippines 15 malaysia due to the higher frequency of the hlab1502 allele  human leukocyte antigen hla allele b1502 has been associated with an increased incidence of stevensjohnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis  oxcarbazepine is a structural derivative of carbamazepine with a ketone in place of the carboncarbon double bond on the dibenzazepine ring at the 10 position 10keto this difference helps reduce the impact on the liver of metabolizing the drug and also prevents the serious forms of anemia or agranulocytosis occasionally associated with carbamazepine  aside from this reduction in side effects it is thought to have the same mechanism as carbamazepine  sodium channel inhibition presumed to be the main mechanism of action  and is generally used to treat the same conditions oxcarbazepine is a prodrug which is activated to eslicarbazepine in the liver  first made in 1965  it was patentprotected by geigy in 1969 through de 2011087 it was approved for use as an anticonvulsant in denmark in 1990 spain in 1993 portugal in 1997 and eventually for all other eu countries in 1999 it was approved in the us in 2000  in september 2010 novartis pled guilty to marketing trileptal for the unapproved uses of neuropathic pain and bipolar disorder

V nasodigitoacoustic syndrome also called keipert syndrome is a rare congenital syndrome first described by ja keipert and colleagues in 1973 the syndrome is characterized by a mishaped nose broad thumbs and halluces the big toes brachydactyly sensorineural hearing loss facial features such as hypertelorism unusually wideset eyes and developmental delay it is believed to be inherited in an xlinked recessive manner which means a genetic mutation causing the disorder is located on the x chromosome and while two copies of the mutated gene must be inherited for a female to be born with the disorder just one copy is sufficient to cause a male to be born with the disorder nasodigitoacoustic syndrome is likely caused by a mutated gene located on the x chromosome between positions xq222q28 the incidence of the syndrome has not been determined but it is considered to affect less than 200000 people in the united states and no greater than 1 per 2000 in europe it is similar to keutel muenke rubinstein and teunissencremers syndrome        nasodigitoacoustic syndrome is congenital and is characterized by a number of nasal facial and cranial features these include a broad and high sometimes depressed nasal bridge top of the nose between the eyes and a flattened nasal tip    this can give the nose a shortened archlike appearance  hypertelorism unusually wideset eyes  prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge the eyebrow ridge bilateral epicanthic folds an extra flap of skin over the eyelids a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed a bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupids bow shape  and maxillary hypoplasia underdevelopment of the upper jaw with retraction have also been reported    several anomalies affecting the digits fingers and toes have been observed with the syndrome a broadening of the thumbs and big toes halluces was reported in two brothers the broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the fingers although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic warped or bent toward the other fingers  additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes with brachydactyly shortness in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals on xrays of a twoyearold boy with the disorder the brachydactyly was shown to be caused by shortening of epiphyses jointends of the distal phalanges   the broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted rounded and stublike appearance  the auditory or acoustic abnormalities observed with the syndrome include sensorineural hearing loss and hoarseness two affected turkish brothers with a mild form of this hearing loss and a hoarse voice were reported a laryngoscopic examination of both brothers revealed swelling of the vocal cords and a malformed epiglottis  sensorineuralassociated hearing impairment and hoarsness was also observed in a 10yearold girl and her father  and in a number of other cases   other characteristics seen with the syndrome include developmental delay growth retardation pulmonary stenosis an obstruction of bloodflow from the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery with associated dyspnea shortness of breath and renal agenesis failure of the kidneys to develop during the fetal period undescended testes hyperactivity and aggressive behavior have also been noted    nasodigitoacoustic syndrome is thought to be caused by a mutation in a gene on the x chromosome a 2007 study concluded based on analysis of microsatellite markers small gene sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity ancestry or genetic disease of the family described by keipert that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the x chromosome between positions xq222q28 this is not definitive however and no specific gene has been named  the syndrome is strongly believed to be inherited in an xlinked recessive manner  when a female carries a mutated gene on one of her two copies of the x chromosome there is a 50 chance of passing the mutation on to her children much like her a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier but will not herself have the associated disease however a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease this is because males have only one copy of the x chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation this form of inheritance for nasodigitoacoustic syndrome is not yet absolute though as a girl has been reported with the disorder it is suggested that further analysis is needed for the inheritance to be formally established   the constellation of anomalies seen with nasodigitoacoustic syndrome result in a distinct diagnosis the diagnostic criteria for the disorder are broad distal phalanges of the thumbs and big toes accompanied by a broad and shortened nose sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay with predominant occurrence in males   nasodigitoacoustic syndrome is similar to several syndromes that share its features   brachydactyly of the distal phalanges sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with keutel syndrome  in muenke syndrome developmental delay distal brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported features of teunissencremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs and big toes also with brachydactyly   broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of rubinstein syndrome  a number of features found with nasodigitoacoustic syndrome can be managed or treated sensorineural hearing loss in humans may be caused by a loss of hair cells sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing this can be hereditary andor within a syndrome as is the case with nasodigitoacoustic syndrome  or attributed to infections such as viruses for the management of sensorineural hearing loss hearing aids have been used treatments depending upon the cause and severity may include a pharmacological approach ie the use of certain steroids or surgical intervention like a cochlear implant    pulmonary or pulmonic stenosis is an often congenital narrowing of the pulmonary valve it can be present in nasodigitoacousticaffected infants  treatment of this cardiac abnormality can require surgery or nonsurgical procedures like balloon valvuloplasty widening the valve with a balloon catheter  the syndrome was initially described in 1973 by james a keipert and associates they reported of two brothers with broad distal phalanges sensorineural hearing loss and facial features consistent with what would become known as keipert or nasodigitoacoustic syndrome   although no specific rate of incidence has been determined the syndrome is considered a rare disease by both the office of rare diseases ordr at the national institutes of health and orphanet this suggests respectively that nasodigitoacoustic syndrome affects less than 200000 people in the us or affects no greater than 1 per 2000 people in europe

V endocardial fibroelastosis efe is a rare heart disorder usually occurring in children two years old and younger  it may also be considered a reaction to stress not necessarily a specific disease  it should not be confused with endomyocardial fibrosis   efe is characterized by a thickening of the innermost lining of the heart chambers the endocardium due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue and elastic fibers it is an uncommon cause of unexplained heart failure in infants and children and is one component of hec syndrome fibroelastosis is strongly seen as a primary cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in children along with cardiac amyloidosis which is more commonly seen in progressive multiple myeloma patients and the elderly  a recent review cites references to 31 different diseases and other stresses associated with the efe reaction  these include infections cardiomyopathies immunologic diseases congenital malformations even electrocution by lightning strike efe has two distinct genetic forms each having a different mode of inheritance an xlinked recessive form  and an autosomal recessive form  have both been observed an infant with dilated failing heart was no rarity on the pediatric wards of hospitals in the midtwentieth century when such patients came to the autopsy table most of the hearts showed the thickened endocardial layer noted above this was thought to be a disease affecting both the heart muscle and the endocardium and it was given various names such as idiopathic hypertrophy of the heart endocardial sclerosis cardiac enlargement of unknown cause etc some of these hearts also had overt congenital anomalies especially aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta the term endocardial fibroelastosis was introduced by weinberg and himmelfarb in 1943  in their pathology laboratory they noted that usually the endocardium was pearly white or opaque instead of normally thin and transparent and microscopically showed a systematic layering of collagenous and elastic fibers they felt their new term was more adequately descriptive and indeed it was quickly and widely adopted clinicians began applying it to any infant with a dilated failing heart in spite of the fact that the only way to definitively establish the presence of efe was to see it at autopsy efe had quickly become the name of a disease and it continues to be used by many physicians in this way though many patients with identical symptoms do not have the endocardial reaction of efe in the latter decades of the twentieth century new discoveries and new thinking about heart muscle disease gave rise to the term cardiomyopathy many of the cases of infantile cardiac failure were accordingly called primary cardiomyopathy as well as primary efe while those with identifiable congenital anomalies stressing the heart were called secondary efe in 1957 blackschaffer proposed a unitary explanation that stress on the ventricle of any kind may trigger the endocardial reaction so that all efe could be thought of as secondary  this prescient paper convinced few readers at the time evidence gradually accumulated as to the role of infection as one such type of stress the studies of fruhling and colleagues in 1962 were critical  they followed a series of epidemics of coxsackie virus infection in their part of france after each epidemic there were increased numbers of cases with efe coming to autopsy on closer study there were cases of pure acute myocarditis cases of mixed myocarditis and efe and cases where myocarditis had healed leaving just efe they were able to culture coxsackie virus from the tissues of many of the cases at all stages of this apparent progression a similar progression from myocarditis to efe was later observed at johns hopkins but no virology was done  noren and colleagues at university of minnesota acting on an idea floated at a pediatric meeting were able to show a relation between exposure to maternal mumps in fetal life efe and a positive skin test for mumps in infants  this brought on a large ongoing controversy and finally prompted a virologist colleague of theirs to inject embryonated eggs with mumps virus  the chicks at first showed the changes of myocarditis about a year later typical efe and transitional changes in between despite this the controversy about the role of mumps continued as the actual incidence of efe plummeted the proponents of mumps etiology pointed to this as the effect of the recent implementation of widespread mumps immunization evidence that viral infection may play a role as a cause or trigger of efe was greatly reinforced by the study directed by towbin in the virus laboratory of texas childrens hospital  they applied the methods of todays genetics to old preserved specimens from autopsies of patients with efe done well before mumps immunization began and found mumps genome in the tissues of over 80 of these patients it seems undeniable that transplacental mumps infection had been in the past the major cause of efe and that immunization was indeed the cause of efe having become rare noninfectious causes of efe have also been studied spurred by the opening of new avenues of genetics research now there are specific named genes associated with certain cardiomyopathies some of which show the characteristic reaction of efe a typical example is barth syndrome and the responsible gene tafazzin  developments in echocardiography both the technology of the machines and the skill of the operators have made it no longer necessary to see the endocardium at autopsy efe can now be found noninvasively by the recording of increased endocardial echos fetal echocardiography has shown that efe can begin to accumulate as early as 14 weeks of gestation and increase with incredible rapidity  and even that it can be reversed if the stress can be removed early in fetal life  the north american pediatric cardiomyopathy registry was founded in 2000 and has been supported since by the national heart lung and blood institute because of the logic of the diagnostic tree where efe applies to many branches of the tree and thus cannot occupy a branch it is not listed by the registry as a cause but rather with efe is a modifier that can be applied to any cause  thus the past half century has seen efe evolve from a mysterious but frequently observed disease to a rare but much better understood reaction to many diseases and other stresses the cause should be identified and where possible the treatment should be directed to that cause a last resort form of treatment is heart transplant

V phenytoin sold under the brand name dilantin among others is an antiseizure medication it is useful for the prevention of tonicclonic seizures partial seizures but not absence seizures the intravenous form is used for status epilepticus that does not improve with benzodiazepines it may also be used for certain heart arrhythmias or neuropathic pain it can be taken intravenously or by mouth  the intravenous form generally begins working within 30 minutes and is effective for 24 hours  blood levels can be measured to determine the proper dose  common side effects include nausea stomach pain loss of appetite poor coordination increased hair growth and enlargement of the gums potentially serious side effects include sleepiness self harm liver problems bone marrow suppression low blood pressure and toxic epidermal necrolysis there is evidence that use during pregnancy results in abnormalities in the baby it appears to be okay during breastfeeding alcohol may interfere with the medications effects  phenytoin was first made in 1908 and found useful in seizures in 1936  it is on the world health organizations list of essential medicines the most important medications needed in a basic health system  phenytoin is available as a generic medication and usually not too expensive  wholesale it costs between 0003 and 015 usd per dose  a month of treatment is about 30 usd in the united states    information in this section adapted from lexicomp  common side effects include nausea stomach pain loss of appetite poor coordination increased hair growth and enlargement of the gums potentially serious side effects include sleepiness self harm liver problems bone marrow suppression low blood pressure and toxic epidermal necrolysis there is evidence that use during pregnancy results in abnormalities in the baby it appears to be okay during breastfeeding alcohol may interfere with the medications effects  severe low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms can be seen with rapid infusion of iv phenytoin iv infusion should not exceed 50mgmin in adults or 13mgkgmin or 50mgmin whichever is slower in children heart monitoring should occur during and after iv infusion due to these risks oral phenytoin should be used if possible  at therapeutic doses phenytoin may produce nystagmus on lateral gaze at toxic doses patients experience vertical nystagmus double vision sedation slurred speech cerebellar ataxia and tremor  if phenytoin is stopped abruptly this may result in increased seizure frequency including status epilepticus  phenytoin may accumulate in the cerebral cortex over long periods of time which can cause atrophy of the cerebellum the degree of atrophy is related to the duration of phenytoin treatment and is not related to dosage of the medication  abrupt discontinuation of phenytoin can precipitate status epilepticus  it has been suggested that phenytoin causes a reduction in folic acid levels predisposing patients to megaloblastic anemia folate is presented in foods as polyglutamate which is then converted into monoglutamates by intestinal conjugase phenytoin acts by inhibiting this enzyme thereby causing folate deficiency  other side effects may include agranulocytosis aplastic anemia decreased white blood cell count  and a low platelet count  phenytoin is a known teratogen the syndrome consists of craniofacial anomalies broad nasal bridge cleft lip and palate smaller than normal head and a mild form of mental retardation average iq71  this syndrome resembles the welldescribed fetal alcohol syndrome  and has also been called the fetal hydantoin syndrome some recommend avoiding polytherapy and maintaining the minimal dose possible during pregnancy but acknowledge that current data do not provide clear answers  data now being collected by the epilepsy and antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry may one day answer this question definitively there is no good evidence that phenytoin is a human carcinogen   phenytoin has been associated with druginduced gingival enlargement overgrowth of the gums probably due to abovementioned folate deficiency indeed evidence from a randomized controlled trial suggests that folic acid supplementation can prevent gingival enlargement in children who take phenytoin  plasma concentrations needed to induce gingival lesions have not been clearly defined effects consist of the following bleeding upon probing increased gingival exudate pronounced gingival inflammatory response to plaque levels associated in some instances with bone loss but without tooth detachment hypertrichosis stevensjohnson syndrome purple glove syndrome rash exfoliative dermatitis itching excessive hairiness and coarsening of facial features can be seen in those taking phentyoin phenytoin therapy has been linked to the lifethreatening skin reactions stevensjohnson syndrome sjs and toxic epidermal necrolysis ten these conditions are significantly more common in patients with a particular hlab allele hlab1502  this allele occurs almost exclusively in patients with ancestry across broad areas of asia including south asian indians phenytoin is primarily metabolized to its inactive form by the enzyme cyp2c9 variations within the cyp2c9 gene that result in decreased enzymatic activity have been associated with increased phenytoin concentrations as well as reports of drug toxicities due to these increased concentrations  the us food and drug administration fda notes on the phenytoin drug label that since strong evidence exists linking hlab1502 with the risk of developing sjs or ten in patients taking carbamazepine consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients carrying this allele  phenytoin has been known to cause druginduced lupus  phenytoin is also associated with induction of reversible iga deficiency  phenytoin may increase risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior people on phenytoin should be monitored for any changes in mood the development or worsening depression andor any thoughts or behavior of suicide  chronic phenytoin use has been associated with decreased bone density and increased bone fractures phenytoin induces metabolizing enzymes in the liver this leads to increased metabolism of vitamin d thus decreased vitamin d levels vitamin d deficiency as well as low calcium and phospate in the blood cause decreased bone mineral density  phenytoin is an inducer of the cyp3a4 and cyp2c19 families of the p450 enzyme responsible for the livers degradation of various drugs  a 1981 study by the national institutes of health showed that antacids administered concomitantly with phenytoin altered not only the extent of absorption but also appeared to alter the rate of absorption antacids administered in a peptic ulcer regimen may decrease the auc of a single dose of phenytoin patients should be cautioned against concomitant use of antacids and phenytoin  warfarin coumadin and trimethoprim increase serum phenytoin levels and prolong the serum halflife of phenytoin by inhibiting its metabolism consider using other options if possible  phenytoin is believed to protect against seizures by causing voltagedependent block of voltage gated sodium channels  this blocks sustained high frequency repetitive firing of action potentials this is accomplished by reducing the amplitude of sodiumdependent action potentials through enhancing steady state inactivation sodium channels exist in three main conformations the resting state the open state and the inactive state phenytoin binds preferentially to the inactive form of the sodium channel because it takes time for the bound drug to dissociate from the inactive channel there is a time dependent block of the channel since the fraction of inactive channels is increased by membrane depolarization as well as by repetitive firing the binding to the inactive state by phenytoin sodium can produce voltagedependent usedependent and timedependent block of sodiumdependent action potentials  the primary site of action appears to be the motor cortex where spread of seizure activity is inhibited  possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient this includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses which prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas phenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of generalized tonicclonic seizures  phenytoin elimination kinetics show mixedorder behaviour at therapeutic concentrations a small increase in dose may lead to a large increase in drug concentration as elimination becomes saturated the time to reach steady state is often longer than 2 weeks     phenytoin diphenylhydantoin was first synthesized by german chemist heinrich biltz in 1908  biltz sold his discovery to parkedavis which did not find an immediate use for it in 1938 outside scientists including h houston merritt and tracy putnam discovered phenytoins usefulness for controlling seizures without the sedative effects associated with phenobarbital according to goodman and gilmans pharmacological basis of therapeutics it was approved by the usa food and drug administration in 1953 for use in seizures jack dreyfus founder of the dreyfus fund became a major proponent of phenytoin as a means to control nervousness and depression when he received a prescription for dilantin in 1966 he is believed to have supplied large amounts of the drug to richard nixon throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s dreyfus experience with phenytoin is outlined in his book a remarkable medicine has been overlooked  despite more than 70 million in personal financing his push to see phenytoin evaluated for alternative uses has had little lasting effect on the medical community this was partially because parkedavis was reluctant to invest in a drug nearing the end of its patent life and partially due to mixed results from various studies in 2008 the drug was put on the fdas potential signals of serious risks list to be further evaluated for approval the list identifies medications that the fda has identified a potential safety issue but does not mean that fda has identified a causal relationship between the drug and the listed risk to address this concern the warnings and precautions section of the labeling for dilantin injection was updated to include additional information about purple glove syndrome in november 2011  phenytoin is available as a generic medication and usually not too expensive  wholesale it costs between 0003 and 015 usd per dose  a month of treatment is about 30 usd in the united states  since september 2012 the marketing licence in the uk has been held by flynn pharma ltd

V the sarah murnaghan lung transplant controversy began in late may 2013 when the parents of a tenyearold philadelphia area girl with cystic fibrosis sarah murnaghan launched a campaign to change the under12 policy of the united network for organ sharing unos which they asserted was age discrimination her plight received considerable media attention particularly because kathleen sebelius secretary of health and human services refused to intervene to grant an exception to the rule    the system organizing lung transplants in the united states was overhauled in 2004 and again in 2008 the system gives those over the age of twelve a lung allocation score which is used to prioritize patients for transplant based partially on the urgency of their need however children under twelve are granted lungs on a firstcome firstserved basis  in addition there are far fewer donor lungs available for children under the age of twelve than there are for adults  between 10 and 20 as opposed to 1700 in a given year  sarah murnaghans parents argued that she needed a lung transplant or else she would die in a matter of weeks but that this was not possible because existing rules give higher priority for adult donor lungs to children who are at least twelve years old specifically her parents argued that she only had a few weeks to live but under current unos transplant policy did not qualify for adult donor lungs even though it is now possible to downsize adult lungs for transplantation into children kathleen sebelius refused to grant an exception to the rule in response to sebeliuss argument that a review of the policies would need to take place before the rule can be changed tom price argued that such a process would take an entire year to complete and that the girl would be dead by that time at the time of her transplant in june 2013 murnaghan had been waiting on the transplant list for about eighteen months  because of the side effects of antibiotics she had to take to treat her cystic fibrosis murnaghan developed permanent hearing loss   she also has osteoporosis and cystic fibrosisrelated diabetes    while the family portrayed their daughters case as one of bureaucracy getting in the way of lung transplantation that should have been and later was awarded based on her extreme necessity and limited time left to live should she not obtain the transplant some bioethicists questioned this depiction for example arthur caplan said in general the road to a transplant is still to let the system decide who will do best with scarce lifesaving organs  in addition he explained the reason children do not get put on the adult lung transplant list the reason kids get lower priority for lungs is that adult lungs rarely fit so you have to use only a part of one using only a lobe from an adult cadaver donor negatively impacts the chance of survival  similarly stuart sweet of the lung transplant program at st louis childrens hospital contended the issue here is really about how we designed this system to try to make it fair for everyone waiting for lungs there are ways of working through this that dont involve breaking the rules  this controversy came to a head on july 24 2013 when a perspective piece was published in the the new england journal of medicine regarding the debate over under12 allocation rules the piece written by karen ladin and douglas hanto noted that as a treatment for cystic fibrosis the most common diagnosis among pediatric candidates for lung transplants transplantation has been shown in several retrospective studies to have only marginal benefit although some data suggest otherwise however they also pointed out that a valid argument exists for those who wish to change the rules specifically younger patients who meet the size requirements and could benefit from adult lungs should be considered eligible  a study published in the chest noted that high lung allocation score above 75 is associated with increased morbidity and mortality following transplantation  murnaghan had an las score of 91 out of 100 upon her first transplant  her second las score was 87 out of 100  an article posted in the american journal of transplantation authored by dr sweet and dr barr in december 2013 discussed points brought up by the murnaghan family first they stated indeed the pool of adult transplant candidates is more than 50 times larger than the number of pediatric candidates so the actual number of lungs recovered from donors under 12 reflects both donor availability and candidate demand in fact roughly 5 of the 400 donors each year under 12 provide lungs compared to more than 35 of the 400 adolescent donors figure 1 it is unlikely that donor characteristics are solely responsible for the lower percentage thus one area of focus for the pediatric lung transplant community should be to explore tapping into this apparent opportunity they also stated the second concept propagated by this story is that lobar transplant from adult donors is the best solution to the perceived lack of lung donors for children under 12 although this option may be appropriate for children in circumstances where experienced transplant surgeons and physicians counsel the family that waiting for suitably sized donor organs from a pediatric donor is not feasible the reality is that there are limited data supporting this approach for young children in the most widely referenced series the youngest recipient of an adult deceased donor lobar transplant was 9 years old 3 moreover the authors experience with living donor lobar transplant suggests that size matching is critical to successful outcome thus a change to the allocation system that encourages increased use of lobar transplant for young children would be premature  on june 5 2013 judge michael baylson of the eastern district of pennsylvania district court directed kathleen sebelius to temporarily suspend the under12 rule following an emergency hearing judge baylson stated in a memo regarding the issue of the temporary restraining order the court concluded that issuance of the tro was very much in the interest of the public as well as the plaintiffs and sarah he also stated finally this court did not in any way shape or form dictate when or whether murnaghan should receive a lung transplant  organ procurement and transplantation network optn responded by making a temporary oneyear appeals process for children under the age of 12 whose doctors feel may benefit from adult lungs this temporary appeals process expired on june 30 2014  on june 12 2013 murnaghan underwent what would be the first of two double lung transplants she received these lungs from an adult donor in a statement immediately following the surgery her family said the surgeons had no challenges resizing and transplanting the donor lungs  the surgery went smoothly and sarah did extremely well  this first pair of lungs however failed within hours of completion of the operation necessitating the transplantation of a second pair of adult lungs on june 15 2013 murnaghan was placed on an ecmo machine on june 12 2013 until her second transplant on june 15 2013 according to the associated press the second set of lungs were infected with pneumonia but the girls condition was too dire to wait for another set of lungs to become available surgeons were able to remove the infected portion before the transplant after the transplant murnaghan was able to take a few breaths on her own after doctors removed her breathing tube  however she quickly needed breathing assistance and the tube was reinserted it was later discovered that her diaphragm had become paralyzed  after her second transplant murnaghan developed pneumonia in her right lung  abc news reported that a healthier patient might have turned down the lungs and waited for a better pair but sarah was out of options so they went ahead with the operation  sarah also needed a diaphragm plication folding and suturing to tighten the diaphragm and a nissen fundoplication  on august 27 2013 murnaghan returned home from childrens hospital of philadelphia where she had been staying since february 19  she is still undergoing physical therapy at home as part of her recovery and continues to struggle with compression fractures in her spine however according to her mother murnaghan is able to breathe off the ventilator for twelve hours a day

V cystic fibrosis cf also known as mucoviscidosis is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs but also the pancreas liver kidneys and intestine   longterm issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections other signs and symptoms include sinus infections poor growth fatty stool clubbing of the fingers and toes and infertility in males among others different people may have different degrees of symptoms  cf is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner it is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr protein  those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly normal  cftr is involved in production of sweat digestive fluids and mucus  when cftr is not functional secretions which are usually thin instead become thick  the condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing  screening of infants at birth takes place in some areas of the world  there is no cure for cystic fibrosis  lung infections are treated with antibiotics which may be given intravenously inhaled or by mouth sometimes the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term inhaled hypertonic saline and salbutamol may also be useful lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen pancreatic enzyme replacement and fatsoluble vitamin supplementation are important especially in the young while not well supported by evidence many people use airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy  the average life expectancy is between 42 and 50 years in the developed world   lung problems are responsible for death in 80 of people with cystic fibrosis  cf is most common among people of northern european ancestry and affects about one out of every 3000 newborns  about one in 25 people are carriers  it is least common in africans and asians  it was first recognized as a specific disease by dorothy andersen in 1938 with descriptions that fit the condition occurring at least as far back as 1595  the name cystic fibrosis refers to the characteristic fibrosis and cysts that form within the pancreas     the main signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis are saltytasting skin  poor growth and poor weight gain despite normal food intake  accumulation of thick sticky mucus  frequent chest infections and coughing or shortness of breath  males can be infertile due to congenital absence of the vas deferens  symptoms often appear in infancy and childhood such as bowel obstruction due to meconium ileus in newborn babies  as the children grow they must exercise to release mucus in the alveoli  ciliated epithelial cells in the person have a mutated protein that leads to abnormally viscous mucus production  the poor growth in children typically presents as an inability to gain weight or height at the same rate as their peers and is occasionally not diagnosed until investigation is initiated for poor growth the causes of growth failure are multifactorial and include chronic lung infection poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract and increased metabolic demand due to chronic illness  in rare cases cystic fibrosis can manifest itself as a coagulation disorder vitamin k is normally absorbed from breast milk formula and later solid foods this absorption is impaired in some cystic fibrosis patients young children are especially sensitive to vitamin k malabsorptive disorders because only a very small amount of vitamin k crosses the placenta leaving the child with very low reserves and limited ability to absorb vitamin k from dietary sources after birth because factors ii vii ix and x clotting factors are vitamin kdependent low levels of vitamin k can result in coagulation problems consequently when a child presents with unexplained bruising a coagulation evaluation may be warranted to determine whether there is an underlying disease  lung disease results from clogging of the airways due to mucus buildup decreased mucociliary clearance and resulting inflammation   inflammation and infection cause injury and structural changes to the lungs leading to a variety of symptoms in the early stages incessant coughing copious phlegm production and decreased ability to exercise are common many of these symptoms occur when bacteria that normally inhabit the thick mucus grow out of control and cause pneumonia in later stages changes in the architecture of the lung such as pathology in the major airways bronchiectasis further exacerbate difficulties in breathing other signs include coughing up blood hemoptysis high blood pressure in the lung pulmonary hypertension heart failure difficulties getting enough oxygen to the body hypoxia and respiratory failure requiring support with breathing masks such as bilevel positive airway pressure machines or ventilators  staphylococcus aureus haemophilus influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the three most common organisms causing lung infections in cf patients  in addition to typical bacterial infections people with cf more commonly develop other types of lung disease among these is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in which the bodys response to the common fungus aspergillus fumigatus causes worsening of breathing problems another is infection with mycobacterium avium complex mac a group of bacteria related to tuberculosis which can cause a lot of lung damage and does not respond to common antibiotics  mucus in the paranasal sinuses is equally thick and may also cause blockage of the sinus passages leading to infection this may cause facial pain fever nasal drainage and headaches individuals with cf may develop overgrowth of the nasal tissue nasal polyps due to inflammation from chronic sinus infections  recurrent sinonasal polyps can occur in as many as 10 to 25 of cf patients  these polyps can block the nasal passages and increase breathing difficulties   cardiorespiratory complications are the most common cause of death 80 in patients at most cf centers in the united states  prior to prenatal and newborn screening cystic fibrosis was often diagnosed when a newborn infant failed to pass feces meconium meconium may completely block the intestines and cause serious illness this condition called meconium ileus occurs in 510   of newborns with cf in addition protrusion of internal rectal membranes rectal prolapse is more common occurring in as many as 10 of children with cf  and it is caused by increased fecal volume malnutrition and increased intraabdominal pressure due to coughing  the thick mucus seen in the lungs has a counterpart in thickened secretions from the pancreas an organ responsible for providing digestive juices that help break down food these secretions block the exocrine movement of the digestive enzymes into the duodenum and result in irreversible damage to the pancreas often with painful inflammation pancreatitis  the pancreatic ducts are totally plugged in more advanced cases usually seen in older children or adolescents  this causes atrophy of the exocrine glands and progressive fibrosis  the lack of digestive enzymes leads to difficulty absorbing nutrients with their subsequent excretion in the feces a disorder known as malabsorption malabsorption leads to malnutrition and poor growth and development because of calorie loss resultant hypoproteinemia may be severe enough to cause generalized edema  individuals with cf also have difficulties absorbing the fatsoluble vitamins a d e and k in addition to the pancreas problems people with cystic fibrosis experience more heartburn intestinal blockage by intussusception and constipation  older individuals with cf may develop distal intestinal obstruction syndrome when thickened feces cause intestinal blockage  exocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurs in the majority 85 to 90 of patients with cf  it is mainly associated with severe cftr mutations where both alleles are completely nonfunctional eg \u03b4f508\u03b4f508  it occurs in 10 to 15 of patients with one severe and one mild cftr mutation where there still is a little cftr activity or where there are two mild cftr mutations  in these milder cases there is still sufficient pancreatic exocrine function so that enzyme supplementation is not required  there are usually no other gi complications in pancreassufficient phenotypes and in general such individuals usually have excellent growth and development  despite this idiopathic chronic pancreatitis can occur in a subset of pancreassufficient individuals with cf and is associated with recurrent abdominal pain and lifethreatening complications  thickened secretions also may cause liver problems in patients with cf bile secreted by the liver to aid in digestion may block the bile ducts leading to liver damage over time this can lead to scarring and nodularity cirrhosis the liver fails to rid the blood of toxins and does not make important proteins such as those responsible for blood clotting   liver disease is the third most common cause of death associated with cf  the pancreas contains the islets of langerhans which are responsible for making insulin a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose damage of the pancreas can lead to loss of the islet cells leading to a type of diabetes that is unique to those with the disease  this cystic fibrosisrelated diabetes cfrd shares characteristics that can be found in type 1 and type 2 diabetics and is one of the principal nonpulmonary complications of cf  vitamin d is involved in calcium and phosphate regulation poor uptake of vitamin d from the diet because of malabsorption can lead to the bone disease osteoporosis in which weakened bones are more susceptible to fractures  in addition people with cf often develop clubbing of their fingers and toes due to the effects of chronic illness and low oxygen in their tissues   infertility affects both men and women at least 97 of men with cystic fibrosis are infertile but not sterile and can have children with assisted reproductive techniques  the main cause of infertility in men with cystic fibrosis is congenital absence of the vas deferens which normally connects the testes to the ejaculatory ducts of the penis but potentially also by other mechanisms such as causing no sperm teratospermia and few sperm with poor motility  many men found to have congenital absence of the vas deferens during evaluation for infertility have a mild previously undiagnosed form of cf  approximately 20 of women with cf have fertility difficulties due to thickened cervical mucus or malnutrition in severe cases malnutrition disrupts ovulation and causes amenorrhea  cf is caused by a mutation in the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr the most common mutation \u03b4f508 is a deletion \u03b4 signifying deletion of three nucleotides  that results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine f at the 508th position on the protein this mutation accounts for twothirds 6670  of cf cases worldwide and 90 of cases in the united states however there are over 1500 other mutations that can produce cf  although most people have two working copies alleles of the cftr gene only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis cf develops when neither allele can produce a functional cftr protein thus cf is considered an autosomal recessive disease the cftr gene found at the q312 locus of chromosome 7 is 230000 base pairs long and creates a protein that is 1480 amino acids long more specifically the location is between base pair 117120016 to 117308718 on the long arm of chromosome 7 region 3 band 1 subband 2 represented as 7q312 structurally cftr is a type of gene known as an abc gene the product of this gene the cftr is a chloride ion channel important in creating sweat digestive juices and mucus this protein possesses two atphydrolyzing domains which allows the protein to use energy in the form of atp it also contains two domains comprising 6 alpha helices apiece which allow the protein to cross the cell membrane a regulatory binding site on the protein allows activation by phosphorylation mainly by campdependent protein kinase  the carboxyl terminal of the protein is anchored to the cytoskeleton by a pdz domain interaction  in addition there is increasing evidence that genetic modifiers besides cftr modulate the frequency and severity of the disease one example is mannanbinding lectin which is involved in innate immunity by facilitating phagocytosis of microorganisms polymorphisms in one or both mannanbinding lectin alleles that result in lower circulating levels of the protein are associated with a threefold higher risk of endstage lung disease as well as an increased burden of chronic bacterial infections  there are several mutations in the cftr gene and different mutations cause different defects in the cftr protein sometimes causing a milder or more severe disease these protein defects are also targets for drugs which can sometimes restore their function \u03b4f508cftr which occurs in 90 of patients in the us creates a protein that does not fold normally and is degraded by the cell other mutations result in proteins that are too short truncated because production is ended prematurely other mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally do not allow chloride iodide and thiocyanate to cross the membrane appropriately  degrade at a faster rate than normal mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the cftr protein being produced  the protein created by this gene is anchored to the outer membrane of cells in the sweat glands lungs pancreas and all other remaining exocrine glands in the body the protein spans this membrane and acts as a channel connecting the inner part of the cell cytoplasm to the surrounding fluid this channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of halogens from inside to outside of the cell however in the sweat ducts it facilitates the movement of chloride from the sweat duct into the cytoplasm when the cftr protein does not resorb ions in sweat ducts chloride and thiocyanate  released from sweat glands are trapped inside the ducts and pumped to the skin additionally hypothiocyanite oscn cannot be produced by the immune defense system   because chloride is negatively charged this creates a difference in the electrical potential inside and outside the cell causing cations to cross into the cell sodium is the most common cation in the extracellular space the excess chloride within sweat ducts prevents sodium resorption by epithelial sodium channels and the combination of sodium and chloride creates the salt which is lost in high amounts in the sweat of individuals with cf this lost salt forms the basis for the sweat test  most of the damage in cf is due to blockage of the narrow passages of affected organs with thickened secretions these blockages lead to remodeling and infection in the lung damage by accumulated digestive enzymes in the pancreas blockage of the intestines by thick faeces etc there are several theories on how the defects in the protein and cellular function cause the clinical effects the most current theory suggests that defective ion transport leads to dehydration in the airway epithelia thickening mucus in airway epithelial cells the cilia exist in between the cells apical surface and mucus in a layer known as airway surface liquid asl the flow of ions from the cell and into this layer is determined by ion channels like cftr cftr not only allows chloride ions to be drawn from the cell and into the asl but it also regulates another channel called enac enac allows sodium ions to leave the asl and enter the respiratory epithelium cftr normally inhibits this channel but if the cftr is defective then sodium will flow freely from the asl and into the cell as water follows sodium the depth of asl will be depleted and the cilia will be left in the mucous layer  as cilia cannot effectively move in a thick viscous environment there is deficient mucociliary clearance and a buildup of mucous clogging small airways  the accumulation of more viscous nutrientrich mucus in the lungs allows bacteria to hide from the bodys immune system causing repeated respiratory infections the presence of the same cftr proteins in pancreatic duct and skin cells are what cause symptoms in these systems the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis are colonized and infected by bacteria from an early age these bacteria which often spread among individuals with cf thrive in the altered mucus which collects in the small airways of the lungs this mucus leads to the formation of bacterial microenvironments known as biofilms that are difficult for immune cells and antibiotics to penetrate viscous secretions and persistent respiratory infections repeatedly damage the lung by gradually remodeling the airways which makes infection even more difficult to eradicate  over time both the types of bacteria and their individual characteristics change in individuals with cf in the initial stage common bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae colonize and infect the lungs  eventually pseudomonas aeruginosa and sometimes burkholderia cepacia dominates by 18 years of age 80 of patients with classic cf harbor p aeruginosa and 35 harbor b cepacia  once within the lungs these bacteria adapt to the environment and develop resistance to commonly used antibiotics pseudomonas can develop special characteristics that allow the formation of large colonies known as mucoid pseudomonas which are rarely seen in people that do not have cf  one way infection spreads is by passing between different individuals with cf  in the past people with cf often participated in summer cf camps and other recreational gatherings   hospitals grouped patients with cf into common areas and routine equipment such as nebulizers  was not sterilized between individual patients  this led to transmission of more dangerous strains of bacteria among groups of patients as a result individuals with cf are now routinely isolated from one another in the healthcare setting and healthcare providers are encouraged to wear gowns and gloves when examining patients with cf to limit the spread of virulent bacterial strains  cf patients may also have their airways chronically colonized by filamentous fungi such as aspergillus fumigatus scedosporium apiospermum aspergillus terreus andor yeasts such as candida albicans other filamentous fungi less commonly isolated include aspergillus flavus and aspergillus nidulans occur transiently in cf respiratory secretions and exophiala dermatitidis and scedosporium prolificans chronic airwaycolonizers some filamentous fungi like penicillium emersonii and acrophialophora fusispora are encountered in patients almost exclusively in the context of cf  defective mucociliary clearance characterizing cf is associated with local immunological disorders in addition the prolonged therapy with antibiotics and the use of corticosteroid treatments may also facilitate fungal growth although the clinical relevance of the fungal airway colonization is still a matter of debate filamentous fungi may contribute to the local inflammatory response and therefore to the progressive deterioration of the lung function as often happens with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis abpa  the most common fungal disease in the context of cf involving a th2driven immune response to aspergillus   cystic fibrosis may be diagnosed by many different methods including newborn screening sweat testing and genetic testing  as of 2006 in the united states 10 percent of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth as part of newborn screening programs the newborn screen initially measures for raised blood concentration of immunoreactive trypsinogen  infants with an abnormal newborn screen need a sweat test to confirm the cf diagnosis in many cases a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty  trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the cftr gene carriers or in rare instances in individuals with two normal copies of the cftr gene due to these false positives cf screening in newborns can be controversial   most states and countries do not screen for cf routinely at birth therefore most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms eg sinopulmonary disease and gi manifestations  prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis the most commonly used form of testing is the sweat test sweattesting involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating pilocarpine to deliver the medication through the skin iontophoresis is used to whereby one electrode is placed onto the applied medication and an electric current is passed to a separate electrode on the skin the resultant sweat is then collected on filter paper or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of sodium and chloride people with cf have increased amounts of sodium and chloride in their sweat in contrast people with cf have less thiocyanate and hypothiocyanite in their saliva  and mucus banfi et al cf can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the cftr gene  people with cf may be listed in a disease registry that allows researchers and doctors to track health results and identify candidates for clinical trials  couples who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy can have themselves tested for the cftr gene mutations to determine the risk that their child will be born with cystic fibrosis testing is typically performed first on one or both parents and if the risk of cf is high testing on the fetus is performed the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog recommends testing for couples who have a personal or close family history of cf and they recommend that carrier testing be offered to all caucasian couples and be made available to couples of other ethnic backgrounds  because development of cf in the fetus requires each parent to pass on a mutated copy of the cftr gene and because cf testing is expensive testing is often performed initially on one parent if testing shows that parent is a cftr gene mutation carrier the other parent is tested to calculate the risk that their children will have cf cf can result from more than a thousand different mutations and as of 2006 it is not possible to test for each one testing analyzes the blood for the most common mutations such as \u03b4f508most commercially available tests look for 32 or fewer different mutations if a family has a known uncommon mutation specific screening for that mutation can be performed because not all known mutations are found on current tests a negative screen does not guarantee that a child will not have cf  during pregnancy testing can be performed on the placenta chorionic villus sampling or the fluid around the fetus amniocentesis however chorionic villus sampling has a risk of fetal death of 1 in 100 and amniocentesis of 1 in 200  a recent study has indicated this may be much lower approximately 1 in 1600  economically for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis when comparing preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd with natural conception nc followed by prenatal testing and abortion of affected pregnancies pgd provides net economic benefits up to a maternal age of approximately 40 years after which nc prenatal testing and abortion has higher economic benefit  while there are no cures for cystic fibrosis there are several treatment methods the management of cystic fibrosis has improved significantly over the past 70 years while infants born with cystic fibrosis 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year infants today are likely to live well into adulthood recent advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis have meant that an individual with cystic fibrosis can live a fuller life less encumbered by their condition the cornerstones of management are proactive treatment of airway infection and encouragement of good nutrition and an active lifestyle pulmonary rehabilitation as a management of cystic fibrosis continues throughout a persons life and is aimed at maximizing organ function and therefore quality of life at best current treatments delay the decline in organ function because of the wide variation in disease symptoms treatment typically occurs at specialist multidisciplinary centers and is tailored to the individual targets for therapy are the lungs gastrointestinal tract including pancreatic enzyme supplements the reproductive organs including assisted reproductive technology art and psychological support  the most consistent aspect of therapy in cystic fibrosis is limiting and treating the lung damage caused by thick mucus and infection with the goal of maintaining quality of life intravenous inhaled and oral antibiotics are used to treat chronic and acute infections mechanical devices and inhalation medications are used to alter and clear the thickened mucus these therapies while effective can be extremely timeconsuming many people with cf are on one or more antibiotics at all times even when healthy to prophylactically suppress infection antibiotics are absolutely necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or there has been a noticeable decline in lung function and are usually chosen based on the results of a sputum analysis and the persons past response this prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent iv such as a peripherally inserted central catheter picc line or portacath inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as tobramycin colistin and aztreonam is often given for months at a time to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria    inhaled antibiotic therapy helps lung function by fighting infection but also has significant drawbacks like development of antibiotic resistance tinnitus and changes in the voice  oral antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or azithromycin are given to help prevent infection or to control ongoing infection  the aminoglycoside antibiotics eg tobramycin used can cause hearing loss damage to the balance system in the inner ear or kidney problems with longterm use  to prevent these sideeffects the amount of antibiotics in the blood is routinely measured and adjusted accordingly several mechanical techniques are used to dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration in the hospital setting chest physiotherapy cpt is utilized a respiratory therapist percusses an individuals chest with his or her hands several times a day to loosen up secretions devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the thairapy vest and the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator ipv newer methods such as biphasic cuirass ventilation and associated clearance mode available in such devices integrate a cough assistance phase as well as a vibration phase for dislodging secretions these are portable and adapted for home use  ivacaftor is an oral medication for the treatment of cystic fibrosis due to a number of specific mutations   it improves lung function by about 10 however as of 2014 is expensive  aerosolized medications that help loosen secretions include dornase alfa and hypertonic saline  dornase is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease which breaks down dna in the sputum thus decreasing its viscosity  denufosol is an investigational drug that opens an alternative chloride channel helping to liquefy mucus  it is unclear if inhaled corticosteroids are useful  as lung disease worsens mechanical breathing support may become necessary individuals with cf may need to wear special masks at night that help push air into their lungs these machines known as bilevel positive airway pressure bipap ventilators help prevent low blood oxygen levels during sleep bipap may also be used during physical therapy to improve sputum clearance  during severe illness a tube may be placed in the throat a procedure known as a tracheostomy to enable breathing supported by a ventilator for children preliminary studies show massage therapy may help people and their families quality of life  it is unclear what effect pneumococcal vaccination has as it has not been studied as of 2014  lung transplantation often becomes necessary for individuals with cystic fibrosis as lung function and exercise tolerance decline although single lung transplantation is possible in other diseases individuals with cf must have both lungs replaced because the remaining lung might contain bacteria that could infect the transplanted lung a pancreatic or liver transplant may be performed at the same time in order to alleviate liver disease andor diabetes  lung transplantation is considered when lung function declines to the point where assistance from mechanical devices is required or someones survival is threatened  newborns with intestinal obstruction typically require surgery whereas adults with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome typically do not treatment of pancreatic insufficiency by replacement of missing digestive enzymes allows the duodenum to properly absorb nutrients and vitamins that would otherwise be lost in the feces however the best dosage and form of pancreatic enzyme replacement is unclear as are the risks and longterm effectiveness of this treatment  so far no largescale research involving the incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in adults with cystic fibrosis has been conducted this is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of people with cystic fibrosis do not live long enough to develop clinically significant atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease diabetes is the most common nonpulmonary complication of cf it mixes features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is recognized as a distinct entity cystic fibrosisrelated diabetes cfrd   while oral antidiabetic drugs are sometimes used the only recommended treatment is the use of insulin injections or an insulin pump  and unlike in type 1 and 2 diabetes dietary restrictions are not recommended  development of osteoporosis can be prevented by increased intake of vitamin d and calcium and can be treated by bisphosphonates although adverse effects can be an issue  poor growth may be avoided by insertion of a feeding tube for increasing calories through supplemental feeds or by administration of injected growth hormone  sinus infections are treated by prolonged courses of antibiotics the development of nasal polyps or other chronic changes within the nasal passages may severely limit airflow through the nose and over time reduce the persons sense of smell sinus surgery is often used to alleviate nasal obstruction and to limit further infections nasal steroids such as fluticasone are used to decrease nasal inflammation  female infertility may be overcome by assisted reproduction technology particularly embryo transfer techniques male infertility caused by absence of the vas deferens may be overcome with testicular sperm extraction tese collecting sperm cells directly from the testicles if the collected sample contains too few sperm cells to likely have a spontaneous fertilization intracytoplasmic sperm injection can be performed  third party reproduction is also a possibility for women with cf it is unclear if taking antioxidants affects outcomes  the prognosis for cystic fibrosis has improved due to earlier diagnosis through screening better treatment and access to health care in 1959 the median age of survival of children with cystic fibrosis in the united states was six months  in 2010 survival is estimated to be 37 years for women and 40 for men  in canada median survival increased from 24 years in 1982 to 477 in 2007  of those with cystic fibrosis who are more than 18 years old as of 2009 92 had graduated from high school 67 had at least some college education 15 were disabled and 9 were unemployed 56 were single and 39 were married or living with a partner  chronic illnesses can be very difficult to manage cystic fibrosis cf is a chronic illness that affects the digestive and respiratory tracts resulting in generalized malnutrition and chronic respiratory infections  the thick secretions clog the airways in the lungs which often cause inflammation and severe lung infections   if it is compromised it affects the quality of life of someone with cf and their ability to complete such tasks as everyday chores it is important for cf patients to understand the detrimental relationship that chronic illnesses place on the quality of life according to schmitz and goldbeck 2006 the fact that cystic fibrosis significantly increases emotional stress on both the individual and the family and the necessary timeconsuming daily treatment routine may have further negative effects on quality of life qol  however havermans and colleagues 2006 have shown that young outpatients with cf who have participated in the cfqr cystic fibrosis questionnairerevised rated some qol domains higher than did their parents  consequently outpatients with cf have a more positive outlook for themselves furthermore there are many ways to improve the qol in cf patients exercise is promoted to increase lung function integrating an exercise regimen into the cf patients daily routine can significantly improve the quality of life  there is no definitive cure for cystic fibrosis however there are diverse medications used such as mucolytics bronchodilators steroids and antibiotics that have the purpose of loosening mucus expanding airways decreasing inflammation and fighting lung infections  cystic fibrosis is the most common lifelimiting autosomal recessive disease among people of european heritage  in the united states approximately 30000 individuals have cf most are diagnosed by six months of age in canada there are approximately 4000 people with cf  approximately 1 in 25 people of european descent and one in 30 of caucasian americans  is a carrier of a cystic fibrosis mutation although cf is less common in these groups approximately 1 in 46 hispanics 1 in 65 africans and 1 in 90 asians carry at least one abnormal cftr gene   ireland has the worlds highest prevalence of cystic fibrosis at 11353  although technically a rare disease cystic fibrosis is ranked as one of the most widespread lifeshortening genetic diseases it is most common among nations in the western world an exception is finland where only one in 80 people carry a cf mutation  the world health organization states that in the european union 1 in 20003000 newborns is found to be affected by cf  in the united states 1 in 3500 children are born with cf  in 1997 about 1 in 3300 caucasian children in the united states was born with cystic fibrosis in contrast only 1 in 15000 african american children suffered from cystic fibrosis and in asian americans the rate was even lower at 1 in 32000  cystic fibrosis is diagnosed in males and females equally for reasons that remain unclear data has shown that males tend to have a longer life expectancy than females   however recent studies suggest this gender gap may no longer exist perhaps due to improvements in health care facilities   while a recent study from ireland identified a link between the female hormone estrogen and worse outcomes in cf  the distribution of cf alleles varies among populations the frequency of \u03b4f508 carriers has been estimated at 1200 in northern sweden 1143 in lithuanians and 138 in denmark no \u03b4f508 carriers were found among 171 finns and 151 saami people  \u03b4f508 does occur in finland but it is a minority allele there cystic fibrosis is known to occur in only 20 families pedigrees in finland  the \u03b4f508 mutation is estimated to be up to 52000 years old  numerous hypotheses have been advanced as to why such a lethal mutation has persisted and spread in the human population other common autosomal recessive diseases such as sicklecell anemia have been found to protect carriers from other diseases a concept known as heterozygote advantage resistance to the following have all been proposed as possible sources of heterozygote advantage it is supposed that cf appeared about 3000 bc because of migration of peoples gene mutations and new conditions in nourishment  although the entire clinical spectrum of cf was not recognized until the 1930s certain aspects of cf were identified much earlier indeed literature from germany and switzerland in the 18th century warned wehe dem kind das beim kuß auf die stirn salzig schmekt er ist verhext und muss bald sterbe or woe to the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow for he is cursed and soon must die recognizing the association between the salt loss in cf and illness  in the 19th century carl von rokitansky described a case of fetal death with meconium peritonitis a complication of meconium ileus associated with cystic fibrosis meconium ileus was first described in 1905 by karl landsteiner  in 1936 guido fanconi published a paper describing a connection between celiac disease cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and bronchiectasis  in 1938 dorothy hansine andersen published an article cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and its relation to celiac disease a clinical and pathological study in the american journal of diseases of children she was the first to describe the characteristic cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and to correlate it with the lung and intestinal disease prominent in cf  she also first hypothesized that cf was a recessive disease and first used pancreatic enzyme replacement to treat affected children in 1952 paul di santagnese discovered abnormalities in sweat electrolytes a sweat test was developed and improved over the next decade  the first linkage between cf and another marker paroxonase was found in 1985 by hans eiberg indicating that only one locus exists for cf in 1988 the first mutation for cf \u03b4f508 was discovered by francis collins lapchee tsui and john r riordan on the seventh chromosome subsequent research has found over 1000 different mutations that cause cf because mutations in the cftr gene are typically small classical genetics techniques had been unable to accurately pinpoint the mutated gene  using protein markers genelinkage studies were able to map the mutation to chromosome 7 chromosomewalking and jumping techniques were then used to identify and sequence the gene  in 1989 lapchee tsui led a team of researchers at the hospital for sick children in toronto that discovered the gene responsible for cf cystic fibrosis represents a classic example of how a human genetic disorder was elucidated strictly by the process of forward genetics gene therapy has been explored as a potential cure for cystic fibrosis results from trials have shown limited success as of 2013  a small study published in 2015 found a small benefit  the focus of much cystic fibrosis gene therapy research is aimed at trying to place a normal copy of the cftr gene into affected cells transferring the normal cftr gene into the affected epithelium cells would result in the production of functional cftr in all target cells without adverse reactions or an inflammation response studies have shown that to prevent the lung manifestations of cystic fibrosis only 510 the normal amount of cftr gene expression is needed  multiple approaches have been tested for gene transfer such as liposomes and viral vectors in animal models and clinical trials however both methods were found to be relatively inefficient treatment options  the main reason is that very few cells take up the vector and express the gene so the treatment has little effect additionally problems have been noted in cdna recombination such that the gene introduced by the treatment is rendered unusable  there has been a functional repair in culture of cftr by crisprcas9 in intestinal stem cell organoids of cystic fibrosis patients  a number of small molecules that aim at compensating various mutations of the cftr gene are under development one approach is to develop drugs that get the ribosome to overcome the stop codon and synthesize a fulllength cftr protein about 10 of cf result from a premature stop codon in the dna leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins these drugs target nonsense mutations such as g542x which consists of the amino acid glycine in position 542 being replaced by a stop codon aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis and errorcorrection in some cases they can cause the cell to overcome a premature stop codon by inserting a random amino acid thereby allowing expression of a fulllength protein  the aminoglycoside gentamicin has been used to treat lung cells from cf patients in the laboratory to induce the cells to grow fulllength proteins  another drug targeting nonsense mutations is ataluren which is undergoing phase iii clinical trials as of october 2011   it is unclear as of 2014 if ursodeoxycholic acid is useful for those with cystic fibrosisrelated liver disease

V a hernia is the exit of an organ such as the bowel through the wall of the cavity in which it normally resides  hernias come in a number of different types most commonly they involve the abdomen specifically the groin  groin hernias are most common of the inguinal type but may also be femoral  other hernias include hiatus incisional and umbilical hernias  for groin hernias symptoms are present in about 66 of people this may include pain or discomfort especially with coughing exercise or going to the toilet often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down a bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down groin hernias occur more often on the right than left side the main concern is strangulation where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked this usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area  hiatus or hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating  risk factors for the development of a hernia include smoking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease obesity pregnancy peritoneal dialysis collagen vascular disease and previous open appendectomy among others    hernias are partly genetic and occur more often in certain families it is unclear if groin hernias are associated with heavy lifting hernias can often be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms occasionally medical imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other possible causes  the diagnosis of hiatus hernias is often by endoscopy  groin hernias that do not cause symptoms in males do not need to be repaired repair however is generally recommended in women due to the higher rate of femoral hernias which have more complications if strangulation occurs immediate surgery is required repair may be done by open surgery or by laparoscopic surgery open surgery has the benefit of possibly being done under local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia laparoscopic surgery generally has less pain following the procedure  a hiatus hernia may be treated with lifestyle changes such as raising the head of the bed weight loss and adjusting eating habits the medications h2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may help if the symptoms do not improve with medications the surgery known as laparoscopic fundoplication may be an option  about 27 of males and 3 of females develop a groin hernia at some time in their life  groin hernias occur most often before the age of one and after the age of fifty  inguinal femoral and abdominal hernias resulted in 51000 deaths in 2013 and 55000 in 1990  it is not known how commonly hiatus hernias occur with estimates in north america varying from 10 to 80  the first known description of a hernia dates back to at least 1550 bc in the ebers papyrus from egypt    by far the most common hernias develop in the abdomen when a weakness in the abdominal wall evolves into a localized hole or defect through which adipose tissue or abdominal organs covered with peritoneum may protrude another common hernia involves the spinal discs and causes sciatica a hiatus hernia occurs when the stomach protrudes into the mediastinum through the esophageal opening in the diaphragm hernias may or may not present with either pain at the site a visible or palpable lump or in some cases more vague symptoms resulting from pressure on an organ which has become stuck in the hernia sometimes leading to organ dysfunction fatty tissue usually enters a hernia first but it may be followed or accompanied by an organ hernias are caused by a disruption or opening in the fascia or fibrous tissue which forms the abdominal wall it is possible for the bulge associated with a hernia to come and go but the defect in the tissue will persist symptoms and signs vary depending on the type of hernia symptoms may or may not be present in some inguinal hernias in the case of reducible hernias a bulge in the groin or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt when standing such a bulge becomes more obvious besides the bulge other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation and in men there is sometimes pain and swelling in the scrotum around the testicular area  irreducible abdominal hernias or incarcerated hernias may be painful but their most relevant symptom is that they cannot return to the abdominal cavity when pushed in they may be chronic although painless and can lead to strangulation loss of blood supply andor obstruction kinking of intestine strangulated hernias are always painful and pain is followed by tenderness nausea vomiting or fever may occur in these cases due to bowel obstruction also the hernia bulge in this case may turn red purple or dark and pink in the diagnosis of abdominal hernias imaging is the principal means of detecting internal diaphragmatic and other nonpalpable or unsuspected hernias multidetector ct mdct can show with precision the anatomic site of the hernia sac the contents of the sac and any complications mdct also offers clear detail of the abdominal wall allowing wall hernias to be identified accurately  causes of hiatus hernia vary depending on each individual among the multiple causes however are the mechanical causes which include improper heavy weight lifting hard coughing bouts sharp blows to the abdomen and incorrect posture  furthermore conditions that increase the pressure of the abdominal cavity may also cause hernias or worsen the existing ones some examples would be obesity straining during a bowel movement or urination constipation enlarged prostate chronic lung disease and also fluid in the abdominal cavity ascites  also if muscles are weakened due to poor nutrition smoking and overexertion hernias are more likely to occur the physiological school of thought contends that in the case of inguinal hernia the abovementioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying physiological cause they contend that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch  abdominal wall hernia may occur due to trauma if this type of hernia is due to blunt trauma it is an emergency condition and could be associated with various solid organs and hollow viscus injuries by far the most common hernias up to 75 of all abdominal hernias are the socalled inguinal hernias inguinal hernias are further divided into the more common indirect inguinal hernia 23 depicted here in which the inguinal canal is entered via a congenital weakness at its entrance the internal inguinal ring and the direct inguinal hernia type 13 where the hernia contents push through a weak spot in the back wall of the inguinal canal inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia in both men and women in some selected cases they may require surgery femoral hernias occur just below the inguinal ligament when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the femoral canal they can be hard to distinguish from the inguinal type especially when ascending cephalad however they generally appear more rounded and in contrast to inguinal hernias there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias the incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high repair techniques are similar for femoral and inguinal hernia they involve protrusion of intraabdominal contents through a weakness at the site of passage of the umbilical cord through the abdominal wall umbilical hernias in adults are largely acquired and are more frequent in obese or pregnant women abnormal decussation of fibers at the linea alba may contribute an incisional hernia occurs when the defect is the result of an incompletely healed surgical wound when these occur in median laparotomy incisions in the linea alba they are termed ventral hernias these can be the most frustrating and difficult to treat as the repair utilizes already attenuated tissue higher in the abdomen an internal diaphragmatic hernia results when part of the stomach or intestine protrudes into the chest cavity through a defect in the diaphragm a hiatus hernia is a particular variant of this type in which the normal passageway through which the esophagus meets the stomach esophageal hiatus serves as a functional defect allowing part of the stomach to periodically herniate into the chest hiatus hernias may be either sliding in which the gastroesophageal junction itself slides through the defect into the chest or nonsliding also known as paraesophageal in which case the junction remains fixed while another portion of the stomach moves up through the defect nonsliding or paraesophageal hernias can be dangerous as they may allow the stomach to rotate and obstruct repair is usually advised a congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a distinct problem occurring in up to 1 in 2000 births and requiring pediatric surgery intestinal organs may herniate through several parts of the diaphragm posterolateral in bochdaleks triangle resulting in bochdaleks hernia or anteromedialretrosternal in the cleft of larreymorgagnis foramen resulting in morgagnilarrey hernia or morgagnis hernia  since many organs or parts of organs can herniate through many orifices it is very difficult to give an exhaustive list of hernias with all synonyms and eponyms the above article deals mostly with visceral hernias where the herniating tissue arises within the abdominal cavity other hernia types and unusual types of visceral hernias are listed below in alphabetical order the benefits of the use of an external devices to maintain reduction of the hernia without repairing the underlying defect such as hernia trusses trunks belts etc is unclear  surgery is recommended for some types of hernias to prevent complications like obstruction of the bowel or strangulation of the tissue although umbilical hernias and hiatus hernias may be watched or are treated with medication  most abdominal hernias can be surgically repaired but surgery has complications time needed for recovery after treatment is reduced if hernias are operated on laparoscopically however open surgery can be done sometimes without general anesthesia uncomplicated hernias are principally repaired by pushing back or reducing the herniated tissue and then mending the weakness in muscle tissue an operation called herniorrhaphy if complications have occurred the surgeon will check the viability of the herniated organ and remove part of it if necessary muscle reinforcement techniques often involve synthetic materials a mesh prosthesis  the mesh is placed either over the defect anterior repair or under the defect posterior repair at times staples are used to keep the mesh in place these mesh repair methods are often called tension free repairs because unlike some suture methods eg shouldice muscle is not pulled together under tension however this widely used terminology is misleading as there are many tensionfree suture methods that do not use mesh eg desarda guarnieri liptonestrin etc evidence suggests that tensionfree methods with or without mesh often have lower percentage of recurrences and the fastest recovery period compared to tension suture methods however among other possible complications prosthetic mesh usage seems to have a higher incidence of chronic pain and sometimes infection  the frequency of surgical correction ranges from 10 per 100000 uk to 28 per 100000 us  many people are managed through day surgery centers and are able to return to work within a week or two while intense activities are prohibited for a longer period people who have their hernias repaired with mesh often recover in a number of days though pain can last longer surgical complications include pain that lasts more than three months surgical site infections nerve and blood vessel injuries injury to nearby organs and hernia recurrence pain that lasts more than three months occurs in about 10 of people following hernia repair  complications may arise postoperation including rejection of the mesh that is used to repair the hernia in the event of a mesh rejection the mesh will very likely need to be removed mesh rejection can be detected by obvious sometimes localised swelling and pain around the mesh area continuous discharge from the scar is likely for a while after the mesh has been removed a surgically treated hernia can lead to complications while an untreated hernia may be complicated by about 27 of males and 3 of females develop a groin hernia at some time in their life  inguinal femoral and abdominal hernias resulted in 51000 deaths in 2013 and 55000 in 1990

V transepithelial potential difference tepd is the voltage across an epithelium and is the sum of the membrane potentials for the outer and inner cell membranes the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis cf is usually based on high sweat chloride concentrations characteristic clinical findings including sinopulmonary infections andor family history however a small portion of patients with cystic fibrosis especially those with mild mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ion channel cftr have nearnormal sweat tests in these cases a useful diagnostic adjunct involves measuring the nasal transepithelial potential difference ie the charge on the respiratory epithelial surface as compared to interstitial fluid individuals with cystic fibrosis have a significantly more negative nasoepithelial surface than normal due to increased luminal sodium absorption in most exocrine glands the cftr protein normally secretes chloride ions into the lumen and also has a tonic inhibitory effect on the opening of the apical sodium channel which absorbs sodium into the cell impaired cftr functioning directly reduces ductal epithelial chloride secretion and indirectly increases sodium absorption through lack of cftrs inhibitory effect on the apical sodium channel the result is dehydrated mucus and a widened negative transepithelial potential difference the nasal tepd is increased in cystic fibrosis making it a potential diagnostic tool for this disorder  in the kidney tepd contributes to tubular reabsorption

V hydranencephaly or hydrancephaly   is a condition in which the brains cerebral hemispheres are absent to varying degrees and the remaining cranial cavity is filled with cerebrospinal fluid  hydranencephaly or hydrancephaly  is a type of cephalic disorder these disorders are congenital conditions that derive from either damage to or abnormal development of the fetal nervous system in the earliest stages of development in utero cephalic is the medical term for head or head end of body these conditions do not have any definitive identifiable cause factor instead generally attributed to a variety of hereditary or genetic conditions but also by environmental factors such as maternal infection pharmaceutical intake or even exposure to high levels of radiation  this should not be confused with hydrocephalus which is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles in hemihydranencephaly only half of the cranial cavity is filled with fluid    usually the cerebellum and brain stem are formed normally although in some cases the cerebellum may also be absent an infant with hydranencephaly may appear normal at birth or may have some distortion of the skull and upper facial features due to fluid pressure inside the skull the infants head size and spontaneous reflexes such as sucking swallowing crying and moving the arms and legs may all seem normal depending on the severity of the condition however after a few weeks the infant sometimes becomes irritable and has increased muscle tone hypertonia after several months of life seizures and hydrocephalus may develop if they did not exist at birth other symptoms may include visual impairment lack of growth deafness blindness spastic quadriparesis paralysis and intellectual deficits some infants may have additional abnormalities at birth including seizures myoclonus involuntary sudden rapid jerks limited thermoregulation abilities and respiratory problems still other infants display no obvious symptoms at birth going many months without a confirmed diagnosis of hydranencephaly in some cases a severe hydrocephalus or other cephalic condition is misdiagnosed hydranencephaly is an extreme form of porencephaly which is characterized by a cyst or cavity in the cerebral hemispheres although the exact cause of hydranencephaly remains undetermined in most cases the most likely general cause is by vascular insult such as stroke or injury intrauterine infections or traumatic disorders after the first trimester of pregnancy in a number of cases where intrauterine infection was determined the causing factor most involved toxoplasmosis and viral infections such as enterovirus adenovirus parvovirus cytomegalic herpes simplex epsteinbarr and syncytial viruses another cause factor is determined to be monochorionic twin pregnancies involving the death of one twin in the second trimester which in turn causes vascular exchange to the living twin through placental circulation through twintotwin transfusion causing hydranencephaly in the surviving fetus  one medical journal reports hydranencephaly as an autosomal inherited disorder with an unknown mode of transmission where an unknown blockage of the carotid artery where it enters the cranium causes obstruction and damage to the cerebral cortex  as a recessive genetic condition both parents must carry the asymptomatic gene and pass it along to their child a chance of 25 percent despite determination of cause hydranencephaly afflicts both males and females in equal numbers though hydranencephaly is typically a congenital disorder it can occur as a postnatal diagnosis in the aftermath of meningitis intracerebral infarction and ischemia stroke or other traumatic brain injury  diagnosis may be delayed for several months because the infants early behavior appears to be relatively normal transillumination an examination in which light is passed through body tissues can be used to diagnose hydranencephaly an accurate confirmed diagnosis is generally impossible until after birth though prenatal diagnosis using fetal ultrasonography ultrasound can identify characteristic physical abnormalities that exist through thorough clinical evaluation via physical findings detailed patient history and advanced imaging techniques such as angiogram computerized tomography ct scan magnetic resonance imaging mri or more rarely transillumination after birth are the most accurate diagnostic techniques  however diagnostic literature fails to provide a clear distinction between severe obstructive hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly leaving some children with an unsettled diagnosis  preliminary diagnosis may be made in utero via standard ultrasound and can be confirmed with a standard anatomy ultrasound this sometimes proves to provide a misdiagnosis of differential diagnoses including bilaterally symmetric schizencephaly a less destructive developmental process on the brain severe hydrocephalus cerebrospinal fluid excess within the skull and alobar holoprosencephaly a neurological developmental anomaly once destruction of the brain is complete the cerebellum midbrain thalami basal ganglia choroid plexus and portions of the occipital lobes typically remain preserved to varying degrees though the cerebral cortex is absent in most cases the fetal head remains enlarged due to the continued production by the choroid plexus of cerebrospinal fluid that is inadequately reabsorbed causing increased intracranial pressure  this condition possesses isolated occurrences affecting less than 1 in 10000 births worldwide  and officially classifying hydranencephaly as a rare disorder by affecting fewer than 1 in 250000 in the united states  there is no standard treatment for hydranencephaly treatment is symptomatic and supportive hydrocephalus may be treated with surgical treatment of a shunt which often grants a much better prognosis and greater quality of life  the prognosis for children with hydranencephaly is generally quite poor death often occurs in the first year of life  but other children may live several years the oldest known person living with hydranencephaly is 33 years old as of august 2013  medical text identifies that hydranencephalic children simply have only their brain stem function remaining thus leaving formal treatment options as symptomatic and supportive  severe hydrocephalus causing macrocephaly a larger than average head circumference can easily be managed by placement of a shunt  and often displays a misdiagnosis of another lesser variation of cephalic condition due to the blanketing nature of hydrocephalus  plagiocephaly the asymmetrical distortion of the skull is another typical associated condition that is easily managed through positioning and strengthening exercises to prevent torticollis a constant spasm or extreme tightening of the neck muscles

V opsismodysplasia is a type of skeletal dysplasia a bone disease that interferes with bone development first described by zonana and associates in 1977 and designated under its current name by maroteaux 1984 derived from the greek opsismos late the name opsismodysplasia describes a delay in bone maturation in addition to this delay the disorder is characterized by micromelia short or undersized bones particularly of the hands and feet delay of ossification bone cell formation platyspondyly flattened vertebrae irregular metaphyses an array of facial aberrations and respiratory distress related to chronic infection opsismodysplasia is congenital being apparent at birth it has a variable mortality with some affected individuals living to adulthood the disorder is rare with an incidence of less than 1 per 1000000 worldwide it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means the defective mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on an autosome and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited no specific gene has been found to be associated with the disorder it is similar to spondylometaphyseal dysplasia sedaghatian type        opsismodysplasia can be characterized by a delay in bone maturation which refers to bone aging an expected sequence of developmental changes in the skeleton corresponding to the chronological age of a person factors such as gender and ethnicity also play a role in bone age assessment the only indicator of physical development that can be applied from birth through mature adulthood is bone age specifically the age and maturity of bone can be determined by its state of ossification the agerelated process whereby certain cartilaginous and soft tissue structures are transformed into bone the condition of epiphyseal plates growth plates at the ends of the long bones which includes those of the arms hands legs and feet is another measurement of bone age the evaluation of both ossification and the state of growth plates in children is often reached through radiography xrays of the carpals bones of the hand and wrist      in opsismodysplasia the process of ossification in long bones can be disrupted by a failure of ossification centers a center of organization in long bones where cartilage cells designated to await and undergo ossification gather and align in rows  to form this was observed in a 16monthold boy with the disorder who had no apparent ossification centers in the carpals bones of the hand and wrist or tarsals bones of the foot this was associated with an absence of ossification in these bones as well as disfigurement of the hands and feet at age two the boy also had no ossification occurring in the lower femur thigh bone and upper tibia the shin bone  opsismodysplasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner  this means the defective genes responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome and two copies of the defective gene one inherited from each parent are required in order to be born with the disorder the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder currently no specific mutation in any gene has been found to cause the disorder   it appears that the gene inositol polyphosphate phosphataselike 1 is the cause of this condition in at least some cases  the disorder was first described by jonathan zonana and associates in 1977  further observation of four cases of it was reported by pierre maroteaux and colleagues in 1982  and maroteaux was the first to call the disorder opsismodysplasia in a 1984 journal report of three affected individuals  the name derives from the greek opsismos meaning late  while the term dysplasia refers to development opsismodysplasia is a very rare disorder and is estimated to occur in less than 1 in 1000000 people

V mdp syndrome also known as mandibular dysplasia with deafness and progeroid features is an extremely rare metabolic disorder that prevents fatty tissue from being stored underneath the skin it is only known to affect a very small number of people worldwide less than 10 cases have been diagnosed as of december 2014 recent research has suggested that it may be caused by an abnormality of the pold1 gene on chromosome 19 which causes an enzyme crucial to dna replication to be defective   the diagnosis of mdp syndrome is suggested by the clinical features   it can be confirmed by finding a mutation in the pold1 gene a service offered by the molecular genetics team at the royal devon and exeter nhs foundation trust  exeter university who originally discovered the genetic cause initially all people that have been identified with this syndrome have an identical genetic change an inframe single codon deletion in pold1 resulting in a loss of serine at position 605  the pold1 gene is expressed in all cells and the particular change seen in most patients results in loss of dna polymerase activity but only mildly impairs the proof reading exonuclease activity in 2014 a second genetic change was reported in an italian patient a novel heterozygous mutation in exon 13 r507c  most cases identified to date  have been caused by a spontaneous genetic change so the parents of the individual are unaffected appearance at birth and during the early years is normal but features become more prominent during later childhood prior to puberty the main issues appear to be lipodystrophy see below and slow growth of cartilage and ligaments the slow growth of cartilage and ligaments results in a small nose small mandible jaw small ears and tightening of ligaments in the limbs a small larynx due to the reduced growth of cartilage can mean the voice is likely to remain high pitched even in boys after puberty a major feature is lipodystrophy a reduction in fat under the skin the characteristic changes in facial appearance occur from the loss of fat from the cheeks and around the eyes dry eyes and the failure to close eyes during sleep can be a feature due to the loss of fat around the eyes rather than any excessive prominence of the eyeballs limbs appear very thin due to lack of fat storage and also reduced muscle mass there is a large amount of fat within the abdominal cavity which can be particularly marked in the liver but not always and surrounds the other organs a major result of the lipodystrophy in some people is severe insulin resistance so insulin does not work very well leading to diabetes and high triglyceride levels in the blood the effect of insulin resistance can be variable and may relate to progression of the lipodystrophy or may reflect variation between individuals the skin has a lack of fat and fibrosis these in turn result in the tight skin on the face and limbs one direct feature of the lipodystrophy is that the skin is fragile and there is not the protection normally provided by fat under the skin as fat cannot be stored under the skin it is important to have a healthy diet without excess fat often due to failure to thrive or lack of subcutaneous fat there may have been encouragement to add supplements or fat to the diet however this will not result in any increase in fat under the skin and can easily result in it going into tissues such as the liver or kidney where it is not desired in people with moderate  severe lipodystrophy a low fat diet would be recommended but in those where the lipodystrophy has not progressed for example in younger children a healthy relatively low fat diet may be sufficient the fat and muscle reduction is not the result of dietary insufficiency and cannot be treated with dietary measures apart from diet the other thing that is important is exercise which should be encouraged and will make insulin work more effectively in those who have not developed diabetes it is recommended fasting insulin triglycerides glucose and hba1c should be measured annually to monitor insulin resistance and blood glucose in those with diabetes it is suggested using metformin in doses of at least 2gday as it decreases insulin resistance and improves insulin sensitivity following appropriate clinical consultation the thin skin means if there is trauma there should be rapid attention to any wounds to avoid infection and help primary healing as there can be problems with skin ulcers some males have had undescended testes but in all cases whether or not this was corrected they have hypogonadism reduced function of the testes and many may be infertile due to inadequate testicular development in females normal periods have been observed low testosterone will require testosterone replacement in peripubertal males adequate testosterone replacement is required for its anabolic affects such as growth and also the induction of puberty with high doses this needs to be coordinated with growth hormone replacement if given to avoid early closure of the epitheses ends of the bones which would reduce height although in the original clinical description short stature was included in the characteristics of mdp syndrome looking at the data closely it showed that many patients were well within the normal range if growth is of concern growth hormone therapy could be considered and coordinated with testosterone replacement where appropriate deafness is a feature of mdp syndrome as a result of the nerves not working well and people often have difficulty getting hearing aids because of the small size of their ears digital hearing aids can be helpful and audiometry follow up will be needed there may be different problems associated with mdp syndrome in the feet the lack of subcutaneous fat means that there is direct pressure on the skin resulting in callus hard skin on the heels and also the weightbearing parts of the forefoot this is best managed by trying to find insoles to support the foot but its difficult to avoid completely there is no approach that will increase the subcutaneous fat the second feature is clawed toes as a result of contraction of the long extender tendons the contractured constrictions can get worse over time it is worth considering a physiotherapy referral with an aim to establish exercises to try and keep the tendons stretched if possible the failure of growth of the mandible lower jaw can rapidly result in dental overcrowding in this case it is best to remove teeth early rather than hoping that there will be mandibular lower jaw growth overcrowding can result in the teeth being severely displaced and again it is best to act early because later correction orthodontically can be extremely difficult many people with mdp syndrome are high achievers intellectually following careers in law medicine and computing a crucial point is that they do not have progeria and there is no evidence of accelerated intellectual decline with age in these patients equally life expectancy has not been shown to be reduced patients of 65 have been described in the literature and none of the patients are known to have malignancy therefore there are many crucial differences with progeria and the name of progeroid in the title is confusing as this really refers to the lack of fat in the face and taut skin and not any intellectual or other age associated features it is helpful to coordinate clinical care as much as possible this may be managed best by a consultant endocrinologist as the most active management is going to relate to the management of lipodystrophy insulin resistance diabetes and testosterone replacement therapy and growth hormone replacement if required other local specialists could provide care when this is needed the condition was diagnosed by researchers at the university of exeter medical school and molecular genetics department at the royal devon and exeter hospital british paracyclist tom staniford is reported to suffer from this condition

V ehlersdanlos syndrome eds is an inherited connective tissue disorder with different presentations that have been classified into several primary types eds is caused by a defect in the structure production or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen such as mutations in the col5a or col3a genes this is the collagen of granulation tissue and is produced quickly by young fibroblasts before the tougher type i collagen is synthesized commonly associated with keloid formation reticular fiber and found in artery walls skin intestines and the uteruscol3a1 the collagen in connective tissue helps tissues resist deformation collagen is an important contributor to the physical strength of skin joints muscles ligaments blood vessels and visceral organs abnormal collagen renders these structures more elastic in some cases the severity of the mutation can be lifethreatening eds can have neuromuscular complications  including ocular and ophthalmic complications  there is no cure for eds and treatment is supportive including close monitoring of the digestive excretory and particularly the cardiovascular systems occupational and physical therapy bracing and corrective surgery may help with the frequent injuries and pain that tend to develop in certain types of eds although extra caution and special practices are advised to prevent permanent damage eds is a chronic pain disease with patients suffering daily  people with eds are often misdiagnosed with hypochondriasis depression chronic fatigue syndrome and other conditions  because eds is considered an invisible disability   and there is generally poor knowledge about eds among practitioners    many sufferers of eds have psychological difficulties as a result of frustration with the medical system and the socially inconvenient combination of appearing normal while being in severe pain     to deal with these issues interest groups have tried to raise awareness about eds among medical professionals   the features of eds were first described by hippocrates in 400 bc the syndrome is named after two physicians edvard ehlers from denmark and henrialexandre danlos from france who described it at the turn of the 20th century     in the past there were 10 recognized types of ehlersdanlos syndrome in 1997 researchers proposed a simpler classification that reduced the number of major types to six and gave them descriptive names  these six major types are listed here other types of the condition may exist but they have been reported only in single families or are not well characterized except for hypermobility some of the specific mutations involved have been identified and they can be precisely identified by genetic testing this is valuable due to a great deal of variation in individual cases however negative genetic test results do not rule out the diagnosis since not all of the mutations have been discovered therefore the clinical presentation is very important  although the classifications are well defined it is rare for a case to fit neatly in a single category and crossover symptoms lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis therefore patients should not rely on the fact of having a certain type of eds if crossover symptoms are evident because of possibly lifethreatening symptoms for example it is possible for an individual with classical eds to exhibit symptoms of hypermobility or vascular eds in order of prevalence in the population the classifications are overall research statistics of eds show the prevalence as 1 in 2500 to 1 in 5000 people recent clinical experience suggests that this condition goes underdiagnosed and the condition is more common than these ratios indicate  forms of eds in this category may present with soft mildly stretchable skin shortened bones chronic diarrhea joint hypermobility and dislocation bladder rupture or poor wound healing inheritance patterns in this group include xlinked recessive autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive examples of types of related syndromes other than those above reported in the medical literature include signs vary widely based on which type of eds the patient has in each case however the signs are ultimately due to faulty or reduced amounts of collagen eds typically affects the joints skin and blood vessels following is a list of major signs and symptoms because it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in childhood some instances of ehlersdanlos syndrome have been mischaracterized as child abuse  the pain associated with this condition is a serious complication as mentioned under classification above only some variations of ehlersdanlos can be positively identified as tied to specific genetic variation as opposed to epigenetic or environmental factors mutations in the following genes can cause subtypes of the ehlersdanlos syndrome mutations in these genes usually alter the structure production or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissue a defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin bones blood vessels and organs resulting in the features of the disorder  inheritance patterns depend on the type of ehlersdanlos syndrome most forms of the condition are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause the disorder the minority are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the condition it can also be an individual de novo or sporadic mutation refer to the summary for each type of ehlersdanlos syndrome for a discussion of its inheritance pattern  a diagnosis can be made by an evaluation of medical history and clinical observation the brighton criteria are widely used to assess the degree of joint hypermobility dna and biochemical studies can help identify affected individuals diagnostic tests include collagen gene mutation testing collagen typing via skin biopsy echocardiogram and lysyl hydroxylase or oxidase activity however these tests are not able to confirm all cases especially in instances of an unmapped mutation so clinical evaluation by a geneticist remains essential if there are multiple affected individuals in a family it may be possible to perform prenatal diagnosis using a dna information technique known as a linkage study  there are several disorders that share some characteristics with ehlersdanlos syndrome for example in cutis laxa the skin is loose hanging and wrinkled in eds the skin can be pulled away from the body but is elastic and returns to normal when let go in marfan syndrome the joints are very mobile and similar cardiovascular complications occur people with eds tend to have a marfanoid appearance eg tall skinny long arms and legs spidery fingers however physical appearance and features in several types of ehlersdanlos syndrome also have characteristics including short stature large eyes and the appearance of a small mouth and chin due to a small palate the palate can have a high arch causing dental crowding blood vessels can sometimes be easily seen through translucent skin especially on the chest in the past menkes disease a copper metabolism disorder was thought to be a form of ehlersdanlos syndrome it is not uncommon for patients to be misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia bleeding disorders or other disorders that can mimic eds symptoms before a correct diagnosis is made because of these similar disorders and complications that can arise from an unmonitored case of eds a correct diagnosis is very important  pseudoxanthoma elasticum pxe is worth consideration in diagnosing a patient there is no cure for ehlers danlos syndrome treatment is palliative close monitoring of the cardiovascular system physiotherapy occupational therapy and orthopedic instruments eg wheelchairs bracing casting may be helpful orthopedic instruments are helpful for the prevention of further joint damage especially for long distances although it is advised that individuals not become dependent on them until there are no other options for mobility one should avoid activities that cause the joint to lock or overextend  a physician may prescribe casting to stabilize joints physicians may refer a patient to an orthotist for orthotic treatment bracing physicians may also consult a physical andor occupational therapist to help strengthen muscles and to teach people how to properly use and preserve their joints    there are different types of physiotherapy aquatic therapy promotes muscular development and coordination  with manual therapy the joint will be gently mobilized within the range of motion andor manipulations   electrotherapy like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation reduces local musculoskeletal pain   if conservative therapy is not helpful surgical repair of joints may be necessary medication to decrease pain or manage cardiac digestive or other related conditions may be prescribed to decrease bruising and improve wound healing some patients have responded to ascorbic acid vitamin c  special precautions are often taken by medical care workers because of the sheer amount of complications that tend to arise in eds patients in vascular eds signs of chest or abdominal pain are to be considered trauma situations in general medical intervention is limited to symptomatic therapy before pregnancy patients with eds should have genetic counseling children with eds should be provided with information about the disorder so they can understand why contact sports and other physically stressful activities should be avoided children should be taught early on that demonstrating the unusual positions they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done as this may cause early degeneration of the joints patients may find it hard to cope with the drawbacks of the disease in this case emotional support and behavioral and psychological therapy can be useful support groups can be immensely helpful for patients dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health family members teachers and friends should be informed about eds so they can accept and assist the child  despite all these types of conservative therapy except bracing results show that conservative therapy is ineffective in contrast to midcarpal instability in normal patients l rombaut showed that in almost 40 of the cases conservative therapy has a neutral or even a negative outcome  conservative therapy may be unsuccessful in controlling instability in the longer term  the instability of joints leading to subluxations and joint pain often require surgical intervention in patients with ehlersdanlos syndrome instability of almost all joints can happen but appear most often in the lower and upper extremities with the wrist fingers shoulder knee hip and ankle being most common  common surgical procedures are joint debridement tendon replacements capsulorraphy and arthroplasty studies have shown that after surgery degree of stabilization pain reduction and patient satisfaction can improve but surgery does not guarantee an optimal result patients and surgeons report being dissatisfied with the results consensus is that conservative treatment is more effective than surgery  particularly since patients have extra risks of surgical complications due to the disease three basic surgical problems arise due to eds the strength of the tissues is decreased which makes the tissue less suitable for surgery the fragility of the blood vessels can cause problems during surgery and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete  studies have shown that local anesthetics arterial catheters and central venous catheters cause a higher risk in haematoma formation in patients with ehlersdanlos syndrome ehlersdanlos patients also show a resistance to local anaesthetics  special recommendations for anesthesia in eds patients are prepared by orphan anesthesiaeu and deal with all aspects of anesthesia for eds patients  detailed recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative care of patients with eds should be used to improve patient safety  surgery with ehlersdanlos patients requires careful tissue handling and a longer immobilization afterward the outlook for individuals with eds depends on the type of eds they have symptoms vary in severity even within one subtype and the frequency of complications changes individually some people have negligible symptoms while others are severely restricted in their daily life extreme joint instability chronic musculoskeletal pain degenerative joint disease frequent injuries and spinal deformities may limit mobility severe spinal deformities may affect breathing in the case of extreme joint instability dislocations may result from simple tasks such as rolling over in bed or turning a doorknob secondary conditions such as autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular problems occurring in any type can affect prognosis and quality of life severe mobilityrelated disability is seen more often in hypermobilitytype than in classicaltype or vasculartype  although all types are potentially lifethreatening the majority of individuals will have a normal lifespan however those with blood vessel fragility have a high risk of fatal complications arterial rupture is the most common cause of sudden death in eds spontaneous arterial rupture most often occurs in the second or third decade but can occur at any time the median lifeexpectancy in the population with vascular eds is 48 years  eds is a lifelong condition affected individuals may face social obstacles related to their disease daily some people with eds have reported living with fear of significant and painful ruptures their condition worsening becoming unemployed due to physical and emotional burdens and social stigmatization in general  ehlersdanlos syndrome is an inherited disorder estimated to occur in about 1 in 5000 births worldwide initially prevalence estimates ranged from 1 in 250000 to 1 in 500000 people but these estimates were soon found to be vastly inaccurate as the disorder received further study and medical professionals became more adept at accurately diagnosing eds in fact many experts now believe that ehlersdanlos syndrome may be far more common than the currently accepted estimate due to the wide range of severities with which the disorder presents  the prevalence of the six types differs dramatically the most commonly occurring is the hypermobility type followed by the classical type the other types of ehlersdanlos syndrome are very rare for example fewer than 10 infants and children with the dermatosparaxis type have been described worldwide ehlersdanlos affects males and females of all racial and ethnic backgrounds although some types are more common among certain groups than others ehlersdanloslike syndromes have been shown to be hereditary in himalayan cats some domestic shorthair cats and in certain breeds of cattle it is seen as a sporadic condition in domestic dogs degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis dsld is a similar condition seen in many breeds of horses though it was originally notated in the peruvian paso and thought to be a condition of overwork and older age the disease is being recognized in all age groups and all activity levels it has even been noted in newborn foals the latest research has led to the renaming of the disease as equine systemic proteoglycan accumulation after the possible systemic and hereditary components being delineated by the university of georgia

V 3604 12952 a teratoma is a tumor with tissue or organ components resembling normal derivatives of more than one germ layer although the teratoma may be monodermal or polydermal originating from one or more germ layers its cells may differentiate in ways suggesting other germ layers the tissues of a teratoma although normal in themselves may be quite different from surrounding tissues and may be highly disparate teratomas have been reported to contain hair teeth bone and very rarely more complex organs or processes such as eyes   torso   and hands feet or other limbs  usually a teratoma will contain no organs but rather one or more tissues normally found in organs such as the brain thyroid liver and lung sometimes the teratoma has within its capsule one or more fluidfilled cysts when a large cyst occurs there is a potential for the teratoma to produce a structure within the cyst that resembles a fetus because they are encapsulated teratomas are usually benign although several forms of malignant teratoma are known and some of these are common forms of teratoma a mature teratoma is typically benign and found more commonly in women while an immature teratoma is typically malignant and is more often found in men teratomas are thought to be present at birth congenital but small ones often remain undiscovered until much later in life definitive medical diagnosis of a teratoma is based on its histology as is true throughout oncology the study of tumors malignant and benign the nomenclature for these tumors continually evolves on the basis of threads of consensus in the scientific literature regarding the tumors classification which is based on shared embryologic origins clinicopathologic characteristics and so on as science advances more is understood about how one can differentiate tumors that formerly seemed alike for example the scientific knowledge of tumor markers genomics and proteomics regularly advances in this environment tumor names may slip over the years between synonymity hyponymy and hypernymy and deprecation some terms that have been synonymous with teratoma include dysembryoma teratoblastoma organoid tumor and teratoid tumor  the words teratoma and mature teratoma both have been used to refer to a benign growth while the word teratoma may also refer to immature teratoma a cancerous growth avoiding misunderstanding due to such polysemy is part of why tumor nomenclature changes over decades the nomenclatural changes are voluntary based on scientists agreeing or debating in the literature regarding what to call particular neoplastic entities types of tumors the term malignant teratoma has sometimes been used as a synonym for nonseminomatous germ cell tumor  teratomas of germ cell origin usually are found ie present in adult men and women but they may also be found in children and infants teratomas of embryonal origin are most often found in babies at birth in young children and since the advent of ultrasound imaging in fetuses the most commonly diagnosed fetal teratomas are sacrococcygeal teratoma altman types i ii and iii and cervical neck teratoma because these teratomas project from the fetal body into the surrounding amniotic fluid they can be seen during routine prenatal ultrasound exams teratomas within the fetal body are less easily seen with ultrasound for these mri of the pregnant uterus is more informative   teratomas are not dangerous for the fetus unless there is either a mass effect or a large amount of blood flow through the tumor known as vascular steal the mass effect frequently consists of obstruction of normal passage of fluids from surrounding organs the vascular steal can place a strain on the growing heart of the fetus even resulting in heart failure and thus must be monitored by fetal echocardiography after surgery there is a risk of regrowth in place or in nearby organs  teratomas belong to a class of tumors known as nonseminomatous germ cell tumor nsgct all tumors of this class are the result of abnormal development of pluripotent cells germ cells and embryonal cells teratomas of embryonic origin are congenital teratomas of germ cell origin may or may not be congenital this is not known the kind of pluripotent cell appears to be unimportant apart from constraining the location of the teratoma in the body teratomas derived from germ cells occur in the testes in men and ovaries in women teratomas derived from embryonic cells usually occur on the subjects midline in the brain elsewhere in the skull in the nose in the tongue under the tongue and in the neck cervical teratoma mediastinum retroperitoneum and attached to the coccyx teratomas may also occur elsewhere very rarely in solid organs most notably the heart and liver and hollow organs such as the stomach and bladder and more commonly on the skull sutures concerning the origin of teratomas there exist numerous hypotheses  these hypotheses are not to be confused with the unrelated hypothesis that fetus in fetu see below is not a teratoma at all but rather a parasitic twin a mature teratoma is a grade 0 teratoma mature teratomas are highly variable in form and histology and may be solid cystic or a combination of solid and cystic a mature teratoma often contains several different types of tissue such as skin muscle and bone skin may surround a cyst and grow abundant hair see dermoid cyst mature teratomas generally are benign malignant mature teratomas are of several distinct types a dermoid cyst is a mature cystic teratoma containing hair sometimes very abundant and other structures characteristic of normal skin and other tissues derived from the ectoderm the term is most often applied to teratoma on the skull sutures and in the ovaries of females fetus in fetu and fetiform teratoma are rare forms of mature teratoma that include one or more components resembling a malformed fetus both forms may contain or appear to contain complete organ systems even major body parts such as torso or limbs fetus in fetu differs from fetiform teratoma in having an apparent spine and bilateral symmetry  most authorities agree that fetiform teratomas are highly developed mature teratomas the natural history of fetus in fetu is controversial  there also may be a cultural difference with fetiform teratoma being reported more often in ovarian teratomas by gynecologists and fetus in fetu being reported more often in retroperitoneal teratomas by general surgeons fetus in fetu has often been interpreted as a fetus growing within its twin as such this interpretation assumes a special complication of twinning one of several grouped under the term parasitic twin in this regard it is noteworthy that in many cases the fetus in fetu is reported to occupy a fluidfilled cyst within a mature teratoma     cysts within mature teratoma may have partially developed organ systems reports include cases of partial cranial bones long bones and a rudimentary beating heart   regardless of whether fetus in fetu and fetiform teratoma are one entity or two they are distinct from and not to be confused with ectopic pregnancy a struma ovarii literally goitre of the ovary is a rare form of mature teratoma that contains mostly thyroid tissue teratomas are thought to be present since birth or even before birth and therefore can be considered congenital tumors many teratomas are not diagnosed until much later in childhood or in adulthood large tumors are more likely to be diagnosed early on sacrococcygeal and cervical teratomas are often detected by prenatal ultrasound additional diagnostic methods may include prenatal mri in rare circumstances the tumor is so large that the fetus may be damaged or die in the case of large sacrococcygeal teratomas a significant portion of the fetus blood flow is redirected toward the teratoma a phenomenon called steal syndrome causing heart failure or hydrops of the fetus in certain cases fetal surgery may be indicated beyond the newborn period symptoms of a teratoma depend on its location and organ of origin ovarian teratomas often present with abdominal or pelvic pain caused by torsion of the ovary or irritation of its ligaments a recently discovered condition where ovarian teratomas cause encephalitis associated with antibodies against the nmethyldaspartate receptor nmdar  often simply referred to as antinmda receptor encephalitis was identified as a serious complication patients develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis memory deficits seizures and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements and autonomic and breathing instability  testicular teratomas present as a palpable mass in the testis mediastinal teratomas often cause compression of the lungs or the airways and may present with chest pain andor respiratory symptoms some teratomas contain yolk sac elements which secrete alphafetoprotein afp detection of afp may help to confirm the diagnosis and is often used as a marker for recurrence or treatment efficacy but is rarely the method of initial diagnosis maternal serum alphafetoprotein or msafp is a useful screening test for other fetal conditions including down syndrome spina bifida and abdominal wall defects such as gastroschisis regardless of location in the body a teratoma is classified according to a cancer staging system this indicates whether chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be needed in addition to surgery teratomas commonly are classified using the gonzalezcrussi  grading system 0 or mature benign 1 or immature probably benign 2 or immature possibly malignant cancerous and 3 or frankly malignant if frankly malignant the tumor is a cancer for which additional cancer staging applies teratomas are also classified by their content a solid teratoma contains only tissues perhaps including more complex structures a cystic teratoma contains only pockets of fluid or semifluid such as cerebrospinal fluid sebum or fat a mixed teratoma contains both solid and cystic parts cystic teratomas usually are grade 0 and conversely grade 0 teratomas usually are cystic grade 0 1 and 2 pure teratomas have the potential to become malignant grade 3 and malignant pure teratomas have the potential to metastasize these rare forms of teratoma with malignant transformation may contain elements of somatic non germ cell malignancy such as leukemia carcinoma or sarcoma  a teratoma may contain elements of other germ cell tumors in which case it is not a pure teratoma but rather is a mixed germ cell tumor and is malignant in infants and young children these elements usually are endodermal sinus tumor followed by choriocarcinoma finally a teratoma can be pure and not malignant yet highly aggressive this is exemplified by growing teratoma syndrome in which chemotherapy eliminates the malignant elements of a mixed tumor leaving pure teratoma which paradoxically begins to grow very rapidly a benign grade 0 mature teratoma nonetheless has a risk of malignancy recurrence with malignant endodermal sinus tumor has been reported in cases of formerly benign mature teratoma   even in fetiform teratoma and fetus in fetu   squamous cell carcinoma has been found in a mature cystic teratoma at the time of initial surgery  a grade 1 immature teratoma that appears to be benign eg because afp is not elevated has a much higher risk of malignancy and requires adequate followup     this grade of teratoma also may be difficult to diagnose correctly it can be confused with other small round cell neoplasms such as neuroblastoma small cell carcinoma of hypercalcemic type primitive neuroectodermal tumor wilms tumor desmoplastic small round cell tumor and nonhodgkin lymphoma  a teratoma with malignant transformation tmt is a very rare form of teratoma that may contain elements of somatic non germ cell malignant tumors such as leukemia carcinoma or sarcoma  of 641 children with pure teratoma nine developed tmt  five carcinoma two glioma and two embryonal carcinoma here these last are classified among germ cell tumors extraspinal ependymoma usually considered to be a glioma a type of nongerm cell tumor may be an unusual form of mature teratoma  the treatment of choice is complete surgical removal ie complete resection   teratomas are normally wellencapsulated and noninvasive of surrounding tissues hence they are relatively easy to resect from surrounding tissues exceptions include teratomas in the brain and very large complex teratomas that have pushed into and become interlaced with adjacent muscles and other structures prevention of recurrence does not require en bloc resection of surrounding tissues for malignant teratomas usually surgery is followed by chemotherapy teratomas that are in surgically inaccessible locations or are very complex or are likely to be malignant due to late discovery andor treatment sometimes are treated first with chemotherapy although often described as benign a teratoma does have malignant potential in a uk study of 351 infants and children diagnosed with benign teratoma reported 227 with mt 124 with it five years after surgery eventfree survival was 922 and 859 respectively and overall survival was 99 and 951  a similar study in italy reported on 183 infants and children diagnosed with teratoma at 10 years after surgery event free and overall survival were 904 and 98 respectively  depending on which tissues it contains a teratoma may secrete a variety of chemicals with systemic effects some teratomas secrete the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin \u03b2hcg which can be used in clinical practice to monitor the successful treatment or relapse in patients with a known hcgsecreting teratoma this hormone is not recommended as a diagnostic marker because most teratomas do not secrete it some teratomas secrete thyroxine in some cases to such a degree that it can lead to clinical hyperthyroidism in the patient of special concern is the secretion of alphafetoprotein afp under some circumstances afp can be used as a diagnostic marker specific for the presence of yolk sac cells within the teratoma these cells can develop into a frankly malignant tumor known as yolk sac tumor or endodermal sinus tumor adequate followup requires close observation involving repeated physical examination scanning ultrasound mri or ct and measurement of afp andor \u03b2hcg   embryonal teratomas most commonly occur in the sacrococcygeal region sacrococcygeal teratoma is the single most common tumor found in newly born humans of teratomas on the skull sutures approximately 50 are found in or adjacent to the orbit  limbal dermoid is a choristoma not a teratoma teratoma qualifies as a rare disease but is not extremely rare sacrococcygeal teratoma alone is diagnosed at birth in one out of 40000 humans given the current human population and birthrate this equals five per day or 1800 per year add to that number sacrococcygeal teratomas diagnosed later in life and teratomas in other locales and the incidence approaches ten thousand new diagnoses of teratoma per year in light of the ethical issues surrounding the source of human stem cells teratomas are being looked at as an alternative source for research because they lack the potential to grow into functional human beings ovarian teratomas have been reported in mares   and in canines  teratomas also occur rarely in other species  this article

V treacher collins syndrome tcs also known as treacher collinsfranceschetti syndrome  or mandibulofacial dysostosis  is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by craniofacial deformities such as absent cheekbones   treacher collins syndrome is found in about one in 50000  births the typical physical features include downwardslanting eyes micrognathia a small lower jaw conductive hearing loss underdeveloped zygoma drooping part of the lateral lower eyelids and malformed or absent ears   the presentation of symptoms in people with treacher collins syndrome varies some individuals may be so mildly affected they remain undiagnosed others can have severe facial involvement and lifethreatening airway compromise  most of the features of tcs are bilateral and are already recognisable at birth patients are mostly characterized by these abnormalities the presence of an abnormally shaped skull is not distinctive for treacher collins syndrome but brachycephaly with bitemporal narrowing is sometimes observed  dental anomalies are seen in 60 of tcs patients these anomalies consist in tooth agenesis 33 enamel disformaties 20 and malplacement of the maxillary first molars 13 in some cases dental anomalies in combination with mandible hypoplasia result in a malocclusion this can lead to problems with food intake and the ability to close the mouth some features related to tcs are seen less frequently  facial deformity is still associated by the general public with developmental delay and lesser intelligence but intelligence of patients with tcs is usually normal the psychological and social problems associated with facial deformity may affect quality of life in a number of patients mutations in tcof1 polr1c or polr1d genes can cause treacher collins syndrome tcof1 gene mutations are the most common cause of the disorder accounting for 81 to 93 of all cases polr1c and polr1d gene mutations cause an additional 2 of cases in individuals without an identified mutation in one of these genes the genetic cause of the condition is unknown the proteins produced from the tcof1 polr1c and polr1d genes all appear to play important roles in the early development of bones and other tissues of the face these proteins are involved in the production of ribosomal rna rrna which helps assemble protein building blocks amino acids into new proteins which are essential for the normal functioning and survival of cells mutations in the tcof1 polr1c or polr1d genes reduce the production of rrna a decrease in the amount of rrna may trigger the selfdestruction apoptosis of certain cells involved in the development of facial bones and tissues the abnormal cell death could lead to the specific problems with facial development found in treacher collins syndrome however it is unclear why the effects of a reduction in rrna are limited to facial development tcof1 is the only gene currently known to be associated with tcs a mutation in this gene being found in 9095 of the individuals with tcs   however in some individuals with typical symptoms of tcs mutations in tcof1 have not been found  investigation of the dna has resulted in the identification of the kind of mutations found in tcof1 the majority of mutations are small deletions or insertions though splice site and missense mutations also have been identified     mutation analysis has unveiled more than 100 diseasecausing mutations in tcof1 which are mostly familyspecific mutations the only recurrent mutation accounts for about 17 of the cases  tcof1 codes for a relatively simple nucleolar protein called treacle  mutations in tcof1 lead to haploinsufficiency of the treacle protein  haploinsufficiency occurs when a diploid organism has only one functional copy of a gene because the other copy is inactivated by a mutation thereby the other functional gene does not produce enough of a geneproduct to have the expected function resulting in an abnormal disease state haploinsufficiency of the treacle protein leads to a depletion of the neural crest cell precursor which leads to a reduced number of crest cells migrating to the first and second pharyngeal arches these crest cells play an important role in the development of the craniofacial appearance   so down regulation of treacle expression results in craniofacial defects and growth retardation tcs is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and the penetrance of the affected gene is almost complete  some recent investigations though described some rare cases in which the penetrance in tcs was not complete causes may be a variable expressivity an incomplete penetrance   or germline mosaicism  only 40 of the mutations are inherited the remaining 60 are a result of a de novo mutation  in the outcome of the disease inter and intrafamilial variability occurs this suggests when an affected child is born it is important to investigate the parents to determine whether the affected gene is present a parent could have a mild and undiagnosed tcs in this case the risk of having another affected child is 50 if the parents do not have the affected gene the recurrence risk appears to be low  in following generations the severity of the clinical symptoms increases  the diagnosis of treacher collins syndrome relies upon clinical and radiographic findings a set of typical symptoms occurs within treacher collins syndrome which can be detected by a critical clinical view the wide spectrum of diseases which have similar characteristics make it sometimes difficult to diagnose tcs  the omens classification was developed as a comprehensive and stagebased approach to differentiate the diseases this acronym describes five distinct dysmorphic manifestations namely orbital asymmetry mandibular hypoplasia auricular deformity nerve development and softtissue disease the table below shows the omens classification in more detail  orbit mandible ear facial nerve soft tissue radiologic manifestations can be used to confirm the diagnosis imaging evaluation consists of xrays radiographs ct scans mri andor ultrasound a few techniques are used to confirm the diagnosis in tcs an orthopantomogram opg is a panoramic dental xray of the upper and lower jaw it shows a twodimensional image from ear to ear particularly opg facilitates an accurate postoperative followup and monitoring of bone growth under a mono or doubledistractor treatment thereby some tcs features could be seen on opg but better techniques are used to include the whole spectrum of tcs abnormalities instead of showing only the jaw abnormalities  another method of radiographic evaluation is taking a xray image of the whole head the lateral cephalometric radiograph in tcs shows hypoplasia of the facial bones like the malar bone mandible and the mastoid  finally occipitomental radiographs are used to detect hypoplasia or discontinuity of the zygomatic arch  a temporalbone ct using thin slices makes it possible to diagnose the degree of stenosis and atresia of the external auditory channel the status of the middle ear cavity the absent or dysplastic and rudimentary ossicles or the inner ear abnormalities such as a deficient cochlea two and threedimensional ct reconstructions with vrt and bone and skinsurfacing are helpful for more accurate staging and the threedimensional planning of mandibular and external ear reconstructive surgery other diseases have similar characteristics to treacher collins syndrome in the differential diagnosis one should consider the acrofacial dysostoses the facial appearance resembles that of treacher collins syndrome but additional limb abnormalities occur in those patients examples of these diseases are nager syndrome and miller syndrome the oculoauriculovertebral spectrum should also be considered in the differential diagnosis an example is hemifacial microsomia which primarily affects development of the ear mouth and mandible this anomaly may occur bilaterally another disease which belongs to this spectrum is goldenhar syndrome which includes vertebral abnormalities epibulbar dermoids and facial deformities  the treatment of individuals affected by tcs needs a multidisciplinary approach and may involve the intervention of different professionals the primary concerns in individuals with tcs are breathing and feeding problems which are a consequence of the hypoplasia of the mandibula and the obstruction of the hypopharynx by the tongue sometimes even a tracheostomy is necessary to maintain an adequate airway  also a gastrostomy could be necessary to assure an adequate caloric intake while protecting the airway surgery to restore a normal structure of the face is normally performed at defined ages depending on the development state  an overview of the present guidelines hearing loss in treacher collins syndrome is caused by deformed structures in the outer and middle ear the hearing loss is generally bilateral with a conductive loss of about 5070db even in cases with normal auricles and open external auditory canals the ossicular chain is often malformed  attempts to surgically reconstruct the external auditory canal and improve hearing in children with tcs have not yielded positive results  auditory rehabilitation with boneanchored hearing aids bahas or a conventional bone conduction aid has proven preferable to surgical reconstruction  for patients with treacher collins syndrome bahas provide several advantages the syndrome occurs in one in 50000 live births it is named after edward treacher collins 18621932 the english surgeon and ophthalmologist who described its essential traits in 1900  in 1949 adolphe franceschetti and david klein described the same condition on their own observations as mandibulofacial dysostosis the term mandibulofacial dysostosis is used to describe the clinical features  a july 1977 new york times article  that was reprinted in numerous newspapers nationwide over the ensuing weeks brought this malady to many peoples attention for the first time while a student at temple university bob saget directed an 11minute documentary about his sevenyearold nephew adam who was undergoing cranial surgery to correct his symptoms of treacher collins syndrome the documentary through adams eyes went on to win a 1978 student academy award treacher collins syndrome was featured in the 2005 discovery channel documentary unmasked treacher collins syndrome as of 2008 it was still being shown on discovery health and the tlc channels the disorder was featured on the show niptuck in the episode blu mondae  tlcs born without a face  features juliana wetmore who was born with the most severe case in medical history of this syndrome and is missing

V microtia is a congenital deformity where the pinna external ear is underdeveloped a completely undeveloped pinna is referred to as anotia because microtia and anotia have the same origin it can be referred to as microtiaanotia  microtia can be unilateral one side only or bilateral affecting both sides microtia occurs in 1 out of about 800010000 births in unilateral microtia the right ear is most commonly affected it may occur as a complication of taking accutane isotretinoin during pregnancy    there are four grades of microtia the goal of medical intervention is to provide the best form and function to the underdeveloped ear typically testing is first done to determine the quality of hearing this can be done as early as in the first two weeks with a baer test brain stem auditory response test   at age 56 ct or cat scans of the middle ear can be done to elucidate its development and clarify which patients are appropriate candidates for surgery to improve hearing for younger individuals this is done under sedation the hearing loss associated with congenital aural atresia is a conductive hearing losshearing loss caused by inefficient conduction of sound to the inner ear essentially children with aural atresia have hearing loss because the sound cannot travel into the usually healthy inner earthere is no ear canal no eardrum and the small ear bones malleushammer incusanvil and stapesstirrup are underdeveloped usually is in parentheses because rarely a child with atresia also has a malformation of the inner ear leading to a sensorineural hearing loss as many as 19 in one study  sensorineural hearing loss is caused by a problem in the inner ear the cochlea sensorineural hearing loss is not correctable by surgery but properly fitted and adjusted hearing amplification hearing aids generally provide excellent rehabilitation for this hearing loss if the hearing loss is severe to profound in both ears the child may be a candidate for a cochlear implant beyond the scope of this discussion unilateral sensorineural hearing loss was not generally considered a serious disability by the medical establishment before the nineties it was thought that the afflicted person was able to adjust to it from birth in general there are exceptional advantages to gain from an intervention to enable hearing in the microtic ear especially in bilateral microtia children with untreated unilateral sensorineural hearing loss are more likely to have to repeat a grade in school andor need supplemental services eg fm system  see below than their peers   children with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss often require years of speech therapy in order to learn how to enunciate and understand spoken language what is truly unclear and the subject of an ongoing research study is the effect of unilateral conductive hearing loss in children with unilateral aural atresia on scholastic performance if atresia surgery or some form of amplification is not used special steps should be taken to ensure that the child is accessing and understanding all of the verbal information presented in school settings recommendations for improving a childs hearing in the academic setting include preferential seating in class an fm system the teacher wears a microphone and the sound is transmitted to a speaker at the childs desk or to an ear bud or hearing aid the child wears a bone conducting hearing aid or conventional hearing aids age for baha implantation depends on whether the child is in europe 18 months or the us age 5 until then it is possible to fit a baha on a softband   it is important to note that not all children with aural atresia are candidates for atresia repair candidacy for atresia surgery is based on the hearing test audiogram and ct scan imaging if a canal is built where one does not exist minor complications can arise from the bodys natural tendency to heal an open wound closed repairing aural atresia is a very detailed and complicated surgical procedure which requires an expert in atresia repair  while complications from this surgery can arise the risk of complications is greatly reduced when using a highly experienced otologist atresia patients who opt for surgery will temporarily have the canal packed with gelatin sponge and silicone sheeting to prevent closure the timing of ear canal reconstruction canalplasty depends on the type of external ear microtia repair desired by the patient and family two surgical teams in the usa are currently able to reconstruct the canal at the same time as the external ear in a single surgical stage one stage ear reconstruction in cases where a later surgical reconstruction of the external ear of the child might be possible positioning of the baha implant is critical it may be necessary to position the implant further back than usual to enable successful reconstructive surgery  but not so far as to compromise hearing performance if the reconstruction is ultimately successful it is easy to remove the percutaneous baha abutment if the surgery is unsuccessful the abutment can be replaced and the implant reactivated to restore hearing the age when outer ear surgery can be attempted depends upon the technique chosen the earliest is 7 for rib cartilage grafts however some surgeons recommend waiting until a later age such as 810 when the ear is closer to adult size external ear prostheses have been made for children as young as 5 for auricular reconstruction there are several different options aural atresia is the underdevelopment of the middle ear and canal and usually occurs in conjunction with microtia atresia occurs because patients with microtia may not have an external opening to the ear canal though however the cochlea and other inner ear structures are usually present the grade of microtia usually correlates to the degree of development of the middle ear    microtia is usually isolated but may occur in conjunction with hemifacial microsomia goldenhar syndrome or treachercollins syndrome  it is also occasionally associated with kidney abnormalities rarely lifethreatening and jaw problems and more rarely heart defects and vertebral deformities  microtia overview  stanford childrens health

V floatingharbor syndrome also known as pelletierleisti syndrome is a rare disease with fewer than 50 cases described in the literature  it is usually diagnosed in early childhood and is characterized by the triad of proportionate short stature with delayed bone age characteristic facial appearance and delayed speech development   although its cause is unknown it is thought to result from genetic mutation and diagnosis is established by the presence of a heterozygous srcap mutation in those with clinical findings of fhs    below are the common clinical features of those diagnosed with floatingharbor syndrome patients will show varying degrees of some or all fhs symptoms facial abnormalities are the most defining aspects of those diagnosed with this disease the differential diagnosis of broad thumbs includes rubinsteintaybi syndrome where they are a cardinal feature fhs is also in the differential which logically agrees with the thought that the disease is a result of a mutation in srcap as this gene interacts with cbp  the cause of this condition is unknown but evidence of familial inheritance and sporadic genetic mutation has been linked to cases of fhs two possibly familial cases have been reportedone in a mother and son  and the other in a mother and daughter   this suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance but additional cases need to be investigated to establish this another report has suggested that the inheritance may be autosomal recessive  in all of these cases however the mothers and children were not similarly affected suggesting a variable clinical expression of the syndrome  in a study published by the american journal of human genetics in 2012 exome sequencing was used to investigate a group of unrelated individuals with classic features of fhs and identified heterozygous mutations in srcap as causative of this disorder  each reported mutation was truncating nonsense or frameshift and occurred between codons 2407 and 2517 in exon 34 resulting in the loss of three cterminal athook motifs srcap encodes a snf2related chromatinremodeling atpase that is a coactivator for crebbinding protein or cbp which is the major cause of rubinsteintaybi syndrome this disrupted interaction between the proteins most likely explains the clinical overlap between fhs and rts  thus the mechanism of disease in fhs is suspected to be dominantnegative or antimorphic due to the mutation in the final exon that results in the loss of the major transactivation function of srcap or loss of one or more critical domains all of the patients that carried the mutation also had obvious physical symptoms ie prominent nose delayed bone age and short stature those who tested negative for the mutation often had dysmorphic facial features distinct from classical fhs as well as a formal diagnosis of autism from the same group three individuals whose phenotype most closely resembled fhs carried no mutation on the srcap gene  though these findings are a large step in determining the underlying cause of fhs and widely accepted others would claim molecular diagnosis is not always successful and the mutation is not a mandatory feature for the diagnosis of fhs  until recently doctors have diagnosed patients with fhs based on clinical observations and how well they fit the disease description usually occurring in early childhood molecular genetic testing is also used now to test for genetic mutations by performing a sequence analysis test of select exons mutations can be detected in exon 34 of the srcap gene this mutation has been observed in 19 patients to date  in most cases if the patient shows classic facial features of fhs the molecular testing will show a mutation on the srcap gene  fhs shares some common features with rubinsteintaybi due to overlapping effects of mutations on srcap however cranial and hand anomalies are distinctive broad thumbs narrow palate and microcephaly are absent in floatingharbor syndrome   one child in the uk has a diagnosis of microcephaly alongside floatingharbor syndrome  there are no cures for fhs close monitoring of growth in the first few years is essential as well as annual general health screening and tests listed below an fhs diagnosis will affect the individual and those there to support them managing symptoms and features of fhs involves maintaining a close watch on the patients physical as well as mental health this would include special education programs and vocational training to address developmental disabilities are highly recommended as well as communication rehabilitation with sign language or alternative means of communication behavior management strategies could also include referrals to behavior specialists or psychologists for help for those concerned genetic counseling can be sought for issues related to testing of atrisk relatives the first identified instances occurred in 1973 at the boston floating hospital  and in 1975 at harbor general hospital in torrance california  the name floatingharbor syndrome was coined by robinson et al in 1988  since then approximately 40 more cases have been described the first case recorded was that of a 5yearold boy in a 32year follow up done in 2006  the patient was in good overall health had never been hospitalized and had been employed for the past 15 years his mother stated he had a very good memory was gregarious had a temper and at times was stubborn changes in the patients facial configuration and body could be attributed to age and familial history ie the patient shows signs of arthritis and hypertension still present were the low hairline broad tip of the nose short nasal labial distance depressed columella thin lips and posteriorly positioned ears as well as short stature and mild to moderate retardation in a study published in 2012 in the journal of pediatric endocrinology a group of scientists reported the longterm effects of a patient diagnosed with fhs undergoing growth hormone therapy from the age of 35 years to 9 years old while the gh seemed to work initially the patients growth after the first couple years slowed significantly and the patient reached a stable height far below the target or standard height  the results on gh therapy remain inconclusive recent research mostly centers around the search and confirmation of the gene responsible for fhs as discussed in the mechanisms section though the mutation of srcap is a widely accepted indicator of a patient diagnosed with fhs it is not the cause in every case

V a polydactyl cat is a cat with a congenital physical anomaly called polydactyly or polydactylism also known as hyperdactyly that causes the cat to be born with more than the usual number of toes on one or more of its paws cats with this genetically inherited trait are most commonly found along the east coast of north america in the united states and canada and in south west england and wales   the true polydactyly is a congenital abnormality genetically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait of the zrs cis element of the pd gene with incomplete penetrance  normal cats have a total of 18 toes with five toes on each front paw and four toes on each hind paw polydactyl cats may have as many as eight digits on their front andor hind paws jake a canadian polydactyl cat with 28 toes was recognised by guinness world records as having the highest number of toes on a cat  various combinations of anywhere from four to seven toes per paw are common  polydactyly is most commonly found on the front paws only it is rare for a cat to have polydactyl hind paws only and polydactyly of all four paws is even less common the nickname doublepawed cat is a misnomer since there is a specific double paw condition although this condition may be interrelated with polydactyly  feline radial hypoplasia see squitten is a mimic of polydactyly and is considered a severe condition radial hypoplasia may cause the formation of extra jointed toes but it is not a result of the gene normally associated with polydactyls it thus does not cause the mitten cat or thumb cat condition where the extra toes occur separated from the normal ones just like a dewclaw usually associated with an additional pad which makes them look like an underdeveloped foot sticking out near the base of the normal toes rather radial hypoplasiarelated extra toes are immediately adjacent to the normal ones giving the cat overly large flat feet colloquially known as patty feet or hamburger feet though this looks less serious than true polydactyly as the feet appear normal apart from having one or two extra toes breeding such cats will eventually result in severely disabled offspring cats used in polydactyl breeding programs can be screened by xray for indicators of radial hypoplasia and cats suspected to have radial hypoplasia should not be used for breeding the condition seems to be most commonly found in cats along the east coast of north america in the united states and canada and in south west england wales and kingstonuponhull polydactyl cats have been extremely popular as ships cats although there is some controversy over whether the most common variant of the trait originated as a mutation in new england or was brought there from britain there seems to be agreement that it spread widely as a result of cats carried on ships originating in boston massachusetts and the prevalence of polydactyly among the cat population of various ports correlates with the dates when they first established trade with boston   contributing to the spread of polydactyl cats by this means sailors were long known to value polydactyl cats especially for their extraordinary climbing and hunting abilities as an aid in controlling shipboard rodents some sailors also considered them to be extremely good luck when at sea genetic work studying the dna basis of the condition however indicates that many different mutations can all lead to polydactyly  and since samples from the uk and usa were shown to possess different mutations it seems likely that these cats have originated multiple times independently rather than spreading from a single origin nobel prizewinning author ernest hemingway was a famous aficionado of polydactyl cats after being first given a sixtoed cat by a ships captain upon hemingways death in 1961 his former home in key west florida became a museum and a home for his cats and it currently houses approximately fifty descendants of his cats about half of which are polydactyl because of his love for these animals polydactyl cats are sometimes referred to as hemingway cats some sources state that these cats are rare in europe because they were killed as witches familiars  but other sources indicate that they are quite common in southern britain  nicknames for polydactyl cats include conch cats boxing cats mitten cats mittenfoot cats snowshoe cats thumb cats sixfingered cats cardicats and hemingway cats two specific breeds recognized by some but not all cat fancier clubs are the american polydactyl and maine coon polydactyl and named regional populations include the boston thumb cat cardicat ithacat and vermont snowshoe cat american polydactyl cats are bred as a specific cat breed with specific physical and behavioral characteristics in addition to extra digits  the american polydactyl is not to be confused with the pedigree maine coon polydactyl the polydactyl form of the maine coon is being reinstated by some breeders  a particular strain of polydactyl cats native to ithaca new york is known as the ithacat polydactyls are very common in the cardigan area of wales where they are known as cardicats the database polytrak comprises 1800 maine coons in total as of july 2014 out of them about 1200 are polydactyl  the polytrak database service is a repository of information for the maine coon polydactyl cat details on numbers of toes are given as well as of catteries sires and dames physiological characteristics of each polydactyl individual are also stored there is no medical injury mentioned of any polydactyl maine coon individual thus polytrak could help to confirm on a broad empirical base that the polydactyl maine coon hemingway mutant has no negative healthy effects at all in the case of preaxial polydactyly of the maine coon cat hemingway mutant a mutation of the cisregulatory element zrs zpa regulator sequence is associated zrs is a noncoding element 800000 basepairs remote to the target gene shh an ectopic expression of shh is seen on the anterior side of the limb normally shh is expressed in an organiser region called the zone of polarizing activity zpa on the posterior limb side from there it diffuses anteriorly laterally to the growth direction of the limb in the mutant mirroring smaller ectopic expression in a new organiser region is seen on the posterior side of the limb this ectopic expression causes cell proliferation delivering the raw material for one or more new digits    in addition to the study of genetic causes of polydactyly limb patterning models are used to simulate the congenital disorder at the limb being able to explain the development paths of polydactyly polydactyly is a spontaneous complex phenotypic variation developed in one generation in the concrete preaxial form of the hemingway mutant the variation is induced by a single point mutation in a noncoding cisregulatory element for shh in an extensive phenotypic variation like this one or more complete digits at each single limb are developed including nerves blood vessels muscles and ligaments the physiology of the digits can be perfect this complex phenotypic result cannot be explained by the mutation alone the mutation can only induce the variation in the consequence of the mutation thousands of events each different from the wildtype occur on different organisation layers ie expression changes of other genes cellcell signal exchange cell differentiation cell and tissue growth the summarized small random changes on all layers build the raw material and the process steps for the generation of the plastic variation  the mentioned form of polydactyly of the hemingway mutant shows a biased variation in a recent empirical study first the number of extra toes of 375 mutant maine coon cats were variable polyphenism and second the number of extra toes followed a discontinuous statistical distribution they were not equally distributed as one might expect of an identical single point mutation the example demonstrates that the variation is not explained completely by the mutation alone  the maine coon wildtype 18 toes in some cases exhibits polydactyly with 18 toes were the first toe at the forehand is elongated forming a three phalangeal thumb more often 20 toes appear and in diminishing order we see 22 24 or 26 toes per individual also odd numbers of toes are seen

V potter sequence also known as potters syndrome potters sequence or oligohydramnios sequence is the atypical physical appearance of a fetus or neonate due to oligohydramnios experienced in the uterus  oligohydramnios is the decrease in amniotic fluid volume sufficient to cause deformations in morphogenesis of the fetus oligohydramnios is the causative agent of potter sequence but there are many things that can lead to oligohydramnios it can be caused by renal diseases such as bilateral renal agenesis bra atresia of the ureter or urethra causing obstruction of the urinary tract polycystic or multicystic kidney diseases renal hypoplasia amniotic rupture toxemia or uteroplacental insufficiency from maternal hypertension potters sequence is known in the medical field as clubbed feet pulmonary hypoplasia and cranial anomalies related to the oligohydramnios  the term potter sequence was initially intended to only refer to cases caused by bra  however it is now commonly used by many clinicians and researchers to refer to any case that presents with oligohydramnios or anhydramnios regardless of the source of the loss of amniotic fluid    bilateral renal agenesis bra was first recognized as a defect of human fetal development in 1671 by wolfstrigel  in 1946 edith potter 1901  1993 described a series of 20 cases with absent kidneys noting the characteristic appearance of the head and lungs   up until this time the condition itself was considered to be extremely rare however in part to potters work it has come to light that the condition presents far more frequently than previously reported potter analyzed approximately 5000 autopsy cases performed on fetuses and newborn infants over a period of ten years and found that 20 of these infants presented with bra all of which had distinctive facial characteristics which did not appear to them to have any specific embryologic correlation with the renal anomaly   it was only much later when she and others attributed the multiple congenital deformities including the features of potters facies and also pulmonary hypoplasia to have been caused by the prolonged severe lack of amniotic fluid   these facial characteristics have subsequently been termed as being known as potter facies  from her analysis she was able to deduce the sequence of events that leads to what is now known as potter sequence  potter went on to become a pioneer in the field of human renal development and her contributions are still employed and appreciated by clinicians and researchers to this day   since its initial characterization potter sequence has been defined into five distinct subclassifications there are those in the medical and research fields that use the term potter sequence to specifically refer to only cases of bra while other groups use the term to loosely refer to all instances of oligohydramnios and anhydramnios regardless of the specific cause the assignment of nomenclature to the various causes types was employed in order to help clarify these discrepancies but these subclassifications and nomenclature system have not caught on in the medical and research communities potter syndrome is not technically a syndrome as it does not collectively present with the same telltale characteristics and symptoms in each and every case it is more accurately described as a sequence or chain of events that may have different beginnings absent kidneys cystic kidneys obstructed ureters or other causes but which all end with the same conclusion absent or reduced volume of amniotic fluid this is why potter syndrome is often called potter sequence or oligohydramnios sequence by some clinicians and researchers the term potter syndrome is most frequently associated with the condition of oligohydramnios sequence regardless of the root cause of the absence or reduced volume of amniotic fluid however as noted in this article the term potter syndrome was initially coined in order to refer to fetuses and infants with bra it was not until later that the term became more encompassing as it was noted that other causes of failed fetal urine production also resulted in similar physical characteristics and prognoses of the fetuses and infants with bra that which potter originally described in 1946 since then the term potter syndrome has become a misnomer and experts have attempted not to eliminate the terminology but to modify it in a way so as to be able to determine the different root causes by creating a nomenclature system however this classification system has not caught on in the clinical and research fields classic potter sequence occurs when the developing fetus has bilateral renal agenesis which also presents with agenesis of the ureters bra has been estimated to occur at a frequency of approximately 14000 to 18000 fetuses and neonates however recent analysis has estimated that the condition may occur at a much greater frequency the condition has been reported to occur twice as commonly in males as in females suggesting that certain genes of the y chromosome may act as modifiers however no candidate genes on the y chromosome have yet been identified bra appears to have a predominantly genetic etiology and many cases represent the most severe manifestation of an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity there are several genetic pathways that could result in this condition to date few of these pathways or candidate genes have been considered or analyzed regarding bra the majority of possible candidate genetic pathways are autosomal recessive in nature and do not coincide with the frequency or penetrance at which bra occurs in the human population additionally candidate genetic pathways would be expected to involve genes expressed in the developing urogenital system ugs often these same genes andor pathways of interacting genes are also expressed in the developing ugs as well as the central nervous system cns gut lung limbs and eyes see kidney development development of the mature kidney begins between weeks 5 and 7 of gestation fetal urine production begins in early gestation and comprises the majority of the amniotic fluid in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy the fetus continuously swallows amniotic fluid which is reabsorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and then reintroduced into the amniotic cavity by the kidneys via urination oligohydramnios occurs if the volume of amniotic fluid is less than normal for the corresponding period of gestation the fetal urine is critical to the proper development of the lungs by aiding in the expansion of the airways  alveoli by means of hydrodynamic pressure and by also supplying proline which is a critical amino acid for lung development alveoli are the small sacs in the lungs that exchange oxygen with the blood if the alveoli and thereby the lungs are underdeveloped at the time of birth the infant will not be able to breathe air properly and will go into respiratory distress shortly after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia underdeveloped lungs this is the primary cause of death to potter sequence infants secondary to renal failure the fetal urine also serves to cushion the fetus from being compressed by the mothers uterus as it grows the failure of the metanephros to develop in cases of bra and some cases involving unilateral renal agenesis ura is due primarily to the failure of the mesonephric duct to produce a ureteric bud capable of inducing the metanephric mesenchyme the failed induction will thereby cause the subsequent degeneration of the metanephros by apoptosis and other mechanisms the mesonephric ducts of the agenic kidneys will also degenerates and fail to connect with the bladder therefore the means by which the fetus produces urine and transports it to the bladder for excretion into the amniotic sac has been severely compromised in the cases of ura or completely eliminated in the cases of bra the decreased volume of amniotic fluid causes the growing fetus to become compressed by the mothers uterus this compression can cause many physical deformities of the fetus most common of which is potter facies lower extremity anomalies are frequent in these cases which often presents with clubbed feet andor bowing of the legs sirenomelia or mermaid syndrome which occurs approximately in 145000 births  can also present in fact nearly all reported cases of sirenomelia also present with bra  other anomalies of the classic potter sequence infant include a parrot beak nose redundant skin and the most common characteristic of infants with bra which is a skin fold of tissue extending from the medial canthus across the cheek the ears are slightly low and pressed against the head making them appear large the adrenal glands often appear as small oval discs pressed against the posterior abdomen due to the absence of upward renal pressure the bladder is often small nondistensible and may be filled with a minute amount of fluid in males the vas deferens and seminal vesicles may be absent while in females the uterus and upper vagina may be absent other abnormalities include anal atresia absence of the rectum and sigmoid colon esophageal and duodenal atresia and a single umbilical artery presence of a diaphragmatic hernia is also common in these fetusesinfants additionally the alveolar sacs of the lungs fail to properly develop as a result of the reduced volume of amniotic fluid labor is often induced between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation however some of these pregnancies may go to term and unaborted infants typically survive for only a few minutes to a few hours these infants will eventually die as either a result of pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure in recorded medical and research history bra has proved to be lethal in all cases of singleton births various other forms of the sequence are or are near lethal in 100 of the cases an infant girl born in july 2013 to us congresswoman jaime herrera beutler has the condition and is still alive as of may 2014  a few weeks before she was born a new experimental procedure was performed on the baby a saline solution was injected on several instances into the mothers womb to help the babys lungs to develop after she was born the procedure was considered a success the infant did not need artificial respiration and could breathe on her own she is now on kidney dialysis and is awaiting a kidney transplant between the ages of one and two  while genetic research has linked certain genetic mutations to be the cause of arpkd adpkd and possibly mrd to date no genetic mutation or chromosomal anomaly has been linked to be the cause of bra chromosomal anomalies have been associated with bra in certain cases chromosomes 1 2 5 and 21 but these anomalies were not inherited and have not been observed in subsequent cases additionally neither extreme substance abuse or environmental factors high power line mercury etc have been reported to be linked to an increased incidence of bra or other cause of potter sequence bra and other causes of oligohydramnios sequence have been linked to a number of other problems to include down syndrome kallmann syndrome branchiootorenal syndrome and others the highrisk obstetrician or genetic counselor may ask for a blood sample from the fetus or will perform an amniocentesis these samples are used to perform several tests one of which may be to check for the proper number of chromosomes called a karyotype of the fetus some birth defects are known to be associated with missing a chromosome having an extra chromosome such as in down syndrome as well as by having a part of one chromosome break off and relocate to a portion of another chromosome called a translocation however on each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes are thousands of different genes while chromosomes are easy to visualize under a microscope and count the genes on them are not genes are very small pieces of dna when compared to the chromosomes they reside on a gene contains a code for a protein and if the gene is mutated different from normal the protein that is made from it may not function properly  if at all unfortunately genetic abnormalities could still exist despite having normal chromosomes the only way to determine genetically inherited mutations in the infant is to perform a genome scan of the mother father affected infant and any unaffected siblings of the affected fetus these analyses will reveal what genetic mutations are present in the affected infant and by comparing these results to the surviving siblings and parents it can be determined which mutations were inherited or were not

V a congenital disorder of glycosylation previously called carbohydratedeficient glycoprotein syndrome is one of several rare inborn errors of metabolism in which glycosylation of a variety of tissue proteins andor lipids is deficient or defective congenital disorders of glycosylation are sometimes known as cdg syndromes they often cause serious sometimes fatal malfunction of several different organ systems especially the nervous system muscles and intestines in affected infants the most common subtype is cdgia also referred to as pmm2cdg where the genetic defect leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2 the enzyme responsible for the conversion of mannose6phosphate into mannose1phosphate   the first cdg patients twin sisters were described in an abstract in the medical journal pediatric research in 1980 by jaeken et al  their main features were psychomotor retardation cerebral and cerebellar atrophy and fluctuating hormone levels egprolactin fsh and gh during the next 15 years the underlying defect remained unknown but since the plasmaprotein transferrin was underglycosylated as shown by eg isoelectric focusing the new syndrome was named carbohydratedeficient glycoprotein syndrome cdgs  its classical phenotype included psychomotor retardation ataxia strabismus anomalies fat pads and inverted nipples and coagulopathy in 1994 a new phenotype was described and named cdgsii  in 1995 van schaftingen and jaeken showed that cdgsi now cdgia or pmm2cdg was caused by the deficiency of the enzyme phosphomannomutase this enzyme is responsible for the interconversion of mannose6phosphate and mannose1phosphate and its deficiency leads to a shortage in gdpmannose and dolichol dolmannose man two donors required for the synthesis of the lipidlinked oligosaccharide precursor of nlinked glycosylation in 1998 niehues et al published a new cdg syndrome cdgib which is caused by mutations in the enzyme metabolically upstream of pmm2 phosphomannose isomerase pmi  in this paper the authors also described a functional therapy for cdgib alimentary mannose the characterization of new defects took up speed and several new type i and type ii defects were delineated  in 2012 need et al published the first case of a congenital disorder of deglycosylation which resulted from mutations in the ngly1 gene  a 2014 study of ngly1 deficient patients found similarities with traditional congenital disorders of glycosylation  historically cdgs are classified as types i and ii cdgi and cdgii depending on the nature and location of the biochemical defect in the metabolic pathway relative to the action of oligosaccharyltransferase the most commonly used screening method for cdg analysis of transferrin glycosylation status by isoelectric focusing esims or other techniques distinguish between these subtypes in so called type i and type ii patterns currently twentytwo cdg typei and fourteen typeii subtypes of cdg have been described  since 2009 most researchers use a different nomenclature based on the gene defect eg cdgia  pmm2cdg cdgib  pmicdg cdgic  alg6cdg etc  the reason for the new nomenclature was the fact that proteins not directly involved in glycan synthesis such as members of the cogfamily  and vesicular hatpase   were found to be causing the glycosylation defect in some cdg patients also defects disturbing other glycosylation pathways than the nlinked one are included in this classification examples are the \u03b1dystroglycanopathies eg pomt1pomt2cdg walkerwarburg syndrome and muscleeyebrain syndrome with deficiencies in omannosylation of proteins oxylosylglycan synthesis defects ext1ext2cdg hereditary multiple exostoses and b4galt7cdg ehlersdanlos syndrome progeroid variant ofucosylglycan synthesis b3galtlcdg peters plus syndrome and lfngcdg spondylocostal dysostosis iii types include types include mutations in several genes have been associated with the traditional clinical syndromes termed muscular dystrophydystroglycanopathies mddg a new nomenclature based on clinical severity and genetic cause was recently proposed by omim  the severity classifications are a severe b intermediate and c mild the subtypes are numbered one to six according to the genetic cause in the following order 1 pomt1 2 pomt2 3 pomgnt1 4 fktn 5 fkrp and 6 large most common severe types include the specific problems produced differ according to the particular abnormal synthesis involved common manifestations include ataxia seizures retinopathy liver fibrosis coagulopathies failure to thrive dysmorphic features eg inverted nipples and subcutaneous fat pads and strabismus if an mri is obtained cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia is a common finding ocular abnormalities of cdgia include myopia infantile esotropia delayed visual maturation low vision optic disc pallor and reduced rod function on electroretinography  three subtypes of cdg i abd can cause congenital hyperinsulinism with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy  a biologically very important group of carbohydrates is the asparagine asnlinked or nlinked oligosaccharides their biosynthetic pathway is very complex and involves a hundred or more glycosyltransferases glycosidases transporters and synthases this plethora allows for the formation of a multitude of different final oligosaccharide structures involved in protein folding intracellular transportlocalization protein activity and degradationhalflife a vast amount of carbohydrate binding molecules lectins depend on correct glycosylation for appropriate binding the selectins involved in leukocyte extravasation is a prime example their binding depends on a correct fucosylation of cell surface glycoproteins lack thereof leads to leukocytosis and increase sensitivity to infections as seen in slc35c1cdgcdgiic caused by a gdpfucose fuc transporter deficiency all nlinked oligosaccharides originate from a common lipidlinked oligosaccharide llo precursor synthesized in the er on a dolicholphosphate dolp anchor the mature llo is transferred cotranslationally to consensus sequence asn residues in the nascent protein and is further modified by trimming and rebuilding in the golgi deficiencies in the genes involved in nlinked glycosylation constitute the molecular background to most of the cdgs the mature llo chain is next transferred to the growing protein chain a process catalysed by the oligosaccharyl transferase ost complex not all structures are fully modified some remain as highmannose structures others as hybrids one unmodified man branch and one modified but the majority become fully modified complex type oligosaccharides in addition to glycosidase i mutations have been found however the use of 100 genes in this process presumably means that many more defects are to be found no treatment is available for most of these disorders mannose supplementation relieves the symptoms in pmicdg cdgib for the most part  even though the hepatic fibrosis may persist  fucose supplementation has had a partial effect on some slc35c1cdg cdgiic or ladii patients

V congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome cbps is a rare neurological disease characterized by paralysis of certain facial muscles and epileptic seizures   signs and symptoms of cbps typically appear in infancy or at birth but can appear later in childhood these include facial diplegia paralysis on both sides facial muscle spasms pseudobulbar palsy dysarthria difficulty speaking difficulty chewing dysphagia difficulty swallowing epilepsy and intellectual disability epileptic seizures in individuals with cbps are different between individuals and can vary between episodes  though the underlying cause of cbps is unknown it is thought to arise from improper migration of neuroblasts neuronal stem cells to the cerebral cortex in the embryonic brain  this causes the layers of the cerebral cortex to not form properly and too many small folds gyri to form on the surface of the brain  this condition is called bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria the sulci deep grooves on the brain may also not form correctly cranial nerves are affected and cause muscle paralysis and spasms in the face and throat  several disorders may appear similar to cbps and need to be distinguished in the process of diagnosing cbps these include pachygyria double cortex syndrome and lissencephaly all of which are classified along with cbps as neuronal migration disorders  diagnostic tests for cbps include electroencephalograms ct scanning and magnetic resonance imaging  cbps is commonly treated with anticonvulsant therapy to reduce seizures therapies include anticonvulsant drugs adrenocorticotropic hormone therapy and surgical therapy including focal corticectomy and callosotomy special education speech therapy and physical therapy are also used to help children with intellectual disability due to cbps  males and females have an equal chance of having cbps

V hypertelorism is an abnormally increased distance between two organs or bodily parts usually referring to an increased distance between the orbits eyes or orbital hypertelorism in this condition the distance between the inner eye corners as well as the distance between the pupils is greater than normal hypertelorism should not be confused with telecanthus in which the distance between the inner eye corners is increased but that of the outer eye corners remains unchanged  therefore the distance between the pupils is normal hypertelorism is a symptom in a variety of syndromes including edwards syndrome trisomy 18 1q211 duplication syndrome basal cell nevus syndrome digeorge syndrome and loeysdietz syndrome hypertelorism can also be seen in apert syndrome craniofrontonasal dysplasia noonan syndrome neurofibromatosis  leopard syndrome crouzon syndrome wolfhirschhorn syndrome andersentawil syndrome waardenburg syndrome and cri du chat syndrome along with piebaldism prominent inner third of the eyebrows irises of different color spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia mucopolysaccharide metabolism disorders morquio syndrome hurlers syndrome deafness and also in hypothyroidism some links have been found between hypertelorism and attention deficithyperactivity disorder   because hypertelorism is an anatomic condition associated with a heterogeneous group of congenital disorders it is believed that the pathological etiology of hypertelorism is also heterogeneous theories include too early ossification of the lower wings of the sphenoid an increased space between the orbita due to increasing width of the ethmoid sinuses field defects during the development a nasal capsule that fails to form leading to a failure in normal medial orbital migration and also a disturbance in the formation of the cranial base which can be seen in syndromes like apert and crouzon  the surgery to correct hypertelorism is usually done between 5 and 8 years of age this addresses the psychosocial aspects in the childs early school years another reason for correction age 5 or older is that the surgery should be delayed until the tooth buds have grown out low enough into the maxilla thus preventing damage to them also before age 5 the craniofacial bones are thin and fragile which can make surgical correction difficult in addition it is possible that orbital surgery during infancy may inhibit midface growth  for the treatment of hypertelorism there are 2 main operative options the box osteotomy and the facial bipartition also referred to as median fasciotomy  this treatment of orbital hypertelorism was first performed by paul tessier  the surgery starts off by various osteotomies that separate the entire bony part of the orbit from the skull and surrounding facial bones one of the osteotomies consists of removing the bone between the orbits the orbits are then mobilized and brought towards each other because this often creates excessive skin between the orbits a midline excision of skin is frequently necessary this approximates the eyebrows and eye corners and provides a more pleasing look  the standard procedure box osteotomy was modified by jacques van der meulen and resulted in the development of the facial bipartitionor median faciotomy   facial bipartition first involves splitting the frontal bone from the supraorbital rim then the orbits and the midface are released from the skullbase using monoblock osteotomy then a triangular shaped piece of bone is removed from the midline of the midface the base of this triangular segment lies above the orbita and the apex lies between the upper incisor teeth after removing this segment it is possible to rotate the two halves of the midface towards each other thus resulting in reduction of the distance between the orbits it also results in leveling out the vshaped maxilla and therefore widening of it because hypertelorism is often associated with syndromes like apert hypertelorism is often seen in combination with midface dysplasia if this is the case facial bipartition can be combined with distraction osteogenesis the aim of distraction osteogenesis of the midface is to normalize the relationship between orbital rim to eye and also normalize the position of zygomas nose and maxilla in relation to the mandible  to create an acceptable aesthetic result in the correction of orbital hypertelorism it is also important to take softtissue reconstruction in consideration in this context correction of the nasal deformities is one of the more difficult procedures bone and cartilage grafts may be necessary to create a nasal frame and local rotation with for example forehead flaps or advancement flaps can be used to cover the nose  as with almost every kind of surgery the main complications in both treatments of hypertelorism include excessive bleeding risk of infection and csf leaks and dural fistulas infections and leaks can be prevented by giving perioperative antibiotics and identifying and closing of any dural tears the risk of significant bleeding can be prevented by meticulous technique and blood loss is compensated by transfusions blood loss can also be reduced by giving hypotensive anesthesia rarely major eye injuries including blindness are seen visual disturbances can occur due to the eye muscle imbalance after orbital mobilization ptosis and diplopia can also occur postoperatively but this usually selfcorrects a quite difficult problem to correct postoperatively is canthal drift which can be managed best by carefully preserving the canthal tendon attachments as much as possible despite the extensiveness in these procedures mortality is rarely seen in operative correction of hypertelorism  diagnostic and statistical manual of

latin ending also known as craniofacial duplication cranio from greek \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd skull the other parts latin is an extremely rare congenital disorder whereby parts accessories or all of the face are duplicated on the head         although classically considered conjoined twinning which it resembles this anomaly is not normally due to the fusion or incomplete separation of two embryos it is the result of abnormal activity by the protein shh sonic hedgehog    the name of this protein was inspired by the sonic the hedgehog video game character and is part of an idiosyncratic naming tradition in molecular biology research   shh and its corresponding gene have been found to play an important role in signaling craniofacial patterning during embryonic development among other things shh governs the width of facial features in excess it leads to widening of facial features and to duplication of facial structures  the greater the widening the more structures are duplicated often in a mirror image form this has been demonstrated in the laboratory by introducing pellets of the shh protein into chicken embryos resulting in chickens with duplicate beaks inadequate amounts of that protein lead to opposite conditions such as cyclopia where facial features are insufficiently developed  healthy brain development is also dependent on the signaling function of shh  during embryonic development shh directs embryonic cells to organize in specific areas that later become specialized neural tissues thus controlling the size and shape of brain structures diprosopus often occurs in combination with other congenital disorders particularly anencephaly neural tube defect and cardiac malformations  when present the brain may show abnormalities ranging from partial to complete duplication of brain structures andor underdevelopment of brain tissues   few twofaced animals have survived due to associated internal organ abnormalities and brain abnormalities one of the most famous was ditto a pig  ditto was raised to adulthood but died of pneumonia caused by food inhalation when breathing through one muzzle while eating with the other cats with the condition are known as janus cats after the roman god  in july 2006 a 6yearold male janus cat called frank and louie from millbury massachusetts usa received publicity in his case only one esophagus and possibly only one trachea was functional and aided survival in september 2011 when frank and louie was 12 years old it was announced that he will appear in the 2012 guinness book of world records as the longestsurviving janus cat on record  in 2014 frank and louie died at the age of 15  most human infants with diprosopus are stillborn known instances of humans with diprosopus surviving for longer than minutes to hours past birth are very rare only a few are recorded in 2002 and 2003 two living male infants with partial diprosopus were described in the medical literature in separate case reports   one infant was born with duplication of the nose and the cerebral frontal lobes two widely spaced eyes a small underdeveloped central eye socket and a large asymmetric mouth the other infant was born with duplication of the upper and lower jaw two tongues ending in the same base cleft palate a slightly divided tip of the nose and two widely spaced eyes as well as absence of the corpus callosum duplication of the pituitary gland and stalk and abnormalities in the midbrain because they were born with a milder partial form of diprosopus both infants were considered candidates for surgical correction of their abnormal facial features lali singh  was born march 10 2008 to sushma and vinod singh in saini sunpura sohanpur village near delhi the birth was delayed by dystocia caused by her large head and her birth in a hospital was facilitated by her mothers receiving an episiotomy she was one of the very few infants with diprosopus to survive well past birth she might have been the only known living individual with complete facial duplication her facial features included two pairs of eyes two noses and two mouths but only one pair of ears she was seen as the reincarnation of the goddess durga who has three eyes and is also an incarnation of the hindu god ganesh sushma and vinod singh declined an offer from local doctors to evaluate their daughter through ct or mri scanning without diagnostic imaging it was not possible to know the full extent to which the childs condition might have affected her brain and other vital structures in her head and neck thus any estimation of her ability to survive or even thrive could be only speculative though lalis family described her as functioning normally it is also unknown whether neurosurgeons or craniofacial surgeons if consulted would have had feasible solutions to offer with respect to corrective surgery a local doctor told reporters that the baby should be considered a healthy child who currently was living a normal life a previously unknown occurrence among sufferers of the disorder  lalis two middle eyes suffered from corneal opacity due to abnormal anatomy of the facial muscles which prevented her from properly closing those eyes before it was wrongly blamed on camera flashes a cleft palate caused difficulty feeding her under village conditions a poor diet of bottlefed sugar solution and diluted milk allowed to drip down her throat as she could not suck properly because of the cleft palate weakened her condition and vomiting and infection started admission to hospital was delayed by discussion including taking her back home from hospital among her extended family and her villages headman finally her parents alarmed at her illness and dehydration defied her other relatives and took her back to hospital where under proper medical treatment including antibiotic and a saline drip she started to improve stopped vomiting started drinking milk and defecating normally but 6 hours later at two months old to the day she died of a heart attack  she was buried in her village as is usual in hinduism with children who die very young later a temple was built at the village in her memory faith daisy and hope alice howie  may 8 2014  may 27 2014  were born in sydney australia to parents simon howie and renee young faith and hope shared one body and skull but had complete duplication of the facial features as well as duplication of the brain both brains joined to one brain stem young and howie had learned at 19 weeks gestation of their childrens condition but opted not to terminate the pregnancy the children were born 6 weeks prematurely and appeared to be doing well able to breathe unaided several days after their birth and they were observed to sleep and cry at different times  they died 19 days following their birth due to unknown causes although some sources indicated that the girls died following an operation for unknown reasons

V a branchial cleft cyst is a congenital epithelial cyst that arises on the lateral part of the neck due to failure of obliteration of the second branchial cleft or failure of fusion of the second and third branchial arches in embryonic development   the cyst wall is composed of either squamous or columnar cells with lymphoid infiltrate often with prominent germinal centers the cyst may contain granular and keratinaceous cellular debris cholesterol crystals may be found in the fluid extracted from a branchial cyst branchial cleft cysts are remnants of embryonic development and result from a failure of obliteration of one of the branchial clefts which in fish develop into gills   most branchial cleft fistulae are asymptomatic but they may become infected the cyst however usually presents as a smooth slowly enlarging lateral neck mass that may increase in size after an upper respiratory tract infection  conservative ie no treatment or surgical excision as complete surgical excision may be difficult due to the close proximity of the internal jugular vein and carotid vessels that lie deep to the swelling they can recur

V fetus in fetu or foetus in foetu is a developmental abnormality in which a mass of tissue resembling a fetus forms inside the body there are two theories of origin concerning fetus in fetu one theory is that the mass begins as a normal fetus but becomes enveloped inside its twin  the other theory is that the mass is a highly developed teratoma fetus in fetu is estimated to occur in 1 in 500000 live births    a fetus in fetu can be considered alive but only in the sense that its component tissues have not yet died or been eliminated thus the life of a fetus in fetu is akin to that of a tumor in that its cells remain viable by way of normal metabolic activity however without the gestational conditions in utero with the amnion and placenta a fetus in fetu can develop into at best an especially well differentiated teratoma or at worst a highgrade metastatic teratocarcinoma in terms of physical maturation its organs have a working blood supply from the host but all cases of fetus in fetu present critical defects such as no functional brain heart lungs gastrointestinal tract or urinary tract accordingly while a fetus in fetu can share select morphological features with a normal fetus it has no prospect of any life outside of the host twin moreover it poses clear threats to the life of the host twin on whom its own life depends  there are two main theories about the development of fetus in fetu fetus in fetu may be a very highly differentiated form of dermoid cyst itself a highly differentiated form of mature teratoma  fetus in fetu may be a parasitic twin fetus growing within its host twin very early in a monozygotic twin pregnancy in which both fetuses share a common placenta one fetus wraps around and envelops the other the enveloped twin becomes a parasite in that their survival depends on the survival of their host twin by drawing on the host twins blood supply the parasitic twin is anencephalic without a brain and lacks some internal organs and as such is unable to survive on its own as the host twin has to feed the enveloped twin from the nutrients received over a single umbilical cord they usually die before birth  an early example of the phenomenon was described in 1808 by george william young   cases of fetus in fetu sometimes attract worldwide media attention these cases are a small minority of the known cases and rarely overlap with cases reported in the medical literature but they are widely accessible

V an accessory auricle is considered a developmental anomaly resulting from the persistence of a structure which variably recapitulates the normal external ear   there may be several components or degrees of development ranging from an ear tag preauricular appendage preauricular tag accessory tragus to supernumerary ears or polyotia   it is a relatively common congenital anomaly of the first branchial arch or second branchial arches other anomalies may be present concurrently including cleft palate cleft lip or mandibular hypoplasia there is a known association with goldenhar syndrome oculoauriculovertebral syndrome  and with wildervanck syndrome    there may also be an association with congenital cartilaginous rest of the neck the general presentation is of a skincovered nodule papule or nodule of the skin surface usually immediately anterior to the auricle however it may be anywhere within the periauricular tissues bilateral presentation can be seen      the lesions presents as a nodule or papule either sessile or pedunculated they may be soft or have a cartilaginous structure by histologic examination it is a recapitulation of normal external auricle there will be skin cartilaginous structures and cartilage although the later is not seen in all variants of this disorder   some investigators believe that the tragus is the only hillock which is derived from the first branchial arch this is clearly suggestive that true cases of accessory auricle represent a true duplication of the hillocks that were part of the second branchial arch  the second ear appears as a mirror image folded forward and lying on the posterior cheek these structures are distinctly different from squamous papilloma and benign teratoma simple surgical excision is curative  the recommended treatment is that the skin is peeled off the extraauricular tissue and protruding cartilage remnants are trimmed  normal appearance is achieved in majority of cases the reconstruction successful in true cases of accessory auricle as it also is in individuals with auricular appendages   these lesions usually present in neonates although they may not come to clinical attention until adulthood for cosmetic reasons there is no gender predilection they are present in approximately 36 per 1000 live births  lester d r thompson bruce m wenig 2011 diagnostic pathology head and neck published by amirsys hagerstown md lippincott williams  wilkins pp723 isbn1931884617

V simpsongolabibehmel syndrome sgbs also called bulldog syndrome sara agers syndrome golabirosen syndrome simpson dysmorphia syndrome sdys or xlinked dysplasia gigantism syndrome dgsx  is a rare inherited congenital disorder that can cause craniofacial skeletal cardiac and renal abnormalities the syndrome is inherited in an xlinked recessive fashion  where males express the phenotype and females usually do not females that possess one copy of the mutation are considered to be carriers of the syndrome and may express varying degrees of the phenotype there are two types of sgbs each found on a different gene sgbs is also considered to be an overgrowth syndrome ogs ogs is characterized by a 23 standard deviation increase in weight height or head circumference above the average for sex and age one of the most noted features of ogs is the increased risk of neoplasms in certain ogss sgbs in particular has been found to have a 10 tumor predisposition frequency with 94 of cases occurring in the abdominal region most being malignant it is common for tumors to be embryonal in type and appear before the age of 10 there are five different types of tumors that patients with sgbs might develop all intraabdominal wilms tumor hepatoblastoma hepatocarcinoma gonadoblastoma and neuroblastoma the most common types of tumors developed in patients are the wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma    although not all causes of sgbs have been identified one cause of sgbs type i is a mutation of the glypican3 gene gpc3 on the x chromosome locus q261 this particular gene is widely expressed especially in tissues derived from the mesoderm during fetal development the function of this gene is to produce a protein that acts as a cell surface receptor that binds to transcription factors binding of the transcription factors allows regulation of cellular responses to growth factors such as members of the hedgehog protein family when large or small deletions and missense mutations occur along the gpc3 gene gpc3 can no longer negatively regulate hedgehog signaling during development therefore increasing cell proliferation and the risk of developing cancer  limb patterning and skeletal development may also go awry when gcp3 mutations inhibit regulations of responses to bone morphogenetic proteins another type of growth factor  it has been suggested that sgbs type ii may be caused by duplication of the gpc4 gene which helps to regulate cell division and growth  also some patients diagnosed with sgbs do not have any gpc3 or gpc4 deletions or mutations possible explanations include promoter mutation or silencing of the gpc3 gene causing reduced expression in these patients  the disorder is passed on in an xlinked recessive fashion detection usually begins with a routine doctor visit when the fundal height is being measured or during an ultrasound examination when large for gestational age fetuses lga are identified there may be a possibility of two causes maternal diabetes or incorrect dates however if these two causes are ruled out an ultrasound is performed to detect for overgrowth and other abnormalities at this point it becomes essential for a clinical geneticist to assist in the correct selection of tests and possible diagnosis  first signs of sgbs may be observed as early as 16 weeks of gestation aids to diagnosing might include the presence of macrosomia polyhydramnios elevated maternal serum\u03b1fetoprotein cystic hygroma hydrops fetalis increased nuchal translucency craniofacial abnormalities visceromegaly renal abnormalities congenital diaphragmatic hernia polydactyly and a single umbilical artery  if there is a known mutation in the family prenatal testing is available prenatal testing is also possible by looking for evidence of the mild sgbs phenotype in the mother and the positive sgbs phenotype in male family members family members who are positive of sgbs may undergo mutational analysis of genes gcp3 gcp4 and cxorf5 genomic balance in xp22 and xq26 may also be analyzed through array comparative genomic hybridization  due to the high percentage of male deaths during the neonatal period early detection of tumors is crucial in order to detect the presence of tumors screening in sgbs patients should include abdominal ultrasound urinalysis and biochemical markers that screen for embryonic tumors  once the infant is born possibility of hypoglycemia must be assessed along with cardiac genitalia liver and adrenal evaluations such tests include chest radiographs electrocardiogram echocardiogram renal sonography and abdominal sonography to test for possible abnormalities  since the syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation in the individuals dna a cure is not available treatment of the symptoms and management of the syndrome however is possible depending on the manifestation surgery increased intake of glucose special education occupational therapy speech therapy and physical therapy are some methods of managing the syndrome and associated symptoms  sgbs is similar to another overgrowth syndrome called beckwithwiedemann syndrome sgbs cells are a unique tool to study the function of human adipocyte biology these cells are similar to human primary preadipocytes and will become a popular model instead of mouse 3t3l1 cells to study the secretion and adipokine pro\ufb01le in the future this cellular tool has been described and developed by dr martin wabitsch university of ulm germany

V pectus excavatum a latin term meaning hollowed chest  is the most common congenital deformity of the anterior wall of the chest in which several ribs and the sternum grow abnormally this produces a cavedin or sunken appearance of the chest  it can either be present at birth or not develop until puberty pectus excavatum is sometimes considered to be cosmetic however depending on the severity it can impair cardiac and respiratory function and cause pain in the chest and back  people with the condition may experience negative psychosocial effects and avoid activities that expose the chest  pectus excavatum is sometimes referred to as cobblers chest sunken chest the crevasse or funnel chest   the hallmark of the condition is a sunken appearance of the sternum the heart can be displaced andor rotated mitral valve prolapse may also be present physical capability may be limited due to base lung capacity being decreased  researchers are currently unsure as to the actual cause of pectus excavatum but hypothesize genetic defect   approximately 37 of individuals with pectus excavatum have a first degree family member with the condition  physiologically increased pressure in utero rickets and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms  pectus excavatum is also a relatively common symptom of marfan syndrome  and loeysdietz syndrome and sometimes is found in other connective tissue disorders such as ehlersdanlos syndrome  many children with spinal muscular atrophy develop pectus excavatum due to the diaphragmatic breathing that is common with the disease pectus excavatum also occurs in about 1 of persons diagnosed with celiac disease for unknown reasons  because the heart is located behind the sternum and because individuals with pectus excavatum have been shown to have visible deformities of the heart seen both on radiological imaging and after autopsies it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with pectus excavatum while some studies have demonstrated decreased cardiovascular function in pectus excavatum there has been no consensus reached based on newer physiological tests such as echocardiography of the presence or degree of impairment in cardiovascular function in people with pectus excavatum similarly there is no consensus on the degree of functional improvement after corrective surgery  pectus excavatum is initially suspected from visual examination of the anterior chest auscultation of the chest can reveal displaced heart beat and valve prolapse there can be a heart murmur occurring during systole caused by proximity between the sternum and the pulmonary artery  lung sounds are usually clear yet diminished due to decreased base lung capacity  many scales have been developed to determine the degree of deformity in the chest wall most of these are variants on the distance between the sternum and the spine one such index is the backer ratio which grades severity of deformity based on the ratio between the diameter of the vertebral body nearest to xiphosternal junction and the distance between the xiphosternal junction and the nearest vertebral body  more recently the haller index has been used based on ct scan measurements an index over 325 is often defined as severe  the haller index is the ratio between the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage and the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum  chest xrays are also useful in the diagnosis the chest xray in pectus excavatum can show an opacity in the right lung area that can be mistaken for an infiltrate such as that seen with pneumonia  some studies also suggest that the haller index can be calculated based on chest xray as opposed to ct scanning in individuals who have no limitation in their function  pectus excavatum is differentiated from other disorders by a series of elimination of signs and symptoms pectus carinatum is excluded by the simple observation of a collapsing of the sternum rather than a protrusion kyphoscoliosis is excluded by diagnostic imaging of the spine where in pectus excavatum the spine usually appears normal in structure treatment for pectus excavatum can involve either invasive or noninvasive techniques or a combination of both before an operation proceeds several tests are usually to be performed these include but are not limited to a ct scan pulmonary function tests and cardiology exams such as auscultation and ecgs  after a ct scan is taken the haller index is measured the patients haller is calculated by obtaining the ratio of the transverse diameter the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage and the anteroposterior diameter the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum  a haller index of greater than 325 is generally considered severe while normal chest has an index of 25    the cardiopulmonary tests are used to determine the lung capacity and to check for heart murmurs the implant allows pectus excavatum to be treated from a purely morphological perspective today it is used as a benchmark procedure as it is simple reliable minimally intrusive and without any risk of injury or complications while offering aestheticallypleasing results  this procedure does not however claim to correct existing cardiac and respiratory problems which in very rare cases can be triggered by the pectus excavatum condition for female sufferers the potential resulting breast asymmetry can be partially or completely corrected by this procedure  the process of creating a plastercast model directly on the skin of the patients thorax can be used in the design of the implants however the evolution of medical imaging and cad computeraided design  now allows customised 3d implants to be designed directly from the ribcage therefore being much more precise easier to place subpectorally and perfectly adapted to the shape of each patient  the implants are made of medical silicon rubber which is ageresistant and unbreakable different to the silicon gel used in breast implants they will last for life apart from the rare case of an adverse reaction and are not visible externally the surgery is performed under general anesthesia and takes an hour a single procedure where no material is removed the surgeon makes an incision of approximately seven centimetres prepares the customised space in the chest inserts the implant deep beneath the muscle then closes the incision in three steps without draining hospitalization is 3 days maximum the recovery after the surgery is not very painful and only requires mild pain relief postoperative care is minimal a dressing is required for eight days and compression vest for a month following the procedure a checkup appointment is carried out after eight days for puncture of seroma the patient can resume normal activities relatively quickly  he can return to work after 15 days and participate in any sporting activities after three months the lipofilling technique consists of sucking fat from the patient using a syringe with a large gauge needle usually from the abdomen or the outer thighs then after centrifugation the fat cells are reinjected beneath the skin into whichever hollow it is needed to fill this technique is primarily used to correct small defects which may persist after conventional surgical treatment surgical correction has been shown to repair any functional symptoms that may occur in the condition such as respiratory problems or heart murmurs provided that permanent damage has not already arisen from an extremely severe case  one of the most popular technique for repair of pectus excavatum today is the minimally invasive operation also known as mirpe or nuss technique  the ravitch technique is an invasive surgery that was introduced in 1949  and developed in the 1950s to treat the condition this procedure involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached a small bar is then inserted underneath the sternum to hold it up in the desired position the bar is left implanted until the cartilage grows back typically about 6 months the bar is subsequently removed in a simple outpatient procedure the ravitch technique is not widely practiced because it is so invasive it is often used in older patients where the sternum has calcified when the deformity is asymmetrical or when the less invasive nuss procedure has proven unsuccessful  the ravitch procedure is a twostage procedure two surgeries some months apart dr donald nuss based at childrens hospital of the kings daughters in norfolk virginia developed in 1987  a technique that is minimally invasive   the nuss procedure involves slipping in one or more concave steel bars into the chest underneath the sternum the bar is flipped to a convex position so as to push outward on the sternum correcting the deformity the bar usually stays in the body for about two years although many surgeons are now moving toward leaving them in for up to five years when the bones have solidified into place the bar is removed through outpatient surgery although initially designed to be performed in younger patients less than 10 years of age whose sternum and cartilage is more flexible there are successful series of nuss treatment in patients well into their teens and twenties the nuss procedure is a twostage procedure two surgeries some years apart dr francis robicsek based at carolinas healthcare system in charlotte nc developed the robicsek procedure in 1965 each time the procedure is performed it is individually tailored based on the extent and location of the deformity in the patient the operation begins with an incision no more than 46 centimeters to the sternum the pectoralis major muscles are then detached from the sternum using the upper limit of the sternal depression as a guide the deformed cartilages are removed onebyone using sharp and blunt dissection the lower tip of the sternum is then grabbed with a towelclip and using blunt dissection is freed of tissue connections with the pericardium and the pleura the sternum is then forcefully bent forward into a corrected position the robicsek procedure is a singlestage procedure one surgery only to keep the sternum elevated a piece of mesh is placed under the mobilized sternum and sutured under moderate tension bilaterally to the stumps of the ribs after appropriate hemostasis the pectoralis muscles are united in front of the sternum and the wound is closed without additional drainage any pressuredressing should be avoided   the purported advantage of this technique is that it is less invasive than the ravitch technique but critics have suggested that the relapse rate may be high due to cartilage and bone displaying memory phenomenon there has been controversy as to the best surgical approach for correction of pectus excavatum it is important for the surgeon to select the appropriate operative approach based on each individual patients characteristics  the magnetic minimover procedure 3mp is a technique used to correct pectus excavatum by using two magnets to realign the sternum with the rest of the chest and ribcage  one magnet is inserted 1cm into the patients body on the lower end of the sternum the other is placed externally onto a custom fitted brace these two magnets generate around 004tesla t in order to slowly move the sternum outwards over a number of years the maximum magnetic field that can be applied to the body safely is around 4t making this technique safe from a magnetic viewpoint  the 3mp techniques main advantages are that it is more costeffective than major surgical approaches such as the nuss procedure and it is considerably less painful postoperatively its effectiveness is limited to younger children in early to midpuberty because older patients have less compliant flexible chest walls  one potential adverse interaction with other medical devices is possible inactivation of artificial pacemakers if present a relatively new alternative to surgery is the vacuum bell it consists of a bowl shaped device which fits over the cavedin area the air is then removed by the use of a hand pump  the vacuum created by this lifts the sternum upwards lessening the severity of the deformity  once the defect visually disappears two additional years of use of the vacuum bell is required to make what may be a permanent correction   mild cases have also reportedly been treated with corsetlike orthopedic support vests and exercise   pectus excavatum occurs in an estimated 1 in 1501000 births with male predominance maletofemale ratio of 31 occurrences of the condition in family members have been reported in 35 to 45 of cases   leonardo da vinci may have depicted pectus excavatum  pectus excavatum is also known to occur in animals eg the munchkin breed of cat  some procedures used to treat the condition in animals have not been used in human treatments such as the use of a cast with sutures wrapped around the sternum and the use of internal and external splints   these techniques are generally used in immature animals with flexible cartilage

V a monster is any creature usually found in legends or horror fiction that is often hideous and may produce fear or physical harm by its appearance andor its actions the word monster derives from latin monstrum an aberrant occurrence usually biological that was taken as a sign that something was wrong within the natural order  the word usually connotes something wrong or evil a monster is generally morally objectionable physically or psychologically hideous andor a freak of nature it can also be applied figuratively to a person with similar characteristics like a greedy person or a person who does horrible things the root of monstrum is monerewhich does not only mean to warn but also to instruct and forms the basis of the modern english demonstrate thus the monster is also a sign or instruction this benign interpretation was proposed by saint augustine who did not see the monster as inherently evil but as part of the natural design of the world a kindof deliberate category error    among newborn young and embryos of humans and most species of animals are found occasional individuals who are malformed in whole or in part cf teratology the most grossly abnormal of these have been referred to from ancient times as monsters probably because the birth of one was thought to signify something monstrous or portentous while the less severe are known as abnormalities or anomalies or even birth defects no sharp line separates these grades of malformation all being due to various kinds and degrees of modification of the normal course of development of the embryo the study of these deviations forms the subject of teratology a branch of morphology or embryology  a knowledge of the kinds of abnormalities and their causes may like deliberate experiments increase understanding of normal development convention recognizes two major classes of monsters those that represent defective or excessive growth in a single body and those that have partial or complete doubling of the body or one of its axes classic monsters spawn from legends and fictional stories well known monsters include dracula frankensteins creation wolfman the mummy the invisible man and zombies to name a few giants and dwarfs are often classed as monsters probably because of the prominent places they occupy in mythology since in humans they generally result from abnormal growth they cannot usually be recognised as abnormal at birth an exception is the disproportionate dwarfism known as achondroplasia or chondrodystrophia in which the limbs and especially the legs are short thick and bent with head and trunk disproportionately large this congenital abnormality occurs in many animals including a similar abnormality has become a breed characteristic in bulldogs in all these cases abnormal characteristics are inherited together cases where this type of dwarfism in a human family behaves as a simple hereditary characteristic have been reported  it may also be due to other causes rudolf virchow long ago noted the familial association of the chondrodystrophic type of monster with another type in which the limbs except for digits are nearly absent phocomelus it has since been shown by walter landauer  that the fowl phocomelus and chondrodystrophia result from the same hereditary factor the former representing the homozygote the latter the heterozygote gigantism usually expresses itself during early growth in humans it often arises from endocrine imbalance it may declare itself at birth in greater size and sometimes in lower animals and plants is due to the doubling of the normal chromosome number cf heredity and tetraploidy repetition or deficiency of single parts such as fingers or toes polydactyly hypodactyly are frequent anomalies in humans and other mammals absence or abnormality of whole limbs is less common and includes besides clubfoot the socalled congenital amputations once thought due to strangulation of a limb by a fold of embryonic membrane amnion it is probable that endogenous abnormalities of the bone are more frequent causes of such amputations than are strangulations cases are recorded of human identical twins in which both members have the same type of limb abnormality suggesting an hereditary predisposition to this type of malformation in other cases injury and malposition are probably responsible  in addition to monsters with rudimentary limbs phocomelus others are known with incomplete or underdeveloped extremities hemimelus micromelus ectromelus a rare type of monster that has always attracted interest has the lower extremities more or less united as in mammals of the order sirenia such as the dugong or manatee and in the mythical figures of sirens or mermaids such sirenoid monsters may have a single foot uromelus or limbs fused throughout their length with no separate feet sirenomelus or symelus defective closure of lines of junction in the embryo produces monstrosities such as harelip and cleft palate in which the ventral laminae of the palate have failed to fuse a frequent abnormality in human infants is spina bifida in which the spine fails to close over leaving a gap in the vertebral column both conditions are inherited albeit somewhat irregularly in humans hydrocephalus is a related abnormality in which the embryonic spaces of the brain persist and fill with fluid causing a greatly distended brain and head a hereditary form appears in mice occasional monsters are found in which a part of the brain protrudes through the cranium as an encephalocoele an extreme along this line is reached in pseudoencephaly in which the whole brain is everted and rests upon the top of the cranium like a wig  hermaphrodites as individuals containing both functional testes and ovaries do not occur in mammals including humans where sex is determined in the fertilised egg and is fundamentally distinct at birth intersexual offspring occur in which the sexual organs undergo some developments in the direction of those of the opposite sex minor anomalies of genitalia such as hypospadias are relatively frequent  a remarkable feature of monsters in vertebrates including humans is the association of multiple abnormalities in complex syndromes thus in humans harelip spina bifida hydrocephalus and polydactyly may be found in the same monster while in acrocephalosyndactyly we find an egg or domeshaped skull partial or complete fusion of digits in both hands and feet and often in addition harelip contractures spina bifida and mental abnormality several authors have suggested that such multiple abnormalities trace to a common source in a retardation in early development which in the above case is probably due to a defective gene  much has been learned from study of abnormalities that occur in graded series thus geneticists sewall wright and k wagner showed that an extensive series of monsters in one inbred family of guinea pigs could be arranged in a series in which those with least defect are normal except for a single median lower incisor while with increasing grade of defect the lower jaw is reduced and lost agnathia the ears approach each other on the ventral side and fuse otocephaly leaving a single ear aperture in the throat then the mouth and upper teeth are reduced the nostrils formed into a proboscis the eyes are reduced microphthalmia and fused in the centre of the forehead cyclopia and finally all head structures are lost except a small median ear acraniate monster  the primary factor in these cases is abnormal heredity combined with a chance assortment of minor environmental factors to produce varying inhibition at different times in early development when the antecedents of the head form otocephaly cyclopia and related defects have been produced in experimental animals fish and amphibian embryos by chemical treatments that inhibit in ways the head is especially sensitive to monsters falling in similar series are found in humans and other vertebrates they probably arise as a result of interaction between a specific heredity and abnormalities in the environment of the embryo sometimes due to disease or injury individuals partially or wholly double but joined together are represented by the rare occurrence in humans of siamese twins which also reveal the mode of origin of this type of monster siamese twins socalled from a famous pair exhibited for many years in the 19th century are identical twins joined by a bridge of tissue that joins the circulatory systems they probably arise by the nearly complete separation of a single fertilised egg into two parts german embryologist hans spemann produced double monsters in newts experimentally by constricting the egg in the two cell stage with a hairloop human identical twins arise by complete separation of the two halves of one embryo at a very early stage and thus represent an extreme of the same process that causes double monsters   in humans partially double symmetrical monsters occur these vary from those with a single head but neck trunk and limbs doubled through those with two heads and a single trunk to others with head shoulders and arms doubled but with one trunk and one pair of legs such double monsters probably arise following the less complete separation of the halves of the early embryo or partial separation at later stages a rare type is one in which there is a janus head two faces on a single head and body janus monsters have been produced experimentally by a variety of treatments of amphibian embryos in early stages a group of cases in which the hinder end of the body was doubled from the sacrum back has been found in one strain of mice and appears to be due to abnormal heredity doubling of whole limbs in amphibia has been produced experimentally by injuring the limb rudiment at an early sensitive stage  unequal double monsters consist of two partsone usually well formed and the other small vestigial or abnormal that seems like a parasite upon the more normal partner thus a young man of genoa lazarus colloredo born in 1716 who was figured as a child by fortunias licetus and later by danish physician caspar thomeson bartholinus bore at the lower end of his breast bone a living child as parasite in other cases the parasite is attached in the head region or to the trunk the parasite often shows the same types of monstrosities which in single monsters have been attributed to delayed development rarely the parasite is included within the abdominal cavity of the larger partner as a foetus in foetu  the origin of double monsters has been traced to a variety of causes including disease of mother or embryo faulty placentation in humans and other mammals and other factors which reduce the oxygen supply or nutrition of the embryo the most thoroughgoing application of the latter idea has been made by charles r stockard who produced double monsters of many types as well as single monsters by subjecting eggs and early embryos of fish to a variety of stimuli low temperature poisons etc he concluded that the primary action of all the treatments is to inhibit the rate of development and the type of deformity that results depends simply upon the developmental moment at which the interruption occurs  aforementioned wright and wagner showed in addition that some of the factors determining the inhibition are internal that is part of the heredity of the embryo in general for double as for single monsters it is probably true to conclude that most of them are due to modifications of normal development during critical periods of embryonic life  monsters have been regarded by primitive peoples as of supernatural origin human monsters have been attributed to intercourse between women and the devil or between men and animals many mythical beings such as races of dwarfs and giants cyclops with a single eye sirens mermaids races of men with a single median leg  were probably suggested by actual observations of human monsters the scientific study of monsters began with william harvey 1651 who attributed them to deviations from the normal course of embryonic development the present system of classification of monsters was introduced by isidore geoffroy sainthilaire whose great work on anomalies paris 18321837 remains a valuable source of information   ancient grecoroman celtic semitic norse chinese and sumerian folklore all had a wealth of legendary beasts classical mythology is a catalog of indescribable horrors with all sorts of monsters populating a world of cruelty and evil folklore created a fantastic dimension dominated by strange forces and terrifying creatures foul because the latter were hybrids that violated the laws of natural forms during the age of silent movies monsters tended to be humansized eg frankensteins monster the golem werewolves and vampires the film siegfried featured a dragon that was actually a giant puppet on tracks a few movie dinosaurs were created with the use of stopmotion animated models as in rkos king kong the first giant monster film of the sound era universal studios specialized in monsters with bela lugosis reprisal of his stage role dracula and boris karloff playing frankensteins monster the studio also made several lesser films such as manmade monster starring lon chaney jr as a carnival side show worker who is turned into an electrically charged killer who dispatches victims merely by touching them causing death by electrocution there was also a variant of dr frankenstein the mad surgeon dr gogol played by peter lorre who transplanted hands that were reanimated with malevolent temperaments in the film mad love werewolves were introduced in films during this period and similar creatures were presented in cat people mummies were cinematically depicted as fearsome monsters as well as for giant creatures the cliffhanger of the first episode of the 1936 flash gordon serial did not use a costumed actor instead using reallife lizards to depict a pair of battling dragons via use of camera perspective however the cliffhanger of the ninth episode of the same serial had a man in a rubber suit play the fire dragon which picks up a doll representing flash in its claws the cinematic monster cycle eventually wore thin having a comedic turn in abbott and costello meet frankenstein 1948 in the post world war ii era however giant monsters returned to the screen with a vigor that has been causally linked to the development of nuclear weapons one early example occurred in the american film the beast from 20000 fathoms which was about a dinosaur that attacked a lighthouse subsequently there were japanese film depictions godzilla gamera british depictions gorgo and even danish depictions reptilicus of giant monsters attacking cities a recent depiction of a giant monster is the monster in j j abramss cloverfield which was released in theaters january 18 2008 the intriguing proximity of other planets brought the notion of extraterrestrial monsters to the big screen some of which were huge in size such as king ghidorah and gigan while others were of a more human scale during this period the fishman monster gillman was developed in the film series creature from the black lagoon britains hammer film productions brought colour to the monster movies in the late 1950s around this time the earlier universal films were usually shown on american television by independent stations rather than network stations by using announcers with strange personas who gained legions of young fans although they have since changed considerably movie monsters did not entirely disappear from the big screen as they did in the late 1940s occasionally monsters are depicted as friendly or misunderstood creatures king kong and frankensteins monster are two examples of misunderstood creatures frankensteins monster is frequently depicted in this manner in films such as monster squad and van helsing the hulk is an example of the monster as hero archetype the theme of the friendly monster is pervasive in popculture chewbacca elmo and shrek are notable examples of friendly monsters the creatures of monsters inc scare children in order to create energy for running machinery while the furry monsters of the muppets and sesame street live in harmony with animals and humans alike japanese culture also commonly features monsters which are benevolent andor likeable with the most famous examples being the pokémon franchise and the pioneering anime my neighbor totoro the book serieswebisodestoy line of monster high is another example monsters are a staple of fantasy fiction horror fiction or science fiction where the monsters are often extraterrestrial in nature there is also a burgeoning subgenre of erotic fiction involving monsters monster erotica monsters are commonly encountered in fantasy or roleplaying games and video games as enemies for players to fight against they may include aliens legendary creatures extradimensional entities or mutated versions of regular animals especially in roleplaying games monster is a catchall term for hostile characters that are fought by the player sentient fictional races are usually not referred to as monsters at other times the term can carry a neutral connotation such as in the pokémon franchise where it is used to refer to fictional creatures that resemble realworld animals characters in games may refer to all animals as monsters monsters in legend monsters in fiction

V johansonblizzard syndrome jbs is a rare sometimes fatal autosomal recessive multisystem congenital disorder featuring abnormal development of the pancreas nose and scalp with mental retardation hearing loss and growth failure  it is sometimes described as a form of ectodermal dysplasia  the disorder is especially noted for causing profound developmental errors and exocrine dysfunction of the pancreas and it is considered to be an inherited pancreatic disease    the most prominent effect of jbs is pancreatic exocrine insufficiency      varying degrees of decreased secretion of lipases pancreatic juices such as trypsin trypsinogen and others as well as malabsorption of fats and disruptions of glucagon secretion and its response to hypoglycemia caused by insulin activity are major concerns when jbs is diagnosed    associated with developmental errors impaired apoptosis and both prenatal and chronic inflammatory damage necrosis and fibrosis of the pancreatic acini clusters of pancreatic exocrine gland tissue where secretion of pancreatic juice and related enzymes occurs pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in jbs can additionally stem from congenital replacement of the acini with fatty tissue      near total replacement of the entire pancreas with fatty tissue has also been reported this is a progressive sometimes fatal consequence of the disorder  endocrine insufficiency of the pancreas occurs with jbs though it is sometimes less common and less pronounced than the more prominent effects on exocrine function  the islets of langerhans are ducts in the pancreas where endocrine activity such as the release of hormones glucagon somatostatin and insulin takes place pancreatic endocrine insufficiency in jbs can be associated with either a buildup of connective tissue in the islet regions congenital replacement of the islets with fatty tissue or improper nerve signalling to the islets      endocrine dysfunction of the pancreas often results in diabetes mellitus both insulin resistance and diabetes have been observed with jbs and it is suggested that diabetes should be considered as a complication of jbs and its course   ductular output of fluids and electrolytes is preserved in the pancreas of many with jbs as well as moderate to normal levels of functioning bicarbonate  endocrine abnormalities in other areas have also been present with the disorder these include hypothyroidism  growth hormone deficiency   and hypopituitarism  findings affecting pituitary function in some jbs patients have included such anomalies as the formation of a glial hamartoma a neoplasm or tumor composed of glial cells on a lobe of the pituitary gland as well congenital underdevelopment of the anterior pituitary  growth failure and associated short stature dwarfism in jbs can be attributed to growth hormone deficiency caused by diminished anterior pituitary function with malabsorption of fats playing a subsequent role    the primary malformation apparent with jbs is hypoplasia underdevelopment of the nasal alae or wing of the nose    both hypoplasia and aplasia partial or complete absence of structural cartilage and tissue in this area of the nose along with the underlying alae nasi muscle are prevailing features of the disorder together these malformations give the nose and nostrils an odd shape and appearance   mental retardation ranging from mild to severe is present in the majority of jbs patients and is related to the deleterious nature of the known mutagen responsible for the disorder and its effects on the developing central nervous system    normal intelligence and age appropriate social development however have been reported in a few instances of jbs   findings with the inner ear in jbs give explanation to the presence of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in most patients affected by the disorder the formation of cystic tissue in both the cochlea and vestibule with resulting dilation widening and malformation of these delicate structures has been implicated    congenital deformations of the temporal bone and associated adverse anatomical effects on innervation and development of the inner ear also contribute to this type of hearing loss   other abnormalities affecting the scalp head face jaw and teeth may be found with jbs these include ectodermal midline scalp defects with sparse oddlypatterned hair growth   aplasia cutis underdeveloped very thin skin over the head  an enlarged fontanelle soft spot on the head of young infants  microcephaly undersized skull  prominent forehead  absence of eyebrows and eyelashes  mongoloidal eye shape  nasolacrimocutaneous fistulae this refers to the formation of an abnormal secondary passageway from either the tear duct or lacrimal sac to the facial skin surface possibly discharging fluid  flattened ears  micrognathism of the maxilla and mandible underdevelopment of the upper and lower jaw respectively with the maxilla more prominently affected in some cases    congenital clefting of bones surrounding the optical orbit eye socket such as the frontal and lacrimal bone  and maldeveloped deciduous teeth baby teeth with an absence of permanent teeth   additional congenital anomalies effects on other organs and less common features of jbs have included imperforate anus occlusion of the anus  vesicoureteral reflux reversal of the flow of urine from the bladder back into the ureters toward the kidneys  duplex of the uterus and vagina in female infants  neonatal cholestasis of the liver with cirrhosis and portal hypertension high blood pressure in the hepatic portal vein  dilated cardiomyopathy  dextrocardia congenital displacement of the heart to the right side of the chest  atrial and ventricular septal defect  low birthweight  failure to thrive  hypotonia decreased muscle tone  sacral hiatus a structural deficiency of the sacral vertebrae  congenital cataracts  and cafeaulait spots  jbs is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner  this means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome and two copies of the defective gene one inherited from each parent are required in order to be born with the disorder the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder johansonblizzard syndrome is caused by mutations in the ubr1 gene which encodes one of several ubiquitin ligase enzymes of the nend rule pathway   the protein ubiquitin is a universal ubiquitously expressed protein common to eukaryotic organisms ubiquitin plays a role in the regulation of other proteins by tagging them for eventual degradation by proteasomes  this process begins when ubiquitin ligase covalently attaches a ubiquitin molecule to the lysine side chain of the target protein substrate the misfolded damaged malfunctioning or unneeded protein that needs to be degraded this is repeated a number of times in succession forming a chain of ubiquitin molecules which is a process referred to as polyubiquitination the polyubiquitination of the target protein signals the proteasome to break it down which it does via proteolysis  the ubiquitinproteasome system plays a crucial role in the nonlysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins and ubiquitin can also participate in modifying proteins to perform certain tasks    both degradation and modification of proteins within the cell are part of a broader regulatory scheme necessary for cellular processes such as cell division cell signalling cell surface receptor function apoptosis dna maintenance inflammatory response and developmental quality control associated with the cell cycle and homeostasis in general   ubiquitinmediated degradation of proteins occurs through the nend rule pathway   in eukaryotes including humans the nend rule pathway is part of the ubiquitin system  composed of a highly selective singleresidue code a single amino acid nucleotide sequence the nend rule serves as a mechanism which can relate the stability of a protein to the identity of the amino acid at its nterminus the end of the polypeptide with an amino group which in the ubiquitin system may be involved in the reactive destabilization of the protein    in jbs mutations in the ubr1 gene alter disrupt or prevent the synthesis of ubiquitin ligase   in the pancreatic acinar cells ubr1 is more highly expressed than anywhere else in the body  impairment of the ubiquitinproteasome system directly related to insufficient activity of ubiquitin ligase has been established as the cause of both congenital and progressive inflammatory damage fatty tissue replacement connective tissue proliferation and errors in innervation of the acini and islets correlating to failures of normal apoptotic destruction of damaged cells and constitutive malpresence of proteins    this also applies to other areas affected by deleterious ubr1 expression such as the craniofacial area musculoskeletal and nervous systems dentition and organs    missense nonsense and splice site mutations of the ubr1 gene in both parents have been found with jbs confirming the homozygous nature of the jbs phenotype variability of the phenotype associated with residual ubiquitin ligase activity in some patients has also been attributed to hypomorphic mutations occasionally found in either of the carrier parents      the ubr1 gene is located on human chromosome 15  while there is no cure for jbs treatment and management of specific symptoms and features of the disorder are applied and can often be successful variability in the severity of jbs on a casebycase basis determines the requirements and effectiveness of any treatment selected pancreatic insufficiency and malabsorption can be managed with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy such as pancrelipase supplementation and other related methods  craniofacial and skeletal deformities may require surgical correction using techniques including bone grafts and osteotomy procedures  sensorineural hearing loss can be managed with the use of hearing aids and educational services designated for the hearing impaired   special education specialized counseling methods and occupational therapy designed for those with mental retardation have proven to be effective for both the patient and their families  this too is carefully considered for jbs patients johansonblizzard syndrome was named after ann j johanson and robert m blizzard the pediatricians who first described the disorder in a 1971 journal report

V syringomyelia s\u1d7b\u02ccr\u026a\u014b\u0261\u0259ma\u026a\u02c8i\u02d0li\u0259 \u0261o\u028a   is a generic term referring to a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord this cyst called a syrinx can expand and elongate over time destroying the spinal cord the damage may result in pain paralysis weakness  and stiffness in the back shoulders and extremities syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold especially in the hands the disorder generally leads to a capelike loss of pain and temperature sensation along the back and arms each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms these symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and often more critically to the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord syringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 84 cases per 100000 people  with symptoms usually beginning in young adulthood signs of the disorder tend to develop slowly although sudden onset may occur with coughing straining or myelopathy   syringomyelia causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms due to damage of the spinal cord patients may experience severe chronic pain abnormal sensations and loss of sensation particularly in the hands some patients experience paralysis or paresis temporarily or permanently a syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems leading to abnormal body temperature or sweating bowel control issues or other problems if the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem as in syringobulbia vocal cord paralysis ipsilateral tongue wasting trigeminal nerve sensory loss and other signs may occur  rarely bladder stones can occur in the onset of weakness in the lower extremities  classically syringomyelia spares the dorsal columnmedial lemniscus of the spinal cord leaving pressure vibration touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities neuropathic arthropathy also known as a charcot joint can occur particularly in the shoulders in patients with syringomyelia the loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to damage of the joint over time  generally there are two forms of syringomyelia congenital and acquired in addition one form of the disorder involves the brainstem the brainstem controls many of our vital functions such as respiration and heartbeat when syrinxes affect the brainstem the condition is called syringobulbia the first major form relates to an abnormality of the brain called an arnoldchiari malformation this is the most common cause of syringomyelia where the anatomic abnormality which may be due to a small posterior fossa causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal a syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord here symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining or any activity that causes cerebrospinal fluid pressure to fluctuate suddenly some patients however may have long periods of stability some patients with this form of the disorder also have hydrocephalus in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull or a condition called arachnoiditis in which a covering of the spinal cordthe arachnoid membraneis inflamed some cases of syringomyelia are familial although this is rare the second major form of syringomyelia occurs as a complication of trauma meningitis hemorrhage a tumor or arachnoiditis here the syrinx or cyst develops in a segment of the spinal cord damaged by one of these conditions the syrinx then starts to expand this is sometimes referred to as noncommunicating syringomyelia symptoms may appear months or even years after the initial injury starting with pain weakness and sensory impairment originating at the site of trauma the primary symptom of posttraumatic syringomyelia often referred to using the abbreviation of pts  is pain which may spread upward from the site of injury symptoms such as pain numbness weakness and disruption in temperature sensation may be limited to one side of the body syringomyelia can also adversely affect sweating sexual function and later bladder and bowel control a typical cause of pts would be a car accident or similar trauma involving a whiplash injury what can make pts difficult to diagnose is the fact that symptoms can often first appear long after the actual cause of the syrinx occurred eg a car accident occurring and then the patient first experiencing pts symptoms such as pain loss of sensation reduced ability on the skin to feel varying degrees of hot and cold a number of months after the car accident the pathogenesis of syringomyelia is debatedthe cerebrospinal fluid also serves to cushion the brain excess cerebrospinal fluid in the central canal of the spinal cord is called hydromyelia this term refers to increased cerebrospinal fluid that is contained within the ependyma of the central canal when fluid dissects into the surrounding white matter forming a cystic cavity or syrinx the term syringomyelia is applied as these conditions coexist in the majority of cases the term syringohydromyelia is applied the terms are used interchangeably it has been observed that obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces in the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation and alleviation of the obstruction may improve symptoms a number of pathological conditions can cause an obstruction of the normal cerebrospinal fluid spaces these include chiari malformation spinal arachnoiditis scoliosis spinal vertebrae misalignment spinal tumors spina bifida and others the reasons that blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid space within the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation are not fully understood although a small posterior fossa is one known cause it is unclear if syrinx fluid originates from bulk movement of cerebrospinal fluid into the spinal cord from bulk transmural movement of blood fluids through the spinal vasculature into the syrinx or from a combination of both recent work suggests that central nervous system compliance is the underlying problem for the central nervous system and also that hydrocephalus and syringomyelia have related causes physicians now use magnetic resonance imaging mri to diagnose syringomyelia the mri radiographer takes images of body anatomy such as the brain and spinal cord in vivid detail this test will show the syrinx in the spine or any other conditions such as the presence of a tumor mri is safe painless and informative and has greatly improved the diagnosis of syringomyelia the physician may order additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis one of these is called electromyography emg which measures muscle weakness in addition computed axial tomography ct scans of a patients head may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus like mri and ct scans another test called a myelogram uses radiographs and requires a contrast medium to be injected into the subarachnoid space since the introduction of mri this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia the possible causes are trauma tumors and congenital defects it is most usually observed in the part of the spinal cord corresponding to the neck area symptoms are due to spinal cord damage and are pain decreased sensation of touch weakness and loss of muscle tissue the diagnosis is confirmed with a spinal ct myelogram or mri of the spinal cord the cavity may be reduced by surgical decompression furthermore evidence also suggests that impact injuries to the thorax area highly correlate with the occurrence of a cervicallocated syrinx the first step after diagnosis is finding a neurosurgeon who is experienced in the treatment of syringomyelia surgery is the treatment for syringomyelia evaluation of the condition is necessary because syringomyelia can remain stationary for long periods of time and in some cases progress rapidly surgery of the spinal cord has certain characteristic risks associated with it and the benefits of a surgical procedure on the spine have to be weighed against the possible complications associated with any procedure surgical treatment is aimed at correcting the condition that allowed the syrinx to form it is vital to bear in mind that the drainage of a syrinx does not necessarily mean the elimination of the syrinxrelated symptoms but rather is aimed at stopping progression in cases involving an arnoldchiari malformation the main goal of surgery is to provide more space for the cerebellum at the base of the skull and upper cervical spine without entering the brain or spinal cord this often results in flattening or disappearance of the primary syrinx or cavity over time as the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid is restored if a tumor is causing syringomyelia removal of the tumor is the treatment of choice and almost always eliminates the syrinx surgery results in stabilization or modest improvement in symptoms for most patients delay in treatment may result in irreversible spinal cord injury recurrence of syringomyelia after surgery may make additional operations necessary these may not be completely successful over the long term in some patients it may also be necessary to drain the syrinx which can be accomplished using a catheter drainage tubes and valves this system is also known as a shunt shunts are used in both the communicating and noncommunicating forms of the disorder first the surgeon must locate the syrinx then the shunt is placed into it with the other end draining cerebrospinal fluid csf into a cavity usually the abdomen this type of shunt is called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and is particularly useful in cases involving hydrocephalus by draining syrinx fluid a shunt can arrest the progression of symptoms and relieve pain headache and tightness syringomyelia shunts are not always successful and can become blocked as with other central nervous system shunts the decision to use a shunt requires extensive discussion between doctor and patient as this procedure carries with it greater risk of injury to the spinal cord infection blockage or hemorrhage and may not necessarily work for all patients draining the syrinx more quickly does not produce better outcomes but a shunt may be required if the fluid in the syrinx is otherwise unable to drain in the case of traumarelated syringomyelia the surgeon operates at the level of the initial injury the syrinx collapses at surgery but a tube or shunt is usually necessary to prevent reexpansion surgery is not always recommended for syringomyelia patients for many patients the main treatment is analgesia physicians specializing in pain management can develop a medication and treatment plan to ameliorate pain medications to combat any neuropathic pain symptoms such as shooting and stabbing pains eg gabapentin or pregabalin would be firstline choices opiates are usually prescribed for pain for management of this condition facet injections are not indicated for treatment of syringomyelia drugs have no curative value as a treatment for syringomyelia radiation is used rarely and is of little benefit except in the presence of a tumor in these cases it can halt the extension of a cavity and may help to alleviate pain in the absence of symptoms syringomyelia is usually not treated in addition a physician may recommend not treating the condition in patients of advanced age or in cases where there is no progression of symptoms whether treated or not many patients will be told to avoid activities that involve straining since the natural history of syringomyelia is poorly understood a conservative approach may be recommended when surgery is not yet advised patients should be carefully monitored by a neurologist or neurosurgeon periodic mris and physical evaluations should be scheduled at the recommendation of a qualified physician the precise causes of syringomyelia are still unknown although blockage to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid has been known to be an important factor since the 1970s scientists in the uk and america continue to explore the mechanisms that lead to the formation of syrinxes in the spinal cord it has been demonstrated a block to the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid is a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of the disease duke university in america and warwick university are conducting research to explore genetic features of syringomyelia  surgical techniques are also being refined by the neurosurgical research community successful procedures expand the area around the cerebellum and spinal cord thus improving the flow of cerebrospinal fluid thereby reducing the syrinx it is also important to understand the role of birth defects in the development of hindbrain malformations that can lead to syringomyelia as syringomyelia is a feature of intrauterine life and is also associated with spina bifida learning when these defects occur during the development of the fetus can help us understand this and similar disorders and may lead to preventive treatment that can stop the formation of some birth abnormalities dietary supplements of folic acid prior to pregnancy have been found to reduce the number of cases of spina bifida and are also implicated in prevention of cleft palate and some cardiac defects diagnostic technology is another area for continued research mri has enabled scientists to see conditions in the spine including syringomyelia before symptoms appear a new technology known as dynamic mri allows investigators to view spinal fluid flow within the syrinx ct scans allow physicians to see abnormalities in the brain and other diagnostic tests have also improved greatly with the availability of new nontoxic contrast dyes

V genu varum also called bowleggedness bandiness bandyleg and tibia vara is a physical deformity marked by outward bowing of the lower leg in relation to the thigh giving the appearance of an archers bow usually medial angulation of both femur and tibia is involved   if a child is sickly either with rickets or any other ailment that prevents ossification of the bones or is improperly fed the bowed condition may persist thus the chief cause of this deformity is rickets skeletal problems infection and tumors can also affect the growth of the leg sometimes giving rise to a onesided bowleggedness the remaining causes are occupational especially among jockeys and from physical trauma the condition being very likely to supervene after accidents involving the condyles of the femur  children until the age of 3 to 4 have a degree of genu varum the child sits with the soles of the feet facing one another the tibia and femur are curved outwards and if the limbs are extended although the ankles are in contact there is a distinct space between the kneejoints during the first year of life a gradual change takes place the kneejoints approach one another the femur slopes downward and inward towards the knee joints the tibia become straight and the sole of the foot faces almost directly downwards while these changes are occurring the bones which at first consist principally of cartilage are gradually becoming ossified by the time a normal child begins to walk the lower limbs are prepared both by their general direction and by the rigidity of the bones which form them to support the weight of the body  blounts disease is a deformity in the legs mostly from the knees to the ankles the affected bone curves in or out and forms the usual archers bow which can also be called bowlegs there are two types of blounts disease the first type is infantile this means that children under four are diagnosed with this disease blounts disease in this age is very risky because sometimes it is not detected and it passes to the second type of blounts disease the second type of blounts disease is found mostly in older children and in teenagers sometimes in one leg and sometimes in both the patients age determines how severe the diagnosis is  generally no treatment is required for idiopathic presentation as it is a normal anatomical variant in young children treatment is indicated when it persists beyond 3 and a half years old in the case of unilateral presentation or progressive worsening of the curvature when caused by rickets the most important thing is to treat the constitutional disease at the same time instructing the caregiver never to place the child on its feet in many cases this is quite sufficient in itself to effect a cure but matters can be hastened somewhat by applying splints when the deformity arises in older patients either from trauma or occupation the only permanent treatment is surgery but orthopaedic bracing can provide relief treatment for children with blounts disease is typically braces but surgery may also be necessary especially for teenagers the operation consists of removing a piece of tibia breaking the fibula and straightening out the bone there is also a choice of elongating the legs if not treated early enough the condition worsens quickly  in most cases persisting after childhood there is little or no effect on the ability to walk due to uneven stress and wear on the knees however even milder manifestations can see an accelerated onset of arthritis those with bowlegs and a genetic predisposition for developing arthritis will likely start having arthritic symptoms around age 30

V saymeyer syndrome is a rare xlinked genetic disorder that is mostly characterized as developmental delay it is one of the rare causes of short stature it is closely related with trigonocephaly a misshapen forehead due to premature fusion of bones in the skull people with saymeyer syndrome have impaired growth deficits in motor skills development and mental state    it is suggested that it is from a xlinked transmission    common signs of saymeyer syndrome are trigonocephaly as well as head and neck symptoms the head and neck symptoms come in the form of craniosynostosis affecting the metopic suture the dense connective tissue structure that divides the two halves of the skull in children which usually fuse together by the age of six symptoms of saymeyer syndrome other than developmental delay and short stature include the affected patients sometimes show a highly arched palate clinodactyly a defect in which toes or fingers are positioned abnormally and ventricular septal defect a heart defect that allows blood to pass directly from left to the right ventricle which is caused by an opening in the septum overall saymeyer syndrome impairs growth motor function and mental state  it is a disorder that is mostly characterized as developmental delay and short stature magnetic resonance imaging scans usually reveal that there is a decreased volume of white matter in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres a brain stem that is smaller in size and a thin corpus callosum nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain the syndrome is one of the rare causes of short stature  the growth retardation dates from the intrauterine period development in the uterus the longterm developmental growth and outcome is not known but the early childhood development is known which is said to be moderately delayed craniosynostosis is usually rare among the xlinked intellectual disability syndromes but when it is present it affects the metopic structure forehead  to treat the trigonocephaly expanding the distance between orbits using springs seems to work it allows enough space for the brain to grow and it creates a normal horizontal axis of the orbits and supraorbital bar the endoscopic surgery started to become popular since the early 90s but it has some technical limitations only strip cranictomy is possible there have been few attempts to go beyond the limits  aesthetic outcomes of metopic surgery have been good surgery does not have a perfect outcome because there will most likely be minor irregularities sometimes reoperations are needed for the severe cases trying to hollow out the temporal and the hypoterlorism are very hard to correct the hypotelorism usually stays not corrected and in order to correct the temporal hollowing a second operation is most likely needed   the saymeyer syndrome was named after burhan say and julia meyer in 1981 after they observed trigonocephaly in 3 males who were all related each male was found to have a xlinked recessive inheritance the oldest one was found to be mentally retarded while the other two nephews were found to have later on say and meyer have not been able to find any similar case and they classified the disorder as trigonocephaly with minor anomalies they considered it different from trigonocephaly because trigonocephaly only deals with a deformed head that leads to facial and cranial deformities saymeyer syndrome has both facial and cranial deformities as well as short stature and developmental delay

V crouzon syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder known as a branchial arch syndrome specifically this syndrome affects the first branchial or pharyngeal arch which is the precursor of the maxilla and mandible since the branchial arches are important developmental features in a growing embryo disturbances in their development create lasting and widespread effects this syndrome is named after octave crouzon   a french physician who first described this disorder he noted the affected patients were a mother and her daughter implying a genetic basis first called craniofacial dysostosis the disorder was characterized by a number of clinical features this syndrome is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor ii located on chromosome 10 breaking down the name craniofacial refers to the skull and face and dysostosis refers to malformation of bone now known as crouzon syndrome the disease can be described by the rudimentary meanings of its former name what occurs in the disease is that an infants skull and facial bones while in development fuse early or are unable to expand thus normal bone growth cannot occur fusion of different sutures leads to different patterns of growth of the skull examples include trigonocephaly fusion of the metopic suture brachycephaly fusion of the coronal suture dolichocephaly fusion of the sagittal suture plagiocephaly unilateral premature closure of lambdoid and coronal sutures oxycephaly fusion of coronal and lambdoidal sutures kleeblattschaedel premature closure of all sutures   as a result of the changes to the developing embryo the symptoms are very pronounced features especially in the face lowset ears are a typical characteristic as in all of the disorders which are called branchial arch syndromes the reason for this abnormality is that ears on a foetus are much lower than those on an adult during normal development the ears travel upward on the head however in crouzon patients this pattern of development is disrupted ear canal malformations are extremely common generally resulting in some hearing loss in particularly severe cases ménières disease may occur the most notable characteristic of crouzon syndrome is craniosynostosis as described above however it usually presents as brachycephaly resulting in the appearance of a short and broad head exophthalmos bulging eyes due to shallow eye sockets after early fusion of surrounding bones hypertelorism greater than normal distance between the eyes and psittichorhina beaklike nose are also symptoms additionally external strabismus is a common occurrence which can be thought of as opposite from the eye position found in down syndrome lastly hypoplastic maxilla insufficient growth of the midface results in relative mandibular prognathism chin appears to protrude despite normal growth of mandible and gives the effect of the patient having a concave face crouzon syndrome is also associated with patent ductus arteriosus pda and aortic coarctation for reasons that are not entirely clear most crouzon patients also have noticeably shorter humerus and femur bones relative to the rest of their bodies than members of the general population a small percentage of crouzon patients also have what is called type ii crouzon syndrome distinguished by partial syndactyly associations with mutations in the genes of fgfr2  and fgfr3  have been identified   diagnosis of crouzon syndrome usually can occur at birth by assessing the signs and symptoms of the baby further analysis including radiographs magnetic resonance imaging mri scans genetic testing xrays and ct scans can be used to confirm the diagnosis of crouzon syndrome surgery is typically used to prevent the closure of sutures of the skull from damaging the brains development without surgery blindness and mental retardation are typical outcomes craniofacial surgery is a discipline of both plastic surgery and oral and maxillofacial surgery oms  to move the orbits forward craniofacial surgeons expose the skull and orbits and reshape the bone to treat the midface deficiency craniofacial surgeons can move the lower orbit and midface bones forward for jaw surgery either plastic surgeons or oral and maxillofacial omfs surgeons can perform these operations crouzon patients tend to have multiple sutures involved most specifically bilateral coronal craniosynostoses and either open vault surgery or strip craniectomy if child is under 6 months can be performed in the later scenario a helmet is worn for several months following surgery once treated for the cranial vault symptoms crouzon patients generally go on to live a normal lifespan incidence of crouzon syndrome is currently estimated to occur in 16 out of every 100000 people  there is a greater frequency in families with a history of the disorder but that doesnt mean that everyone in the family is affected as referred to above for dentists this disorder is important to understand since many of the physical abnormalities are present in the head and particularly the oral cavity common features are a narrowhigharched palate posterior bilateral crossbite hypodontia missing some teeth and crowding of teeth due to maxillary hypoplasia crouzon patients generally have a considerable permanent underbite and subsequently cannot chew using their incisors for this reason people with crouzon symdrome sometimes eat in an unusual wayeating chicken drumsticks with a fork for example or breaking off pieces of a sandwich rather than taking a bite into it edar edar

V craniosynostosis from cranio cranium  syn together  ostosis relating to bone is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone ossification  thereby changing the growth pattern of the skull  because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture it compensates by growing more in the direction parallel to the closed sutures  sometimes the resulting growth pattern provides the necessary space for the growing brain but results in an abnormal head shape and abnormal facial features  in cases in which the compensation does not effectively provide enough space for the growing brain craniosynostosis results in increased intracranial pressure leading possibly to visual impairment sleeping impairment eating difficulties or an impairment of mental development combined with a significant reduction in iq  craniosynostosis occurs in one in 2000 births craniosynostosis is part of a syndrome in 15 to 40 of the patients but it usually occurs as an isolated condition   children born with craniosynostosis have a distinct appearance otherwise known as the phenotype the features of the phenotype are determined by which particular suture is closed  the fusion of this suture causes a certain change in the shape of the skull a deformity of the skull  virchows law dictates that when premature suture closure occurs growth of the skull typically is restricted perpendicularly to the fused suture and enhanced in a plane parallel to it thus trying to provide space for the fastgrowing brain  using this law the pattern of skull deformity in craniosynostosis often may be predicted  an illustrative example of this phenomenon is scaphocephaly the name providing a direct hint regarding the deformity of the skull the literal meaning of the greek derived word scaphocephaly is boathead a synonymous term is dolichocephaly the prefix dolicho means elongated  premature sagittal suture closure restricts growth in a perpendicular plane thus the head will not grow sideways and remain narrow   this is best seen in a view standing above the child looking downward at the top of the head  compensatory growth occurs forward at the coronal suture and backward at the lambdoid suture giving respectively a prominent forehead called frontal bossing and a prominent back portion of the head called coning   when viewed from sideways the resulting shape of the head will look a bit like a boat trigonocephaly is a result from the premature closure of the metopic suture   using virchows law again to predict the resulting deformity this fusion will result in a narrow forehead which is even further emphasized by ridging of the suture   compensatory growth occurs at both the coronal sutures thereby pushing the forehead forwards   the resulting shape can best be assessed from a top view again which will reveal a somewhat triangular form of the head  trigonocephaly is also a greek derived word which can be translated as triangular shaped head a facial feature of metopic synostosis is hypotelorism in the frontal view it can be seen that the width between the eyes is smaller than usual  the greek word plagios means skew plagiocephaly can be subclassified in anterior plagiocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly anterior plagiocephaly is a clinical description of unilateral coronal synostosis   children born with unilateral coronal synostosis develop due to compensatory mechanisms a skew head a plagiocephaly   the sagittal suture divides the coronal suture in two halves unilateral meaning that either the right side or the left side to the sagittal suture is fused this fact immediately raises an important point unlike closure of the sagittal or the metopic suture right and left are not the same in unilateral coronal synostosis   this asymmetry shows in the skull deformity as well as in the facial deformity and the complications   this time the skull deformity can only partly be predicted using virchows law growth is arrested in the plane perpendicular to the fused suture and the forehead is flattened but only at the ipsilateral side of the head   ipsilateral indicates the same side of the head as where the suture is closed compensatory growth occurs in a parallel plane as well as in a perpendicular plane   an increase in growth at the metopic and the sagittal suture accounts for the parallel plane and will result in bulging at the temporal fossa and an increase in width of the skull   compensatory growth in the perpendicular plane occurs on the side of the head with the patent coronal suture the contralateral side   half of the forehead will bulge forwards as a result assessment of the skull from a top view shows asymmetry of the frontal bones an increased width of the skull and a forward displacement of the ear at the ipsilateral side of the head  assessment of the skull from a frontal view will show asymmetrical features of the face including a displacement of the chin point of the jaw and a deviation of the tip of the nose   the chin point is located more to the contralateral side of the head due to the ipsilateral forward displacement of the temporomandibular joint together with the ear   the tip of the nose will also point towards the contralateral side   complications based on the skull deformation include malocclusion of the jaw and in as many as 90  a subtle form of  strabismus the last being caused by the asymmetrical placement of the orbits  unilateral lambdoid synostosis is also called posterior plagiocephaly  indicating that this gives just like unilateral coronal synostosis a skew head the difference is that this time the deformity mostly shows at the occiput remembering virchows law restriction of growth will occur at the ipsilateral side of the head compensatory growth will occur at the contralateral side of the head this growth pattern exerts an effect at the base of the skull which is not even when the child is assessed from a point of view standing behind the child as well as on the cervical spine which shows a curvature  in addition an asymmetry of the ears can be seen with the ear on the ipsilateral side placed further to the back also again from a point of view standing behind the child a bulging of the mastoid can be seen  minimal forehead asymmetries are typically seen  brachycephaly or a short head is the result of a closure of both the coronal sutures  following virchows law this will result in a childs head with a restriction of growth in the forward direction and in the backward direction recessed frontal bones and a flattened occiput  compensatory growth will occur sideways due to the sagittal suture and upwards due to the lambdoid sutures  oxycephaly also known as turricephaly and highhead syndrome is a type of cephalic disorder this is a term sometimes used to describe the premature closure of the coronal suture plus any other suture like the lambdoid suture the word pansynostosis is also greek derived and can be translated as all one bone indicating that all of the sutures are closed  in general practice the term is used to describe the children with three or more cranial sutures closed  pansynostosis can present in several ways the appearance can be the same as that seen with primary microcephaly a markedly small head but with normal proportions   however pansynostosis can also appear as a kleeblattschädel cloverleaf skull which presents with bulging of the different bones of the cranial vault   the condition is associated with thanatophoric dwarfism aperts syndrome an abnormal skull shape small upper jaw and fusion of the fingers and toes crouzons syndrome a craniofacial birth abnormalities with bilateral coronal suture fusion  anterior and posterior of skull shortness flat cheek bones and a flat nose are their features  pfeiffers syndrome abnormalities of the skull hands and feet wideset bulging eyes an underdeveloped upper jaw beaked nose  pierre robin syndrome abnormalities in the facial skeleton  resulting in a smaller than normal lower jaw or receding chin the tongue often falls back in the pharynges causing difficulty breathing saethechotzen syndrome short or broad head the eyes may be spaced wide apart and have palpebral ptosis droopy eyelids and fingers may be abnormally short and webbed   not all cranial abnormalities seen in children with craniosynostosis are solely a consequence of the premature fusion of a cranial suture this is especially true in the cases with syndromic craniosynostosis findings include elevation of the intracranial pressure obstructive sleep apnoeaosa abnormalities in the skull base and neurobehavioral impairment  when the icp is elevated the following symptomes may occur vomiting visual disturbance bulging of the anterior fontanel altered mental status papilledema and headache  the main risks of prolonged elevated intracranial pressure may include cognitive impairment and impaired vision through prolonged papilledema  these are the main reasons why fundoscopy should be performed during the physical examination of children with craniosynostosis  the causes of an elevation of the intracranial pressure are best understood using the monrokellie doctrine  the monrokellie doctrine reduces the cranial vault to a box with rigid walls  this box contains three elements brain intracranial blood and cerebrospinal fluid  the sum of volumes of these three elements is constant  an increase in one should cause a decrease in one or both of the remaining two thereby preventing an elevation of the intracranial pressure  a compensatory mechanism involves the movement of cerebrospinal fluid from the cranial vault towards the spinal cord  the volume of blood in the cranial vault is autoregulated by the brain and will therefore not decrease that easily  intracranial pressure will rise as a result of continued brain growth within the rigid skull  it appears that in children with craniosynostosis the expected decrease of intracranial blood is probably not occurring as it should according to the monrokellie hypothesis  this is shown when the brain expands in the fixed skull which gives a faster rise in intracranial pressure than would be expected  the short stops in breathing during the sleep are the mainstay of osa other symptoms can be difficulty in breathing snoring daytime sleepiness and perspiration  the main causative agent of osa is the midface hypoplasia which also poses a risk to the eyes that can be seen bulging out of the eye sockets other factors such as a micrognathism and adenoid hypertrophy are likely to contribute in causing osa  the most common syndromic forms of craniosynostosis ie apert crouzon and pfeiffer have an increased risk of developing osa the children have nearly 50 chance of developing this condition  a theory regarding the involvement of osa as a causative agent for elevated intracranial pressure suggests an association with the autoregulation of blood flow in the brain  certain cells in the brain respond specifically to an increase of co2 in the blood   the response involves vasodilatation of the cranial vault blood vessels increasing the volume of one of the elements in the monrokellie doctrine   the increase of co2 concentration in the blood is a consequence of impaired breathing especially seen when the child suffering from osa is sleeping   it is well documented that the highest spikes in intracranial pressure often occur during sleep   impaired venous outflow is often caused by a hypoplastic jugular foramen  this causes an increase in the intracranial blood volume thereby causing an increase in intracranial pressure  this can be further complicated with a possible arnoldchiari malformation which can partially obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid from the neurocranium to the spinal cord  the chiari malformation may be asymptomatic or present with ataxia spasticity or abnormalities in breathing swallowing or sleeping  due to the impaired venous outflow which may be further complicated with an arnoldchiari malformation there is often a clinical image of hydrocephalus present hydrocephalus is seen in 65 to 8 of patients with aperts syndrome 256 in patients with crouzons syndrome and 278 of those with pfeifers syndrome  ventriculomegaly is a usual finding in children with the apert syndrome  neurobehavioural impairment includes problems with attention and planning processing speed visual spatial skills language reading and spelling  a decreased iq may also be part of the problems  it has been suggested that these problems are caused by a primary malformation of the brain rather than being a consequence of the growth restriction of the skull and elevated intracranial pressure some evidence for this statement has been provided by studies using computed tomographic ct scans and magnetic resonance imaging mri to identify differences between the structures of the brains of healthy children and those affected with craniosynostosis  it has been found that corrective surgery of the cranial vault alters the morphology of the brain compared with the situation before surgical intervention  however the structure was still abnormal in comparison to children without craniosynostosis  advances in the fields of molecular biology and genetics as well as the use of animal models have been of great importance in expanding our knowledge of suture fusion  research in animal models has led to the idea that the dura mater plays an important role in determining closure or patency of the suture  in contrast to the dura mater it appears that the periosteum is not essential in causing closure or patency  instead of describing the abnormalities in structure and form research focuses nowadays at decoding the molecular interactions that underlie them  despite the progress that has been made many things are still not understood about the suture biology and the exact causative pathways remain yet to be completely understood multiple potential causes of premature suture closure have been identified such as the several genetic mutations that are associated with syndromic craniosynostosis  the cause of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis however is still greatly unknown  most likely a role is played by biomechanical factors as well as environmental hormonal and genetical factors  new insights have given fuel to a debate whether there might be an intrinsic factor causing the premature fusion of the sutures brain structures of children with craniosynostosis were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging  differences were seen compared with the brain structures of normal children  the question now is whether these differences are caused by the craniosynostosis or are the cause of craniosynostosis biomechanical factors include fetal head constraint during pregnancy  it has been found by jacob et al that constraint inside the womb is associated with decreased expression of indian hedgehog protein and noggin these last two are both important factors influencing bone development  environmental factors refer for example to maternal smoking and the maternal exposure to aminecontaining drugs several research groups have found evidence that these environmental factors are responsible for an increase in the risk of craniosynostosis likely through effects on fibroblast growth factor receptor genes      on the other hand a recent evaluation of valproic acid an antiepilepticum which has been implicated as a causative agent has shown no association with craniosynostosis  certain medication like aminecontaining drugs can increase the risk of craniosynostosis when taken during pregnancy these are socalled teratogenic factors   hyperthyroid induced craniosynostosis is a hormone mediated premature closure  it is thought that the bone matures faster due to high levels of thyroid hormone  in 6 to 11 of the children born with coronal synostosis more often involving the bilateral cases than unilateral other members of the family have been reported that were also born with the same condition  this finding is highly suggestive of a genetic cause which has possibly been found in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 fgfr3 and twist genes  fibroblast growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors regulate fetal bone growth and are expressed in cranial sutures during pregnancy  the transcription factor gene twist is thought to decrease the function of fgfr thus also indirectly regulating fetal bone growth  a relation between the mutations in these genes and craniosynostosis is therefore possible moloney et al observed a fgfr3 mutation in as many as 31 of the cases with nonsyndromic coronal synostosis thus showing that fgfr abnormalities play an important role in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis  in terms of syndromic craniosynostosis not only do fgfr3 and twist genes feature but also fgfr1 and in particular fgfr2 which has been reported in 90 of the syndromic craniosynostoses such as apert crouzon peiffer and jacksonweiss     the mutations can be divided into mutations that lead to gain of function in fgfr genes and mutations that lead to loss of function in twist genes   craniosynostosis is therefore likely the result of a disturbance in the fine balance that regulates the multiplication and maturation of the precursor bone cells in the cranial sutures  the familial rate which is different for nonsyndromic and syndromic cases provides an important clue   in the nonsyndromic cases a positive family history is found in 2 of the cases with sagittal suture closure   and in 6 to 11 of the cases with coronal suture closure  in the syndromic cases approximately 50 of the children may present with a positive family history  the mesenchyme above the meninges undergoes intramembranous ossification forming the neurocranium  the neurocranium consists of several bones which are united and at the same time separated by fibrous sutures  this allows movement of the separate bones in relation to one another the infant skull is still malleable  the fibrous sutures specifically allow the deformation of the skull during birth  and absorb mechanical forces during childhood  they also allow the necessary expansion during brain growth  in the very first years of life the sutures serve as the most important centers of growth in the skull  the growth of the brain and the patency of the sutures depend on each other  brain growth pushes the two sides of the patent sutures away from each other thereby enabling growth of the neurocranium  this means that the neurocranium can only grow if the sutures remain open  the neurocranium will not grow when the forces induced by brain growth are not there  this will occur for example when the intracranial pressure drops the sutures do not experience stretching anymore causing them to fuse  the infants skull consists of the metopic suture coronal sutures sagittal suture and lambdoid sutures  the metopic suture is supposed to close between three to nine months of age  the lambdoid sagittal and coronal sutures are supposed to close between 22 to 39 months of age  the evaluation of a child suspected to have craniosynostosis is preferentially performed in a craniofacial center the three main elements of analysis include medical history physical examination and radiographic analysis medical history should in any case include questions about risk factors during pregnancy the familial rate and the presence of symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure icp fundoscopy should always be performed in children with craniosynostosis  it is used to find papilledema which is sometimes the only symptom of elevated intracranial pressure shown in these children  other parts of the physical examination include the measurement of the head circumference the assessment of the skull deformity and the search for deformities affecting other parts of the body  the head circumference and the growth curve of the head provide important clues into making a differentiation between craniosynostosis primary microcephaly and hydrocephalus  this differentiation has an important influence on the further treatment of the child  in a recent article cunningham et al  described several steps in which a pediatrician should observe the patient to assess skull deformity the implications of the deformities that are seen are extensively discussed under phenotype syndromal craniosynostosis presents with a skull deformity as well as deformities affecting other parts of the body  clinical examination should in any case include evaluation of the neck spine digits and toes  radiographic analysis by performing a computed axial tomographic scan is the gold standard for diagnosing craniosynostosis   plain radiography of the skull may be sufficient for diagnosing a single suture craniosynostosis and should therefore be performed   but the diagnostic value is outweighed by that of the ctscan  not only can the sutures be identified more accurately thus objectively demonstrating a fused suture but also evaluation of the brain for structural abnormalities and excluding other causes of asymmetric growth are possible at the same time  in addition to this ctscanning can visualize the extent of skull deformity thereby enabling the surgeon to start planning surgical reconstruction  there are several ways to classify craniosynostosis in addition the following syndromes have been identified the main difference between plagiocephaly based on craniosynostosis and deformational plagiocephaly is that there is no suture fusion in the latter one  the malleability of the neonatal skull allows the skull to change shape due to extrinsic forces  with the tests a pediatrician should perform as explained above the difference is quite easy to make  in deformational plagiocephaly the skull does not show a bulging of the mastoid and in these patients the skull base and position of the ears is level all in contrary with plagiocephaly due to craniosynostosis  displacement of one ear to the front is characteristic for deformational plagiocephaly  primary microcephaly shows a clinical image of craniosynostosis but due to a different cause the primary failure is the absence of growth of the brain rendering the sutures of the cranial vault useless  as a consequence the sutures close presenting a pansynostosis like image  a differentiation between these two conditions can be made with a computed tomography ct scan the subarachnoid spaces are typically enlarged with primary microcephaly whereas they are reduced or absent in true pansynostosis  the primary goal in surgical intervention is to allow normal cranial vault development to occur  this can be achieved by excision of the prematurely fused suture and correction of the associated skull deformities  if the synostosis goes uncorrected the deformity will progressively worsen not only threatening the aesthetic aspect but also the functional aspect  this is especially the case in the asymmetric conditions such as unilateral coronal synostosis with compromised function of the eyes and the jaw  in addition signs of compromised neurodevelopment have been seen amongst all the synostoses although this may also be caused by primary maldevelopment of the brain and can thus not be prevented by surgical intervention  there are a few basic elements involved in the surgical intervention aimed at normalization of the cranial vault the prevention of the complications mentioned above plays an important role in the discussion about the timing of the surgery the general consensus is now to perform surgery in late infancy ie between six to twelve months  in this time frame the efficacy of surgery is enhanced due to several reasons the reason why most surgeons will not intervene until after the age of six months is the greater risk that blood loss poses before this age  if possible it is preferred to wait until after three months of age when the anaesthetic risks are decreased  surgery is not performed in early childhood in every country in some countries surgical intervention can take place in the late teens it is important that families seek out a pediatric craniofacial physician who has experience with craniosynostosis for proper diagnosis surgical care and followup there are two surgical procedures which are commonly used to treat sagittal synostosis  which of the two is the best is still heavily debated amongst the surgeons treating this condition  it is generally agreed upon that the cephalic index should be used to assess the efficacy of the surgical intervention  retrospective analysis has given indication that the use of total cranial vault remodelling provides the children with a better cephalic index than does the extended strip craniectomy  an approach that is currently evaluated is the use of springs this intervention is likely most effective when used in the time frame between three to six months the main elements of metopic suture closure are a low volume of the anterior cranial fossa the metopic ridging and hypotelorism  these problems are all addressed during the surgical intervention  the volume is increased by placing the frontal bones and the supraorbital rim further forward  this is done by excision of the bones after which they are reshaped with greenstick fracturing  replacement of the bones provides a possibility for the correction of the hypotelorism at the same time  a bone graft is placed in between the two halves of the supraorbital bars thereby increasing the width between the orbits  the metopic ridge can be corrected with a simple burring  the treatment of unilateral coronal synostosis typically exists out of two parts the forward advancement of the supraorbital bar and the correction of the orbital asymmetry  the supraorbital bar is the rim just above the eye socket as discussed under phenotype the supraorbital and the frontal bone are typically recessed at the ipsilateral side of the head  the goal is to position this bar together with the frontal bone in a plane three millimetres further forwards than the vertical plane of the cornea  a twodimensional sagittal image is used to preoperatively determine the extent of movement which can vary between seven to fifteen millimetres depending on the severity of the deformity  the orbital asymmetry exists typically of a narrower and taller orbit at the ipsilateral side of the head  the contralateral orbit however is wider than usual  the symmetry is restored by extracting a small piece of bone from the supraorbital bar at the contralateral side thereby reducing the width  this bone fragment is introduced into the supraorbital bar on the ipsilateral side thereby increasing the width  the height of the orbit is just altered at the ipsilateral side by extracting a piece of bone  the correction of the nasal tip which points towards the contralateral side is not performed during childhood  an excision of the flattened occipital bone with release of the fused suture tends to correct the cranial vault deformity  the treatment of bilateral coronal synostosis shows great overlap with the treatment of unilateral coronal synostosis in both surgical interventions is the forward advancement of the supraorbital rim together with the frontal bones an important part of the procedure   again is the plane three millimetres further forwards than the vertical plane of the cornea the appropriate position to place the bone   the increased height of the skull is addressed in the same procedure  parts of the flattened occiput are extracted and given a rounder shape by greenstick fracturing them  the treatment of pansynostosis comprises the expansion of the anterior cranial vault as well as the posterior cranial vault  this can be accomplished in one procedure but is generally performed in two  the main complications related to uncorrected craniosynostosis include increased intracranial pressure asymmetry of the face and malocclusion asymmetry of the orbits leads to strabismus  it is estimated that craniosynostosis affects 1 in 2000 to 2500 live births worldwide  sagittal synostosis is the most common phenotype representing 40 to 55 of nonsyndromic cases  the second most common type is the coronal synostosis representing 20 to 25  the metopic synostosis comes third with 5 to 15 and the lambdoid synostosis is only seen in 0 to 5 of nonsyndromic cases  in about 5 to 15 more than one suture is affected which referred to as complex craniosynostosis this is generally part of a syndrome

V infants persistent thumbclutched hand  flexionadduction deformity of the thumb  pollex varus  thumb in the hand deformity  congenital clasped thumb describes an anomaly which is characterized by a fixed thumb into the palm at the metacarpophalangeal joint in one or both hands  the incidence and genetic background are unknown a study of weckesser et al showed that boys are twice as often affected with congenital clasped thumb compared to girls the anomaly is in most cases bilateral present in both hands  a congenital clasped thumb can be an isolated anomaly but can also be attributed to several syndromes   the thumb contains five groups of muscle andor tendons in order for the thumb to maintain a normal position a strict balance between these groups is required weak or absent extensors andor abductors the extensor pollicis brevis tendon the extensor pollicis longus tendon or rarely the abductor pollicis longus tendon can cause a disbalance leading to an abnormal position of the thumb congenital clasped thumb there is also the possibility that two tendons are affected simultaneously the following tendon deviations can induce congenital clasped thumb furthermore a tight thumb web space the area between thumb and index finger can contribute to congenital clasped thumb the thumb cannot be properly abducted moved outwards if the web space is too tight to summarize the causes of congenital clasped thumbs may vary between patients and can sometimes be a combination of the preceding components treatment should be tailored to all occurring components in order to achieve good results there are a few different classifications conceived to categorize the spectrum of variety of congenital clasped thumb in literature x classifications have been described for clasped thumb the two most relevant of the existing classifications to our opinion are the classifications of mccarrol  and tjuyuguchi et al  the most global format is the classification of mccarrol which divides the congenital clasped thumbs into two groups group i includes the supple clasped thumb when the thumb is only passively correctable while complex clasped thumbs thumbs which cannot be moved neither passively or actively belong to group ii tjuyuguchi et al designed a classification existing of three groups diagnosing the congenital clasped thumb is difficult in the first three to four months of life as it is normal when the thumb is clutched into the palm in these first months  diagnoses that cause the same flexion or adduction abnormalities of the thumb are syndrome associated flexionadduction of the thumb treatment of congenital clasped thumb includes two types of therapy conservative and surgical treatment of all categories of congenital clasped thumbs should start with either serial plaster casting or wearing a static or dynamic splint for a period of six months  while massaging the hand extension by splinting shows reduction of the flexion contracture to gain optimal results it is important to start this treatment before the age of six months the result of this therapy is better in less severe deformities  in most uncomplicated cases a satisfactory result can be gained when splint therapy starts before the age of six months  splinting should be tried for at least three months and possibly for as long as six months or longer if the result of splint therapy stagnates surgery treatment is indicated  surgical treatment should be considered in patients who have not been treated at younger age or when conservative therapy fails surgery is recommended during the age of three to five years techniques other procedures

V the accessory nail of the fifth toe is a physical trait of the small toe where a minuscule sixth toenail is present in the outer corner of the nail situated on the smallest toe  it is commonly perceived to be especially prevalent amongst han chinese  however this is partially due to legend and is not entirely medically proven   the trait can be observed on either one or both feet where there is a separation of the toenail situated on the smallest toe the separated part of the nail forms a smaller sixth toenail on the corner of the larger or main section of the toenail on the outermost side of the foot which protrudes outwards from the corner of the larger nail the additional nail can be cut with a nail clipper just like any other nail the trait is commonly perceived to be widely present among han chinese although this has not been medically proven it is also present in other ethnic groups  chinese mythology follows that during the time of the yellow emperor there were two types of people living in china those who were the descendants of the yellow emperor and those who were nomadic qiang people as the henan people attacked the qiang led by yin wang they abducted a qiang woman who later tried to escape after yin wang stabbed her in the abdomen as she tried to escape she gave birth to two children with a scar on the small toe of the foot the children were taken back by yin wang for adoption and their descendants were born with double nails on their small toes

V arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid covered by arachnoidal cells and collagen  that may develop between the surface of the brain and the cranial base or on the arachnoid membrane one of the three membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord  arachnoid cysts are a congenital disorder  and most cases begin during infancy however onset may be delayed until adolescence    arachnoid cysts can be found on the brain or on the spine intracranial arachnoid cysts usually occur adjacent to the arachnoidal cistern  spinal arachnoid cysts may be extradural intradural or perineural and tend to present with signs and symptoms indicative of a radiculopathy  arachnoid cysts may also be classified as primary congenital or secondary acquired and have been reported in humans cats and dogs  arachnoid cysts can be relatively asymptomatic or present with insidious symptoms for this reason diagnosis is often delayed patients with arachnoid cysts may never show symptoms even in some cases where the cyst is large therefore while the presence of symptoms may provoke further clinical investigation symptoms independent of further data cannotand should notbe interpreted as evidence of a cysts existence size location or potential functional impact on the patient symptoms vary by the size and location of the cysts though small cysts usually have no symptoms and are discovered only incidentally  on the other hand a number of symptoms may result from large cysts the exact cause of arachnoid cysts is not known researchers believe that most cases of arachnoid cysts are developmental malformations that arise from the unexplained splitting or tearing of the arachnoid membrane in some cases arachnoid cysts occurring in the middle fossa are accompanied by underdevelopment hypoplasia or compression of the temporal lobe the exact role that temporal lobe abnormalities play in the development of middle fossa arachnoid cysts is unknown there are some cases where hereditary disorders have been connected with arachnoid cysts  some complications of arachnoid cysts can occur when a cyst is damaged because of minor head trauma trauma can cause the fluid within a cyst to leak into other areas eg subarachnoid space blood vessels on the surface of a cyst may tear and bleed into the cyst intracystic hemorrhage increasing its size if a blood vessel bleeds on the outside of a cyst a collection of blood hematoma may result in the cases of intracystic hemorrhage and hematoma the individual may have symptoms of increased pressure within the cranium and signs of compression of nearby nerve neural tissue a scientific debate is whether arachnoid cysts are a true congenite condition or if this should be separated from secondary cysts  a recent study show differences in communication between the arachnoid cyst and the subarachnoid space by ct cisternography   a comparison of arachnoid cyst fluid and csf in a series of patients show difference in chemical composition  arachnoid cysts can also occur secondary to other disorders such as marfan syndrome arachnoiditis or agenesis of the corpus callosum diagnosis is principally by mri frequently arachnoid cysts are incidental findings on mri scans performed for other clinical reasons in practice diagnosis of symptomatic arachnoid cysts requires symptoms to be present and many with the disorder never develop symptoms additional clinical assessment tools that can be useful in evaluating a patient with arachnoid cysts include the minimental state examination mmse a brief questionnairebased test used to assess cognition  most arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic and do not require treatment treatment may be necessary when symptomatic  a variety of procedures may be used to decompress remove pressure from the cyst most arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic and do not require treatment where complications are present leaving arachnoid cysts untreated may cause permanent severe neurological damage due to the progressive expansion of the cysts or hemorrhage bleeding  however with treatment most individuals with symptomatic arachnoid cysts do well more specific prognoses are listed below arachnoid cysts are seen in up to 11 of the population   with a gender distribution of 21 malefemale   only 20 of these have symptoms usually from secondary hydrocephalus  a study that looked at 2536 healthy young males found a prevalence of 17 95 ci 12 to 23 only a small percentage of the detected abnormalities require urgent medical attention

V sprengel deformity also known as high scapula or congenital high scapula is a rare congenital skeletal abnormality where a person has one shoulder blade that sits higher on the back than the other the deformity is due to a failure in early fetal development where the shoulder fails to descend properly from the neck to its final position the deformity is commonly associated with other conditions most notably klippelfeil syndrome congenital scoliosis including cervical scoliosis fused ribs the presence of an omovertebral bone and spina bifida the left shoulder is the most commonly affected shoulder but the condition can be bilateral meaning that both shoulders are affected about 75 of all observed cases are girls treatment includes surgery in early childhood and physical therapy surgical treatment in adulthood is complicated by the risk of nerve damage when removing the omovertebral bone and when stretching the muscle tissue during relocation of the shoulder the scapula is small and rotated so that its inferior edge points toward the spine there is a high correlation between sprengels deformity and the klippelfeil syndrome sometimes a bony connection is present between the elevated scapula and one of the cervical vertebrae usually c5 or c6 this connection is known as the omovertebral bone it is named for otto sprengel

V biliary atresia also known as extrahepatic ductopenia and progressive obliterative cholangiopathy is a childhood disease of the liver in which one or more bile ducts are abnormally narrow blocked or absent it can occur as a birth defect or as an acquired disease as a birth defect in newborn infants it has an incidence of one in 10000 to 15000 cases in live births in the united states  with the most accurate prevalence recorded at one in 16700 in the british isles   biliary atresia is most common in east asia with a frequency of one in 5000 in the congenital form the common bile duct between the liver and the small intestine is either blocked or absent the causes of biliary atresia are not well understood congenital biliary atresia has been associated with certain genes while acquired biliary atresia is thought to be the result of an autoimmune inflammatory response possibly to a viral infection of the liver soon after birth  the only effective treatments  are certain surgeries such as the kasai procedure and liver transplantation   initially the symptoms of biliary atresia are indistinguishable from neonatal jaundice a usually harmless condition commonly seen in infants after birth symptoms of biliary atresia are usually evident between one and six weeks after birth infants and children with biliary atresia develop progressive cholestasis a condition in which bile is unable to leave the liver and builds up inside of it when the liver is unable to excrete bilirubin through the bile ducts in the form of bile bilirubin begins to accumulate in the blood causing symptoms these symptoms include yellowing of the skin itchiness poor absorption of nutrients causing delays in growth pale stools dark urine and a swollen abdomen eventually cirrhosis with portal hypertension will develop if left untreated biliary atresia can lead to liver failure unlike other forms of liver failure however biliary atresiarelated liver failure does not result in kernicterus a form of brain damage resulting from liver dysfunction the reason for this is that the liver although diseased is still able to conjugate bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin is unable to cross the bloodbrain barrier there is no known cause of biliary atresia many theories have been proposed about possible causes of biliary atresia such as reovirus 3 infection  congenital malformation congenital cytomegalovirus infection  and autoimmune theory  however experimental evidence is insufficient to link any of these theories to the aetiology of biliary atresia  there have been extensive studies into the pathogenesis and proper management of progressive liver fibrosis  as the biliary tract cannot transport bile to the duodenum bile is retained in the liver a condition known as cholestasis which results in cirrhosis of the liver proliferation of the small bile ductules occur and peribiliary fibroblasts become activated these reactive biliary epithelial cells in cholestasis produce and secrete various cytokines such as ccl2 or mcp1 tumor necrosis factor tnf interleukin6 il6 tgfbeta endothelin et and nitric oxide no among these tgfbeta is the most important profibrogenic cytokine that can be seen in progressive liver fibrosis during the chronic activation of biliary epithelium and progressive fibrosis afflicted patients eventually show signs and symptoms of portal hypertension esophagogastric varix bleeding hypersplenism hepatorenal syndrome hrs hepatopulmonary syndrome hps the latter two syndromes are essentially caused by systemic mediators that maintain the body within the hyperdynamic states  there are three main types of extrahepatic biliary atresia approximately 10 of cases of biliary atresia associated anomalies include in about 10 cases heart lesions polysplenia situs inversus absent vena cava and a preduodenal portal vein  genetic association with the add3 gene was detected first in chinese populations through a genomewide association study and was confirmed later in thailand asians and caucasians a possible association with deletion of the gene gpc1 which encodes a glypican 1a heparan sulfate proteoglycan has been reported  this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 2q37 and is involved in the regulation of inflammation and the gene hedgehog eating plants that contain a toxin called biliatresone has been implicated in outbreaks of a biliary atresialike illness in lambs  studies are ongoing to determine whether there is a link between human cases of biliary atresia and toxins such as biliatresone there are some indications that a metabolite of certain human gut bacteria may be similar to biliatresone    diagnosis is made by assessing an individuals symptoms physical exam and medical history in conjunction with blood tests a liver biopsy and imaging diagnosis is often made following investigation of prolonged jaundice that is resistant to phototherapy andor exchange transfusions and abnormalities in liver enzymes tests are present ultrasound investigation or other forms of imaging can confirm the diagnosis further testing includes radioactive scans of the liver and a liver biopsy  if the intrahepatic biliary tree is unaffected surgical reconstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tract is possible through an operation known as a kasai procedure after the japanese surgeon who developed the surgery morio kasai or hepatoportoenterostomy this procedure is not usually curative but may temporarily alleviate symptoms until the child is fully grown and can undergo liver transplantation  if the atresia is complete liver transplantation is the only option timely kasai portoenterostomy eg  60 postnatal days has shown better outcomes nevertheless a considerable number of the patients even if kasai portoenterostomy has been successful eventually undergo liver transplantation within a couple of years after kasai portoenterostomy  recent large scale studies from davenport et al ann surg 2008 show that the age of the patient is not an absolute clinical factor affecting the prognosis in the latter study influence of age differs according to the disease etiologyie whether isolated ba basm ba with splenic malformation  or cbacystic biliary atresia  it is widely accepted that corticosteroid treatment after a kasai operation with or without choleretics and antibiotics has a beneficial effect on the postoperative bile flow and can clear the jaundice but the dosing and duration of the ideal steroid protocol have been controversial blast dose vs high dose vs low dose furthermore it has been observed in many retrospective longitudinal studies that corticosteroid treatment does not prolong survival of the native liver or transplantfree survival davenport et al also showed hepatology 2007 that shortterm lowdose steroid therapy following a kasai operation has no effect on the mid and longterm prognosis of biliary atresia patients  biliary atresia seems to affect females slightly more often than male  it is common for only one child in a pair of twins or only one child within the same family to have the condition  asians and africanamericans are affected more frequently than caucasians  there seems to be no link to medications or immunizations given immediately before or during pregnancy   as of 2013  numerous individuals are known to have undergone the kasai procedure and lived for more than a few years without requiring additional surgeries  a group existing on facebook as well as other social networking sites consists of patients and families who share their stories of both success and hardship

V schizencephaly from greek skhizein meaning to split and enkephalos meaning brain   is a rare birth defect characterized by abnormal clefts lined with grey matter that form the ependyma of the cerebral ventricles to the pia mater these clefts can occur bilaterally or unilaterally common clinical features of this malformation include epilepsy motor deficits and psychomotor retardation    schizencephaly can be distinguished from porencephaly by the fact that in schizencephaly the fluidfilled component if present is entirely lined by heterotopic grey matter while a porencephalic cyst is lined mostly by white matter individuals with clefts in both hemispheres or bilateral clefts are often developmentally delayed and have delayed speech and language skills and corticospinal dysfunction individuals with smaller unilateral clefts clefts in one hemisphere may be weak or paralyzed on one side of the body and may have average or nearaverage intelligence patients with schizencephaly may also have varying degrees of microcephaly mental retardation hemiparesis weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body or quadriparesis weakness or paralysis affecting all four extremities and may have reduced muscle tone hypotonia most patients have seizures and some may have hydrocephalus  in schizencephaly the neurons border the edge of the cleft implying a very early disruption of the usual grey matter migration during embryogenesis the cause of the disruption is not known but likely the cause may be either genetic or a physical insult such as infection infarction hemorrhage in utero stroke exposure to a toxin or mutation it is thought that normal neuron migration during the second trimester of intrauterine development when primitive neuron precursors germinal matrix migrate from just beneath the ventricular ependyma to the peripheral hemispheres where they form the cortical grey matter there was once thought to be a genetic association with the emx2 gene although this theory has recently lost support  however it has been confirmed that mutations in the col4a1 gene occur in some patients with schizencephaly  causes of schizencephaly may also be caused by environmental exposures during pregnancy sickness during pregnancy such as cytomegalovirus exposure to toxins or a vascular insult often there are additional associated heterotopias isolated islands of neurons which indicate a failure of migration of the neurons to their final position in the brain caused by possible stroke treatment for individuals with schizencephaly generally consists of physical therapy kgzns with vojta methode occupational therapy with specific emphasis on neurodevelopmental therapy techniques treatment for seizures  and in cases that are complicated by hydrocephalus a shunt the prognosis for individuals with schizencephaly varies depending on the size of the clefts and the degree of neurological deficit  in some cases the defect is linked to mutations of the emx2 six3 and sonic hedgehog genes because having a sibling with schizencephaly has been statistically shown to increase risk of the disorder it is possible that there is a heritable genetic component to the disease however there is no known genetic cause

V papillorenal syndrome also called renalcoloboma syndrome or isolated renal hypoplasia  is an autosomal dominant  genetic disorder marked by underdevelopment hypoplasia of the kidney and colobomas of the optic nerve    papillorenal syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that results from a mutation of one copy of the pax2 gene located on chromosome 10q243q251   the gene is important in the development of both the eye and the kidney autosomal dominant inheritance indicates that the gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome chromosome 10 is an autosome and only one defective copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder ocular disc dysplasia is the most notable ocular defect of the disease an abnormal development in the optic stalk causes optic disc dysplasia which is caused by a mutation in the pax2 gene  the nerve head typically resembles the morning glory disc anomaly but has also been described as a coloboma  a coloboma is the failure to close the choroid fissure which is the opening from the ventral side of the retina in the optic stalk  despite the similarities with coloboma and morning glory anomaly significant differences exist such that optic disc dysplasia cannot be classified as either one entity  optic disc dysplasia is noted by an illdefined inferior excavation convoluted origin of the superior retinal vessels excessive number of vessels infrapapillary pigmentary disturbance and slight band of retinal elevation adjacent to the disk  some patients have normal or near normal vision but others have visual impairment associated with the disease though it is not certain if this is due only to the dysplastic optic nerves or a possible contribution from macular and retinal malformations  the retinal vessels are abnormal or absent in some cases having small vessels exiting the periphery of the disc there is a great deal of clinical variability  the most common malformation in patients with the syndrome is kidney hypodysplasia which are small and underdeveloped kidneys often leading to endstage renal disease esrd  estimates show approximately 10 of children with hypoplastic kidneys are linked to the disease  many different histological abnormalities have been noted including up to onethird of diagnosed patients develop end stage kidney disease which may lead to complete kidney failure  the majority of mutations occur in exons 23 and 4 which encode the paired domain and frame shift mutations that lead to a null allele  the missense mutations appear to disrupt hydrogen bonds leading to decreased transactivation of pax2 but do not seem to effect nuclear localization steady state mrna levels or the ability of pax2 to bind to its dna consensus sequence  mutations related to the disease have also been noted in exons 78 and 9 with milder phenotypes than the other mutations  pax2 is expressed in the kidney midbrain hindbrain cells in the spinal column developing ear and developing eye homozygous negative pax2 mutation is lethal but heterozygote mutants showed many symptoms of papillorenal syndrome including optic nerve dysplasia with abnormal vessels emerging from the periphery of the optic cup and small dysplasic kidneys it is shown that pax2 is under upstream control of shh in both mice and zebrafish which is expressed in the precordal plate  approximately half of patients with papillorenal syndrome do not have defects in the pax2 this suggests that other genes play a role in the development of the syndrome though few downstream effectors of pax2 have been identified  the severity varies but the most severe form results in an enlarged disc where vessels exit from the periphery instead of the center redundant fibroglial tissue also is seen in severe cases milder forms of dysplasia exhibit missing portions of the optic disc located in the optic nerve pit the least severe form of papillorenal disease shown in the eye is the exiting of blood vessels from the periphery that do not disturb the shape of the eye other eye malformations include scleral staphyloma which is the bulging of the eye wall there can also be retinal thinning and myopia additionally there can be an optic nerve cyst which is dilation of the optic nerve posterior to the globe which most likely results from incomplete regression of the primordial optic stalk and the filling of this area with fluid retinal coloboma is also common which is characterized by the absence of retinal tissue in the nasal ventral portion of the retina however this is an extremely rare finding  sequence analysis shows that pax2 is the only known gene associated with the disease mutations in pax2 have been identified in half of renal coloboma syndrome victims

V neural tube defects ntds are a group of conditions in which an opening in the spinal cord or brain remains from early in human development in the 3rd week of pregnancy called gastrulation specialized cells on the dorsal side of the embryo begin to change shape and form the neural tube when the neural tube does not close completely an ntd develops specific types include spina bifida affects the spine anencephaly results in little to no brain encephalocele affects the skull and iniencephaly which results in severe neck problems  ntds are one of the most common birth defects affecting over 300000 births each year worldwide  for example spina bifida affects approximately 1500 births annually in the usa or about 35 in every 10000 0035 of us births   which has decreased from around 5 per 10000 005 of us births since folate fortification was started  the number of deaths in the usa each year due to neural tube defects also declined from 1200 before folate fortification was started to 840  there are two types of ntds open which are more common and closed open ntds occur when the brain andor spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or vertebrae back bones examples of open ntds are anencephaly encephaloceles hydranencephaly iniencephaly schizencephaly and spina bifida rarer types of ntds are called closed ntds closed ntds occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin common examples of closed ntds are lipomyelomeningocele lipomeningocele and tethered cord anencephaly without brain is a neural tube defect that occurs when the head end of the neural tube fails to close usually during the 23rd and 26th days of pregnancy resulting in an absence of a major portion of the brain and skull infants born with this condition are born without the main part of the forebrainthe largest part of the cerebrumand are usually blind deaf and unconscious the lack of a functioning cerebrum will ensure that the infant will never gain consciousness infants are either stillborn or usually die within a few hours or days after birth encephaloceles are characterized by protrusions of the brain through the skull that are saclike and covered with membrane they can be a groove down the middle of the upper part of the skull between the forehead and nose or the back of the skull encephaloceles are often obvious and diagnosed immediately sometimes small encephaloceles in the nasal and forehead are undetected httpwwwnindsnihgovdisordersencephalocelesencephaloceleshtm hydranencephaly is a condition in which the cerebral hemispheres are missing and instead filled with sacs of cerebrospinal fluid iniencephaly is a rare neural tube defect that results in extreme bending of the head to the spine the diagnosis can usually be made on antenatal ultrasound scanning but if not will undoubtedly be made immediately after birth because the head is bent backwards and the face looks upwards usually the neck is absent the skin of the face connects directly to the chest and the scalp connects to the upper back the infant will usually not survive more than a few hours spina bifida is further divided into two subclasses spina bifida cystica and spina bifida occulta this includes meningocele and myelomeningocele meningocele is less severe and is characterized by herniation of the meninges but not the spinal cord through the opening in the spinal canal myelomeningocele involves herniation of the meninges as well as the spinal cord through the opening  in this type of neural tube defect the meninges do not herniate through the opening in the spinal canal  it is a common condition occurring in 1020 of otherwise healthy people  by definition spina bifida occulta means hidden split spine  the most frequently seen form of spina bifida occulta is when parts of the bones of the spine called the spinous process and the neural arch appear abnormal on a radiogram and is generally harmless usually the spinal cord and spinal nerves are not involved  the risk of recurrence in those who have a first degree relative eg parent sibling is 510 times greater than that in the general population the genetic risk of recurrence with symptomatic forms of spina bifida occulta is uncertain folate vitamin b9 and vitamin b12 are very important in reducing the occurrences of ntds  folate is required for the production and maintenance of new cells for dna synthesis and rna synthesis folate is needed to carry one carbon groups for methylation and nucleic acid synthesis it has been hypothesized that the early human embryo may be particularly vulnerable to folate deficiency due to differences of the functional enzymes in this pathway during embryogenesis combined with high demand for post translational methylations of the cytoskeleton in neural cells during neural tube closure  failure of posttranslational methylation of the cytoskeleton required for differentiation has been implicated in neural tube defects  vitamin b12 is also an important receptor in the folate biopathway such that studies have shown deficiency in vitamin b12 contributes to risk of ntds as well  importantly a deficiency of folate itself does not cause neural tube defects the association seen between reduced neural tube defects and folic acid supplementation is due to a geneenvironment interaction such as venerability caused by the c677t methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mthfr variant supplementing folic acid during pregnancy reduces the prevalence of ntds by not exposing this otherwise subclinical mutation to aggravating conditions  however it has been found that humans convert folic acid to the needed folate less than 2 as well as previously thought based on rat studies and consumption of leafy green vegetables and legumes may be more reliable as a source of folate and also not increase cancer risk for the mother as is associated with folic acid supplementation  other potential causes can include folate antimetabolites such as methotrexate maternal diabetes maternal obesity mycotoxins in contaminated corn meal arsenic hyperthermia in early development and radiation    studies have shown that both maternal cigarette smoking and maternal exposure to secondhand smoke increased the risk for neural tube defects in offspring a mechanism by which maternal exposure to cigarette smoke could increase ntd risk in offspring is suggested by several studies that show an association between cigarette smoking and elevations of homocysteine levels the study suggests that cigarette smoke including secondhand exposure is not only hazardous to the mother but may also interfere with neural tube closure in the developing embryo  all of the above may act by interference with some aspect of normal folic acid metabolism and folate linked methylation related cellular processes as there are multiple genes of this type associated with neural tube defects  folic acid supplementation reduces the prevalence of neural tube defects by approximately 70 of neural tube defects indicating that 30 are not folatedependent and are due to some cause other than alterations of methylation patterns  multiple other genes related to neural tube defects exist which are candidates for folate insensitive neural tube defects  there are also several syndromes such as meckel syndrome and triploid syndrome which are frequently accompanied by neural tube defects that are assumed to be unrelated to folate metabolism  tests for neural tube defects include ultrasound examination and measurement of maternal serum alphafetoprotein msafp amniotic fluid alphafetoprotein afafp and amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase afache tests are also used to confirming if ultrasound screening indicates a positive risk  often these defects are apparent at birth but occult defects may not be diagnosed until much later in life an elevated msafp measured at 1618 weeks gestation is a good predictor of open neural tube defects however the test has a very high false positive rate 2 of all women tested in ontario canada between 1993 and 2000 tested positive without having an open neural tube defect although 5 is the commonly quoted result worldwide and only a portion of neural tube defects are detected by this screen test 73 in the same ontario study  msafp screening combined with routine ultrasonography has the best detection rate although detection by ultrasonography is dependent on operator training and the quality of the equipment   in 1996 the united states food and drug administration published regulations requiring the addition of folic acid to enriched breads cereals flour and other grain products  it is important to note that during the first four weeks of pregnancy when most women do not even realize that they are pregnant adequate folate intake is essential for proper operation of the neurulation process therefore women who could become pregnant are advised to eat foods fortified with folic acid or take supplements in addition to eating folaterich foods to reduce the risks of serious birth defects    in canada mandatory fortification of selected foods with folic acid has been shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by 46  women who may become pregnant are advised to get 400 micrograms of folic acid daily women who are pregnant should receive 10mg 1000 mcg and women who have previously given birth to a child with a neural tube defect should get 40mg50mg in the ukmg daily  treatments of ntds depends on the severity of the complication no treatment is available for anencephaly and infants usually do not survive more than a few hours aggressive surgical management has improved survival and the functions of infants with spina bifida meningoceles and mild myelomeningoceles the success of surgery often depends on the amount of brain tissue involved in the encephalocele the goal of treatment for ntds is to allow the individual to achieve the highest level of function and independence fetal surgery in utero before 26 weeks gestation has been performed with some hope that there is benefit to the final outcome including a reduction in arnoldchiari malformation and thereby decreases the need for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt but the procedure is very high risk for both mother and baby and is considered extremely invasive with questions that the positive outcomes may be due to ascertainment bias and not true benefit further this surgery is not a cure for all problems associated with a neural tube defect other areas of research include tissue engineering and stem cell therapy but this research has not been used in humans  neural tube defects resulted in 71000 deaths globally in 2010

V cerebral palsy cp is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood signs and symptoms vary between people often symptoms include poor coordination stiff muscles weak muscles and tremors there may be problems with sensation vision hearing swallowing and speaking often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over sit crawl or walk as early as other children their age difficulty with the ability to think or reason and seizures each occurs in about one third of people with cp while the symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life the underlying problems do not worsen over time  cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement balance and posture   most often the problems occur during pregnancy however they may also occur during childbirth or shortly after birth often the cause is unknown risk factors include premature birth being a twin certain infections during pregnancy such as toxoplasmosis or rubella exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy a difficult delivery and head trauma during the first few years of life among others  about 2 of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause  a number of subtypes are classified based on the specific problems present for example those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy those with poor coordination have ataxic cerebral palsy and those with writhing movements have athetoid cerebral palsy diagnosis is based on the childs development over time blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes  cp is partly preventable through immunization of the mother and efforts to prevent head injuries in children such as through improved safety there is no cure for cp however supportive treatments medications and surgery may help many individuals this may include physical therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy medications such as diazepam baclofen and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves often external braces and other assistive technology are helpful some children have near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment while alternative medicines are frequently used there is no evidence to support their use  cp is the most common movement disorder in children  it occurs in about 21 per 1000 live births  cerebral palsy has been documented throughout history with the first known descriptions occurring in the work of hippocrates in the 5th century bce extensive study of the condition began in the 19th century by william john little after whom it was called little disease  william osler first named it cerebral palsy from the german zerebrale kinderlähmung cerebral childparalysis  a number of potential treatments are being examined including stem cell therapy however more research is required to determine if it is effective and safe  cerebral palsy is defined as a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation that are attributed to nonprogressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain  while the central feature of cp is a disorder with movement difficulties with thinking learning feeling communication and behavior often occur along with cerebral palsy  of those with cp 28 have epilepsy 58 have difficulties with communication at least 42 have problems with their vision and 2356 have learning disabilities  cerebral palsy is characterized by abnormal muscle tone reflexes or motor development and coordination there can be joint and bone deformities and contractures permanently fixed tight muscles and joints the classical symptoms are spasticity spasms other involuntary movements eg facial gestures unsteady gait problems with balance andor soft tissue findings consisting largely of decreased muscle mass scissor walking where the knees come in and cross and toe walking which can contribute to a gait reminiscent of a marionette are common among people with cp who are able to walk but taken on the whole cp symptomatology is very diverse the effects of cerebral palsy fall on a continuum of motor dysfunction which may range from slight clumsiness at the mild end of the spectrum to impairments so severe that they render coordinated movement virtually impossible at the other end of the spectrum babies born with severe cp often have an irregular posture their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff birth defects such as spinal curvature a small jawbone or a small head sometimes occur along with cp symptoms may appear or change as a child gets older some babies born with cp do not show obvious signs right away classically cp becomes evident when the baby reaches the developmental stage at 6 2 to 9 months and is starting to mobilise where preferential use of limbs asymmetry or gross motor developmental delay is seen  resulting conditions can include seizures apraxia dysarthria or other communication disorders eating problems sensory impairments intellectual disability learning disabilities urinary incontinence fecal incontinence andor behavioural disorders  speech and language disorders are common in people with cerebral palsy the incidence of dysarthria is estimated to range from 31 to 88  speech problems are associated with poor respiratory control laryngeal and velopharyngeal dysfunction and oral articulation disorders that are due to restricted movement in the oralfacial muscles there are three major types of dysarthria in cerebral palsy spastic dyskinetic athetosis and ataxic  overall language delay is associated with problems of intellectual disability hearing loss and learned helplessness  children with cerebral palsy are at risk of learned helplessness and becoming passive communicators initiating little communication  early intervention with this clientele and their parents often targets situations in which children communicate with others so that they learn that they can control people and objects in their environment through this communication including making choices decisions and mistakes  in order for bones to attain their normal shape and size they require the stresses from normal musculature osseous findings will therefore mirror the specific muscular deficits in a given person with cp the shafts of the bones are often thin gracile and become thinner during growth when compared to these thin shafts diaphyses the centres metaphyses often appear quite enlarged ballooning with lack of use articular cartilage may atrophy leading to narrowed joint spaces depending on the degree of spasticity a person with cp may exhibit a variety of angular joint deformities because vertebral bodies need vertical gravitational loading forces to develop properly spasticity and an abnormal gait can hinder proper andor full bone and skeletal development people with cp tend to be shorter in height than the average person because their bones are not allowed to grow to their full potential sometimes bones grow to different lengths so the person may have one leg longer than the other  pain is common and may result from the inherent deficits associated with the condition along with the numerous procedures children typically face  pain is associated with tight or shortened muscles abnormal posture stiff joints unsuitable orthosis etc there is also a high likelihood of chronic sleep disorders secondary to both physical and environmental factors  those with cp may have difficulty preparing food holding utensils or chewing and swallowing due to sensory and motor impairments an infant with cp may not be able to suck swallow or chew  children with cp may have too little or too much sensitivity around and in the mouth  fine finger dexterity like that needed for picking up a utensil is more frequently impaired than gross manual dexterity like that needed for spooning food onto a plate   grip strength impairments are less common   cerebral palsy is due to damage occurring to the developing brain  this damage can occur during pregnancy delivery the first month of life or less commonly in early childhood  structural problems in the brain are seen in 80 of cases most commonly within the white matter  more than three quarters of cases are believed to result from issues that occur during pregnancy  while in certain cases there is no identifiable cause typical causes include problems in intrauterine development eg exposure to radiation infection fetal growth restriction hypoxia of the brain thrombotic events placental conditions birth trauma during labor and delivery and complications around birth or during childhood   between 40 and 50 of all children who develop cerebral palsy were born prematurely  most of these cases 7590 are believed to be due to issues that occur around the time of birth often just after birth  multiplebirth infants are also more likely than singlebirth infants to have cp  they are also more likely to be born with a low birth weight in those who are born with a weight between 1kg and 15kg cp occurs in 6  among those born before 28weeks of gestation it occurs in 11  genetic factors are believed to play an important role in prematurity and cerebral palsy generally  while in those who are born between 34 and 37weeks the risk is 04 three times normal  in babies that are born at term risk factors include problems with the placenta birth defects low birthweight breathing meconium into the lungs a delivery requiring either the use of instruments or an emergency caesarean section birth asphyxia seizures just after birth respiratory distress syndrome low blood sugar and infections in the baby  as of 2013  it was unclear how much of a role birth asphyxia plays as a cause  it is believed however that only a small number of cases are caused by lack of oxygen during birth  it is unclear if the size of the placenta plays a role as of 2015  it is evident that in advantaged countries most cases of cerebral palsy in term or nearterm neonates have explanations other than asphyxia  about 2 of all cp cases are inherited with glutamate decarboxylase1 being one of the possible enzymes involved  most inherited cases are autosomal recessive  meaning both parents must be carriers for the disorder in order to have a child with the disorder after birth other causes include toxins severe jaundice lead poisoning physical brain injury stroke  shaken baby syndrome incidents involving hypoxia to the brain such as near drowning and encephalitis or meningitis the three most common causes of asphyxia in the young child are choking on foreign objects such as toys and pieces of food poisoning and near drowning  infections in the mother even infections that are not easily detected may triple the risk of the child developing the disorder  infections of the fetal membranes known as chorioamnionitis increases the risk  intrauterine and neonatal insults many of which are infectious in nature increase the risk  it has been hypothesised that some cases of cerebral palsy are caused by the death in very early pregnancy of an identical twin  the diagnosis of cerebral palsy has historically rested on the persons history and physical examination a general movements assessment which involves measuring movements that occur spontaneously among those less than four months of age appears to be most accurate   it is a developmental disability  once a person is diagnosed with cerebral palsy further diagnostic tests are optional neuroimaging with ct or mri is warranted when the cause of a persons cerebral palsy has not been established an mri is preferred over ct due to diagnostic yield and safety when abnormal the neuroimaging study can suggest the timing of the initial damage the ct or mri is also capable of revealing treatable conditions such as hydrocephalus porencephaly arteriovenous malformation subdural hematomas and hygromas and a vermian tumour  which a few studies suggest are present 522 of the time furthermore an abnormal neuroimaging study indicates a high likelihood of associated conditions such as epilepsy and intellectual disability  the age at which cp is diagnosed is important but there is disagreement over what is the best age to make the diagnosis  the earlier cp is diagnosed correctly the better the opportunities are to provide the child with physical and educational help but there also might be a greater chance that cp will be confused with another problem especially if the child is 18 months of age or younger  infants may have temporary problems with muscle tone or control that can be confused with cp which is permanent  a metabolism disorder or tumors in the nervous system may also appear to be cp and metabolic disorders in particular can produce brain problems that look like cp on an mri  disorders that deteriorate the white matter in the brain and certain kinds of problems that cause spasms and weakness in the legs may also be mistaken for cp when they first appear early in life  however these disorders get worse over time and cp does not  although it may change in character  in infancy it may not be possible to tell the difference between them  fragile x syndrome a cause of autism and intellectual disability and general intellectual disability must also be ruled out  cerebral palsy specialist john mclaughlin recommends waiting until the child is 36 months of age before making a diagnosis  cp is classified by the types of motor impairment of the limbs or organs and by restrictions to the activities an affected person may perform  there are three main cp classifications by motor impairment spastic ataxic and athetoiddyskinetic additionally there is a mixed type that shows a combination of features of the other types these classifications also reflect the areas of the brain that are damaged spastic cerebral palsy or cerebral palsy where spasticity muscle tightness is the exclusive or almostexclusive impairment present is by far the most common type of overall cerebral palsy occurring in upwards of 70 of all cases  people with this type of cp are hypertonic and have what is essentially a neuromuscular mobility impairment rather than hypotonia or paralysis stemming from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain as well as the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex this damage impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to receive gammaaminobutyric acid properly leading to hypertonia in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves  as compared to other types of cp and especially as compared to hypotonic or paralytic mobility disabilities spastic cp is typically more easily manageable by the person affected and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopedic and neurological fronts throughout life in any form of spastic cp clonus of the affected limbs may sometimes result as well as muscle spasms resulting from the pain andor stress of the tightness experienced the spasticity can and usually does also lead to very early onset of musclestress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid20s and early30s occupational therapy and physical therapy regimens of assisted stretching strengthening functional tasks andor targeted physical activity and exercise are usually the chief ways to keep spastic cp wellmanaged although if the spasticity is too much for the person to handle other remedies may be considered such as various antispasmodic medications botulinum toxin baclofen or even a neurosurgery known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy which eliminates the spasticity by eliminating the nerves causing it  ataxiatype symptoms can be caused by damage to the cerebellum ataxia is a less common type of cerebral palsy occurring between 5 and 10 of all cases  some of these individuals have hypotonia and tremors motor skills such as writing typing or using scissors might be affected as well as balance especially while walking it is common for individuals to have difficulty with visual andor auditory processing they usually have an awkward gait and as well with some dysarthria  athetoid cerebral palsy or dyskinetic cerebral palsy is mixed muscle tone both hypertonia and hypotonia mixed with involuntary motions people with dyskinetic cp have trouble holding themselves in an upright steady position for sitting or walking and often show involuntary motions for some people with dyskinetic cp it takes a lot of work and concentration to get their hand to a certain spot like scratching their nose or reaching for a cup because of their mixed tone and trouble keeping a position they may not be able to hold onto objects especially small ones requiring fine motor control such as a toothbrush or pencil about 10 of individuals with cp are classified as dyskinetic cp but some have mixed forms with spasticity and dyskinesia the damage occurs to the extrapyramidal motor system andor pyramidal tract and to the basal ganglia in newborn infants high bilirubin levels in the blood if left untreated can lead to brain damage in the basal ganglia kernicterus which can lead to dyskinetic cerebral palsy  mixed cerebral palsy is symptoms of athetoid ataxic and spastic cp appearing simultaneously each to varying degrees and both with and without certain symptoms of each mixed cp is the most difficult to treat as it is extremely heterogeneous and sometimes unpredictable in its symptoms and development over the lifespan  electronic fetal monitoring has not helped to prevent cp and in 2014 the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists the royal australian and new zealand college of obstetricians and gynaecologists and the society of obstetricians and gynaecologists of canada have acknowledged that there are no longterm benefits of electronic fetal monitoring  in those at risk of an early delivery magnesium sulphate appears to decrease the risk of cerebral palsy   it is unclear if it helps those who are born at term  cooling highrisk fullterm babies shortly after birth may reduce disability  over time the approach to cp management has shifted away from narrow attempts to fix individual physical problems  such as spasticity in a particular limb  to making such treatments part of a larger goal of maximizing the persons independence and community engagement   however the evidence base for the effectiveness of intervention programs reflecting this philosophy has not yet caught up effective interventions for body structures and functions have a strong evidence base but evidence is lacking for effective interventions targeted toward participation environment or personal factors  there is also no good evidence to show that an intervention that is effective at the bodyspecific level will result in an improvement at the activity level or vice versa  although such crossover benefit might happen not enough highquality studies have been done to demonstrate it  treatment of cerebral palsy is a lifelong process focused on the management of associated conditions it tries to allow healthy development on all levels the brain up to about the age of 8 is not set and has the ability to reroute many signal paths that may have been affected by the initial trauma the earlier it has help in doing this the more successful it will be  the treatments with the best evidence are medications anticonvulsants botulinum toxin bisphosphonates diazepam therapy bimanual training casting constraintinduced movement therapy contextfocused therapy fitness training goaldirected training hip surveillance home programmes occupational therapy after botulinum toxin pressure care and surgery selective dorsal rhizotomy  various forms of therapy are available to people living with cerebral palsy as well as caregivers and parents treatment may include one or more of the following physical therapy occupational therapy speech therapy water therapy drugs to control seizures alleviate pain or relax muscle spasms eg benzodiazepines surgery to correct anatomical abnormalities or release tight muscles braces and other orthotic devices rolling walkers and communication aids such as computers with attached voice synthesisers  however there is only some benefit from therapy treatment is usually symptomatic and focuses on helping the person to develop as many motor skills as possible or to learn how to compensate for the lack of them nonspeaking people with cp are often successful availing themselves of augmentative and alternative communication  physiotherapy programs are designed to encourage the patient to build a strength base for improved gait and volitional movement together with stretching programs to limit contractures many experts  believe that lifelong physiotherapy is crucial to maintain muscle tone bone structure and prevent dislocation of the joints  speech therapy helps control the muscles of the mouth and jaw and helps improve communication just as cp can affect the way a person moves their arms and legs it can also affect the way they move their mouth face and head this can make it hard for the person to breathe talk clearly and bite chew and swallow food speech therapy often starts before a child begins school and continues throughout the school years  conductive education ce was developed in hungary from 1945 based on the work of andrás pet\u0151 it is a unified system of rehabilitation for people with neurological disorders including cerebral palsy parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis amongst other conditions it is theorised to improve mobility selfesteem stamina and independence as well as daily living skills and social skills the conductor is the professional who delivers ce in partnership with parents and children skills learned during ce should be applied to everyday life and can help to develop ageappropriate cognitive social and emotional skills it is available at specialised centres  biofeedback is a therapy in which people learn how to control their affected muscles biofeedback therapy has been found to significantly improve gait in children with cerebral palsy  massage therapy is designed to help relax tense muscles strengthen muscles and keep joints flexible  more research is needed to determine the health benefits of these therapies for people with cp  occupational therapy helps adults and children maximise their function adapt to their limitations and live as independently as possible   a familycentred philosophy is used with children who have cp occupational therapists work closely with families in order to address their concerns and priorities for their child  cp commonly causes hemiplegia  those with hemiplegia have limited use of the limbs on one side of the body and have normal use of the limbs on the other side  hemiplegics often adapt by ignoring the limited limbs and performing nearly all activities with the unaffected limbs which can lead to increased problems with muscle tone motor control and range of motion  an emerging technique called constraintinduced movement therapy cimt is designed to address this  in cimt the unaffected limbs are constrained forcing the individual to learn to use the affected limbs  as of 2007  there was limited preliminary evidence that cimt is effective but more study is needed before it can be recommended with confidence  botulinum toxin injections are given into muscles that are spastic or sometimes dystonic the aim being to reduce the muscle hypertonus that can be painful a reduction in muscle tone can also facilitate bracing and the use of orthotics most often lower extremity muscles are injected botulinum toxin is focal treatment meaning that a limited number of muscles can be injected at the same time the effect of the toxin is reversible and a reinjection is needed every 46 months  in children it decreases spasticity and improve range of motion and thus has become commonly used  surgery usually involves one or a combination of other surgical procedures are available to try to help with other problems those who have serious difficulties with eating may undergo a procedure called a gastrostomy a hole is cut through the belly skin and into the stomach to allow for a feeding tube  there is no good evidence about the effectiveness or safety of gastrostomy  orthotic devices such as anklefoot orthoses afos are often prescribed to achieve the following objectives correct andor prevent deformity provide a base of support facilitate training in skills and improve the efficiency of gait  the available evidence suggests that orthoses can have positive effects on all temporal and spatial parameters of gait ie velocity cadence step length stride length single and double support  afos have also been found to reduce energy expenditure  there are now assitive technologies designed to help when dealing with cerebral palsy most often to aid with meal times there are manual feeding aids for example one designed using viscous fluid damping to smooth out essential tremors associated with cerebral palsy there are also electronic feeding aids on the market suitable for anyone who can chew and swallow but unable to feed themselves there are manual drinking aids available designed with nonreturn valves and holders or non slip surfaces to enable users who lack the ability to drink from a cup or glass due to tremors weakness or limited head mobility to gain a route to hydration and nutrition  hyperbaric oxygen therapy hbot in which pressurised oxygen is inhaled inside a hyperbaric chamber has been studied under the theory that improving oxygen availability to damaged brain cells can reactivate some of them to function normally however hbot results in no significant difference from that of pressurised room air and some children undergoing hbot may experience adverse events such as seizures and the need for ear pressure equalisation tubes  patterning is a controversial form of alternative therapy for people with cp the method is promoted by the institutes for the achievement of human potential iahp a philadelphia nonprofit organisation but has been criticised by the american academy of pediatrics  cp is not a progressive disorder meaning the brain damage does not worsen but the symptoms can become more severe over time a person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood if he or she receives extensive care but once bones and musculature become more established orthopedic surgery may be required the full intellectual potential of a child born with cp will often not be known until the child starts school people with cp are more likely to have learning disabilities although these may be unrelated to iq including varying degrees of intellectual disability intellectual level among people with cp varies from genius to intellectually impaired as it does in the general population and experts have stated that it is important not to underestimate the capabilities of a person with cp and to give them every opportunity to learn  the life expectancy of those with cp is less than that of the general population but has improved with the utilization of modern medicine  the ability to live independently with cp varies widely depending partly on the severity of each persons impairment and partly on the capability of each person to selfmanage the logistics of life some individuals with cp require personal assistant services for all activities of daily living others only need assistance with certain activities and still others do not require any physical assistance but regardless of the severity of a persons physical impairment a persons ability to live independently often depends primarily on the persons capacity to manage the physical realities of his or her life autonomously in some cases people with cp recruit hire and manage a staff of personal care assistants pcas pcas facilitate the independence of their employers by assisting them with their daily personal needs in a way that allows them to maintain control over their lives people with cp can usually expect to have a normal life expectancy survival has been shown to be associated with the ability to ambulate roll and selffeed  as the condition does not affect reproductive function people with cp can have children and parent successfully selfcare is any activity people do to care for themselves for many children with cp parents are heavily involved in selfcare activities selfcare activities such as bathing dressing grooming can be difficult for children with cp as selfcare depends primarily on use of the upper limbs  for those living with cp impaired upper limb function affects almost 50 of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation  as the hands are used for many selfcare tasks sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily selfcare more difficult     motor impairments cause more problems than sensory impairments   the most common impairment is that of finger dexterity which is the ability to manipulate small objects with the fingers   the effects of sensory motor and cognitive impairments affect selfcare occupations in children with cp and productivity occupations productivity can include but is not limited to school work household chores and contributing to the community  play is included as a productive occupation as it is often the primary activity for children  if play becomes difficult due to a disability like cp this can cause problems for the child  these difficulties can affect a childs selfesteem  in addition the sensory and motor problems experienced by children with cp affect how the child interacts with their surroundings including the environment and other people  not only do physical limitations affect a childs ability to play the limitations perceived by the childs caregivers and playmates also impact the childs play activities  some children with disabilities spend more time playing by themselves  when a disability prevents a child from playing there may be social emotional and psychological problems  which can lead to increased dependence on others less motivation and poor social skills  in school students are asked to complete many tasks and activities many of which involve handwriting many children with cp have the capacity to learn and write in the school environment  however students with cp may find it difficult to keep up with the handwriting demands of school and their writing may be difficult to read  in addition writing may take longer and require greater effort on the students part  factors linked to handwriting include postural stability sensory and perceptual abilities of the hand and writing tool pressure  speech impairments may be seen in children with cp depending on the severity of brain damage  communication in a school setting is important because communicating with peers and teachers is very much a part of the school experience and enhances social interaction problems with language or motor dysfunction can lead to underestimating a students intelligence  in summary children with cp may experience difficulties in school such as difficulty with handwriting carrying out school activities communicating verbally and interacting socially leisure occupations are any activities that are done for enjoyment enjoyable activities depend on ones personality and environment leisure activities can have several positive effects on physical health mental health life satisfaction and psychological growth for people with physical disabilities like cp  common benefits identified are stress reduction development of coping skills companionship enjoyment relaxation and a positive effect on life satisfaction  in addition for children with cp leisure appears to enhance adjustment to living with a disability  leisure can be divided into structured formal and unstructured informal activities  studies show that children with disabilities like cp participate mainly in informal activities that are carried out in the family environment and are organised by adults  typically children with disabilities carry out leisure activities by themselves or with their parents rather than with friends therefore children may experience limited diversity of activities and social engagements as well as a more passive lifestyle than their peers  although leisure is important for children with cp they may have difficulties carrying out leisure activities due to social and physical barriers participation is involvement in life situations and everyday activities  participation includes the domains of selfcare productivity and leisure in fact communication mobility education home life leisure and social relationships require participation and are indicators of the extent to which a child functions in his or her environment  barriers can exist on three levels micro meso and macro  first the barriers at the micro level involve the person  barriers at the micro level include the childs physical limitations motor sensory and cognitive impairments or their subjective feelings regarding their ability to participate  for example the child may not participate in group activities due to lack of confidence second barriers at the meso level include the family and community  these may include negative attitudes of people toward disability or lack of support within the family or in the community  one of the main reasons for this limited support appears to be the result of a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the childs ability to engage in activities despite his or her disability  third barriers at the macro level incorporate the systems and policies that are not in place or hinder children with cp these may be environmental barriers to participation such as architectural barriers lack of relevant assistive technology and transportation difficulties due to limited wheelchair access or public transit that can accommodate children with cp  for example a building without an elevator will prevent the child from accessing higher floors cerebral palsy occurs in about 21 per 1000 live births  in those born at term rates are lower at 1 per 1000 live births  rates appear to be similar in both the developing and developed world  within a population it may occur more often in poorer people  the rate is higher in males than in females in europe it is 13 times more common in males  variances in reported rates of incidence or prevalence across different geographical areas in industrialised countries are thought to be caused primarily by discrepancies in the criteria used for inclusion and exclusion when such discrepancies are taken into account in comparing two or more registers of patients with cerebral palsy for example the extent to which children with mild cerebral palsy are included the prevalence rates converge toward the average rate of 21000  overall advances in care of pregnant mothers and their babies has not resulted in a noticeable decrease in cp this is generally attributed to medical advances in areas related to the care of premature babies which results in a greater survival rate only the introduction of quality medical care to locations with lessthanadequate medical care has shown any decreases the incidence of cp increases with premature or very lowweight babies regardless of the quality of care  prevalence of cerebral palsy is best calculated around the school entry age of about 6years the prevalence in the us is estimated to be 24 out of 1000 children  cerebral palsy has affected humans since antiquity a decorated grave marker dating from around the 15th to 14th century bce shows a figure with one small leg and using a crutch possibly due to cerebral palsy the oldest likely physical evidence of the condition comes from the mummy of siptah an egyptian pharaoh who ruled from about 1196 to 1190bce and died at about 20 years of age the presence of cerebral palsy has been suspected due to his deformed foot and hands  the medical literature of the ancient greeks discusses paralysis and weakness of the arms and legs the modern word palsy comes from the ancient greek words \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 or \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 meaning paralysis or paresis respectively the works of the school of hippocrates 460c 370bce and the manuscript on the sacred disease in particular describe a group of problems that matches up very well with the modern understanding of cerebral palsy the roman emperor claudius 10 bce54 ce is suspected of having cp as historical records describe him as having several physical problems in line with the condition medical historians have begun to suspect and find depictions of cp in much later art several paintings from the 16th century and later show individuals with problems consistent with it such as jusepe de riberas 1642 painting the clubfoot  the modern understanding of cp as resulting from problems within the brain began in the early decades of the 1800s with a number of publications on brain abnormalities by johann christian reil claude françois lallemand and philippe pinel later physicians used this research to connect problems in the brain with specific symptoms the english surgeon william john little 18101894 was the first person to study cp extensively in his doctoral thesis he stated that cp was a result of a problem around the time of birth he later identified a difficult delivery a preterm birth and perinatal asphyxia in particular as risk factors the spastic diplegia form of cp came to be known as littles disease in the 1880s british neurologist william gowers built on littles work by linking paralysis in newborns to difficult births he named the problem birth palsy and classified birth palsies into two types peripheral and cerebral  working in pennsylvania in the 1880s canadianborn physician william osler 18491919 reviewed dozens of cp cases to further classify the disorders by the site of the problems on the body and by the underlying cause osler made further observations tying problems around the time of delivery with cp and concluded that problems causing bleeding inside the brain were likely the root cause osler also suspected polioencephalitis as an infectious cause through the 1890s scientists commonly confused cp with polio  before moving to psychiatry austrian neurologist sigmund freud 18561939 made further refinements to the classification of the disorder he produced the system still being used today freuds system divides the causes of the disorder into problems present at birth problems that develop during birth and problems after birth freud also made a rough correlation between the location of the problem inside the brain and the location of the affected limbs on the body and documented the many kinds of movement disorders  in the early 20th century the attention of the medical community generally turned away from cp until orthopedic surgeon winthrop phelps became the first physician to treat the disorder he viewed cp from a musculoskeletal perspective instead of a neurological one phelps developed surgical techniques for operating on the muscles to address issues such as spasticity and muscle rigidity hungarian physical rehabilitation practitioner andrás pet\u0151 developed a system to teach children with cp how to walk and perform other basic movements pet\u0151s system became the foundation for conductive education widely used for children with cp today through the remaining decades physical therapy for cp has evolved and has become a core component of the cp management program  in 1997 robert palisano et al introduced the gross motor function classification system gmfcs as an improvement over the previous rough assessment of limitation as either mild moderate or severe  the gmfcs grades limitation based on observed proficiency in specific basic mobility skills such as sitting standing and walking and takes into account the level of dependency on aids such as wheelchairs or walkers the gmfcs was further revised and expanded in 2007  access economics has released a report on the economic impact of cerebral palsy in australia launched by the hon bill shorten mp the report found that in 2007 the financial cost of cerebral palsy cp in australia was 147billion or 014 of gdp  of this the value of lost wellbeing disability and premature death was a further 24billion in per capita terms this amounts to a financial cost of 43431 per person with cp per annum including the value of lost wellbeing the cost is over 115000 per person per annum individuals with cp bear 37 of the financial costs and their families and friends bear a further 6 federal government bears around one third 33 of the financial costs mainly through taxation revenues forgone and welfare payments state governments bear under 1 of the costs while employers bear 5 and the rest of society bears the remaining 19 if the burden of disease lost wellbeing is included individuals bear 76 of the costs the average lifetime cost for people with cp in the us is 921000 per individual including lost income  in the united states many states allow medicaid beneficiaries to use their medicaid funds to hire their own pcas instead of forcing them to use institutional or managed care  in india the government sponsored program called niramaya for the medical care of children with neurological and muscular deformities has proved to be an ameliorating economic measure for persons with such disabilities it has been seen that persons with mental or physically debilitating congenital disabilities can lead better lives if they have financial independence in cases of financial penury such persons face extreme living conditions the term palsy in modern language refers to disorder of movement but the word root palsy technically means paralysis even though it is not used as such within the meaning of cerebral palsy the use of palsy in the term cerebral palsy makes it important to note that paralytic disorders are in fact not cerebral palsy meaning that the condition of tetraplegia which comes from spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury should not be confused with spastic quadriplegia which doesnt nor should tardive dyskinesia be confused with dyskinetic cerebral palsy or the condition of paralytic diplegia with spastic diplegia in fact as of the early 21st century some clinicians have become so distressed at common incorrect use of these terms that they have resorted to new naming schemes rather than trying to reclaim the classic ones one such example of this evolution is the increasing use of the term bilateral spasticity to refer to spastic diplegia such clinicians even argue quite often that the new term is technically more clinically accurate than the established term  many people would rather be referred to as a person with a disability instead of handicapped cerebral palsy a guide for care at the university of delaware offers the following guidelines impairment is the correct term to use to define a deviation from normal such as not being able to make a muscle move or not being able to control an unwanted movement disability is the term used to define a restriction in the ability to perform a normal activity of daily living which someone of the same age is able to perform for example a threeyearold child who is not able to walk has a disability because a normal threeyearold can walk independently a handicapped child or adult is one who because of the disability is unable to achieve the normal role in society commensurate with his age and sociocultural milieu as an example a sixteenyearold who is unable to prepare his own meal or care for his own toilet or hygiene needs is handicapped on the other hand a sixteenyearold who can walk only with the assistance of crutches but who attends a regular school and is fully independent in activities of daily living is disabled but not handicapped all disabled people are impaired and all handicapped people are disabled but a person can be impaired and not necessarily be disabled and a person can be disabled without being handicapped  the term spastic denotes the attribute of spasticity in types of spastic cp in 1952 a uk charity called the spastics society was formed  the term spastics was used by the charity as a term for people with cp the word spastic has since been used extensively as a general insult to disabled people which some see as extremely offensive they are also frequently used to insult ablebodied people when they seem overly uncoordinated anxious or unskilled in sports the charity changed its name to scope in 1994  in the united states the word spaz has the same usage as an insult but is not generally associated with cp  it is not taken as derogatory in the indian context rather spasticity and cerebral palsy are used interchangeably the term is widely used to connote cerebral palsy and is accepted for usage in medical fraternity as well as in social life many organisations known as spastic societies viz spastic society of gurgaon are working in different areas in india as charitable bodies for people with cerebral palsy in caretaking rehabilitation and medical support of children with neurological muscular development disabilities maverick documentary filmmaker kazuo hara criticises the mores and customs of japanese society in an unsentimental portrait of adults with cerebral palsy in his 1972 film goodbye cp sayonara cp focusing on how the cp victims are generally ignored or disregarded in japan hara challenges his societys taboos about physical handicaps using a deliberately harsh style with grainy blackandwhite photography and outofsync sound hara brings a stark realism to his subject  spandan 2012 a film by vegitha reddy and aman tripathi delves into the dilemma of parents whose child suffers from cerebral palsy while films made with children with special needs as central characters have been attempted before the predicament of parents dealing with the stigma associated with condition and beyond is dealt in spandan in one of the songs of spandan chal chaal chaal tu bala more than 50 cp kids have acted the famous classical singer devaki pandit has given her voice to the song penned by prof jayant dhupkar and composed by national film awards winner isaac thomas kottukapally     my left foot 1989 is a drama film directed by jim sheridan and starring daniel daylewis it tells the true story of christy brown an irishman born with cerebral palsy who could control only his left foot christy brown grew up in a poor workingclass family and became a writer and artist it won the academy award for best actor daniel daylewis and best actress in a supporting role brenda fricker it was also nominated for best director best picture and best writing screenplay based on material from another medium it also won the new york film critics circle award for best film for 1989  call the midwife 2012 has featured two episodes with actor colin young who he himself has cerebral palsy playing a character with the same disability his story lines have focused on the segregation of those with disabilities in the uk in the 1950s and also romantic relationships between people with disabilities  stem cell therapy is being studied as a treatment  a potential treatment for some forms of cerebral palsy may be deep brain stimulation  as of 2015  it is thought that research in genetics and genomics teratology and developmental neuroscience is going to yield greater understanding of cerebral palsy

V a persistent cloaca is a complex anorectal congenital disorder in which the rectum vagina and urinary tract meet and fuse creating a cloaca a single common channel    diagnosis of a female with cloaca should be suspected in a female born with an imperforate anus and small looking genitalia the diagnosis can be made clinically failure to identify a cloaca as being present in a newborn may be dangerous as more than 90 have associated urological problems the goal for treatment of a female born with cloaca is to achieve bowel control urinary control and sexual function which includes menstruation sexual intercourse and possibly pregnancy cloacas probably occur in 1 in 20000 live births   cloacas appear in a wide spectrum of variation in females born with the malformation the single orifice called a common channel may occur varying in length from 1 to 10cm the length of the common channel can be used to judge prognostic outcomes and technical challenges during surgical repair a common channel less than 3cm in length usually has good sphincter muscles and a welldeveloped sacrum the prognostic outcomes for this type of cloaca are good for bowel control and urinary function the surgical repair for this type of cloaca can usually be done by performing posterior sagittal approach without opening of the abdomen a common channel longer than 3cm in length usually has poor sphincter muscles and a poor sacrum suggesting a prognostic outcome for bowel control and urinary function to be less likely common channels longer than 3cm are generally considered more complex and more technically challenging in surgical repair

V environmental toxins and fetal development is the impact of different toxins from the environment on the development of the fetus this article deals with potential adverse effects of environmental toxins on the prenatal development of both the embryo or fetus as well as pregnancy complications the human embryo or fetus is relatively susceptible to impact from adverse conditions within the mothers environment subpar fetal conditions often cause various degrees of developmental delays both physical and mental for the growing baby although some variables do occur as a result of genetic conditions pertaining to the father a great many are directly brought about from environmental toxins that the mother is exposed to various toxins pose a significant hazard to fetuses during development a 2011 study found that virtually all us pregnant women carry multiple chemicals including some banned since the 1970s in their bodies researchers detected polychlorinated biphenyls organochlorine pesticides perfluorinated compounds phenols polybrominated diphenyl ethers phthalates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons perchlorate pbdes compounds used as flame retardants and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt a pesticide banned in the united states in 1972 in the bodies of 99 to 100 percent of the pregnant women they tested bisphenol a bpa was identified in 96 percent of the women surveyed several of the chemicals were at the same concentrations that have been associated with negative effects in children from other studies and it is thought that exposure to multiple chemicals can have a greater impact than exposure to only one substance    environmental toxins can be described separately by what effects they have such as structural abnormalities altered growth functional deficiencies congenital neoplasia or even death for the fetus  one in ten us babies is born preterm and about 5 have low birth weight preterm birth defined as birth at less than 37 weeks of gestation is a major basis of infant mortality throughout childhood exposures to environmental toxins such as lead tobacco smoke and ddt have been linked with an increased risk for spontaneous abortion low birth weight or preterm birth  toxic substances that are capable of causing structural congenital abnormalities can be termed teratogens  they are agents extrinsic to embryo or fetus which exert deleterious effects leading to increased risk of malformation carcinogenesis mutagenesis altered function deficient growth or pregnancy wastage  teratogens are classified in four main categories teratogens affect the fetus by various mechanism including neuroplastic effects of pollution can give rise to neurodevelopmental disorders many cases of autism are related to particular geographic locations implying that something in the environment is complementing an atrisk genotype to cause autism in vulnerable individuals these findings regarding autism are controversial however with many researchers believing that increasing rates in certain areas are a consequence of more accurate screening and diagnostic methods and are not due to any sort of environmental factor  substances which have been found to be particularly harmful are lead which is stored in the mothers bones cigarette smoke mercury a neurological toxicant consumed through fish carbon dioxide and ionizing radiation  children exposed to prenatal tobacco smoke may experience a wide range of behavioral neurological and physical difficulties  adverse effects include stillbirth placental disruption prematurity lower mean birth weight physical birth defects cleft palate etc decrements in lung function increased risk of infant mortality  elemental mercury and methylmercury are two forms of mercury that may pose risks of mercury poisoning in pregnancy methylmercury a worldwide contaminant of seafood and freshwater fish is known to produce adverse nervous system effects especially during brain development eating fish is the main source of mercury exposure in humans and some fish may contain enough mercury to harm the developing nervous system of an embryo or fetus sometimes leading to learning disabilities  mercury is present in many types of fish but it is mostly found in certain large fish one welldocumented case of widespread mercury ingestion and subsequent fetal development complication took place in the 1950s in minimata bay japan used by a nearby industrial plant in the manufacture of plastics methyl mercury was discharged into the waters of minimata bay where it went on to be ingested regularly by many villagers who used the fish living in the bay as a dietary staple soon many of the inhabitants who had been consuming the mercuryladen meat began experiencing negative effects from ingesting the toxin however the mercury especially impacted pregnant women and their fetuses resulting in a high rate of miscarriage surviving infants exposed to mercury inutero had extremely high rates of physical and mental handicaps as well as physical abnormalities from exposure in the womb during key stages in fetal physical development   the united states food and drug administration and the environmental protection agency advise pregnant women not to eat swordfish shark king mackerel and tilefish and limit consumption of albacore tuna to 6 ounces or less a week  high mercury levels in newborns in gaza are theorized to originate from war weaponry  mercury exposure in pregnancy may also cause limb defects  adverse effects of lead exposure in pregnancy include miscarriage low birth weight neurological delays anemia encephalopathy paralysis blindness   the developing nervous system of the fetus is particularly vulnerable to lead toxicity neurological toxicity is observed in children of exposed women as a result of the ability of lead to cross the placental barrier a special concern for pregnant women is that some of the bone lead accumulation is released into the blood during pregnancy several studies have provided evidence that even low maternal exposures to lead produce intellectual and behavioral deficits in children  dioxins and dioxinlike compounds persists in the environment for a long time and are widespread so all people have some amount of dioxins in the body intrauterine exposure to dioxins and dioxinlike compounds have been associated with subtle developmental changes on the fetus effects on the child later in life include changes in liver function thyroid hormone levels white blood cell levels and decreased performance in tests of learning and intelligence  air pollution can negatively affect a pregnancy resulting in higher rates of preterm births growth restriction and heart and lung problems in the infant  compounds such as carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide all have the potential to cause serious damage when inhaled by an expecting mother  low birth weight preterm birth intrauterine growth retardation and congenital abnormalities have all been found to be associated with fetal exposure to air pollution  although pollution can be found virtually everywhere there are specific sources that have been known to release toxic substances and should be avoided if possible by those who wish to remain relatively free of toxins these substances include but are not limited to steel mills wastewater treatment plants sewage incinerators automotive fabrication plants oil refineries and chemical manufacturing plants  control of air pollution can be difficult for example in los angeles regulations have been made to control pollution by putting rules on industrial and vehicle emissions improvements have been made to meet these regulations despite these improvements the region still does not meet federal standards for ozone and particulate matter approximately 150000 births occur every year in los angeles thus any effects air pollution has on human development in utero are of great concern to those who live in this region  pesticides are created for the specific purpose of causing harm to insects rodents and other pests pesticides have the potential to serious damages to a developing fetus should they be introduced into the fetal environment studies have shown that pesticides particularly fungicides have shown up in analyses of infants cord blood proving that such toxins are indeed transferred into the babys body  overall the two pesticides most frequently detected in cord blood are diethyltolaumide  a commonly used repellant and vinclozolin a fungicide  although pesticide toxicity is not as frequently mentioned as some of the other methods of environmental toxicity such as air pollution contamination can occur at any time from merely engaging in everyday activities such as walking down a pathway near a contaminated area or eating foods that have not been washed properly  in 2007 alone 11 billion pounds of pesticides were found present in the environment causing pesticide exposure to gain notoriety as a new cause of caution to those wishing to preserve their health  the american college of nursemidwives recommends the following precautions to minimize exposure to relevant environmental toxins in pregnancy  the healthy placenta is a semipermeable membrane that does form a barrier for most pathogens and for certain xenobiotic substances however it is by design an imperfect barrier since it must transport substances required for growth and development placental transport can be by passive diffusion for smaller molecules that are lipid soluble or by active transport for substances that are larger andor electrically charged some toxic chemicals may be actively transported the dose of a substance received by the fetus is determined by the amount of the substance transported across the placenta as well as the rate of metabolism and elimination of the substance as the fetus has an immature metabolism it is unable to detoxify substances very efficiently and as the placenta plays such an important role in substance exchange between the mother and the fetus it goes without saying that any toxic substances that the mother is exposed to are transported to the fetus where they can then affect development carbondioxide lead ethanol alcohol and cigarette smoke in particular are all substances that have a high likelihood of placental transferral  identifying potential hazards for fetal development requires a basis of scientific information in 2004 brent proposed a set of criteria for identifying causes of congenital malformations that also are applicable to developmental toxicity in general those criteria are

V pes cavus in medical terminology also high instep high arch talipes cavus cavoid foot and supinated foot type is a human foot type in which the sole of the foot is distinctly hollow when bearing weight that is there is a fixed plantar flexion of the foot a high arch is the opposite of a flat foot and is somewhat less common   the term pes cavus is latin for hollow foot and is synonymous with the terms talipes cavus cavoid foot higharched foot and supinated foot type pes cavus is a multiplanar foot deformity characterised by an abnormally high medial longitudinal arch pes cavus commonly features a varus inverted hindfoot a plantarflexed position of the first metatarsal an adducted forefoot and dorsal contracture of the toes despite numerous anecdotal reports and hypothetical descriptions very little rigorous scientific data exist on the assessment or treatment of pes cavus  the term pes cavus encompasses a broad spectrum of foot deformities three main types of pes cavus are regularly described in the literature pes cavovarus pes calcaneocavus and pure pes cavus the three types of pes cavus can be distinguished by their aetiology clinical signs and radiological appearance   pes cavovarus the most common type of pes cavus is seen primarily in neuromuscular disorders such as charcotmarietooth disease and in cases of unknown aetiology is conventionally termed idiopathic  pes cavovarus presents with the calcaneus in varus the first metatarsal plantarflexed and a clawtoe deformity  radiological analysis of pes cavus in charcotmarietooth disease shows the forefoot is typically plantarflexed in relation to the rearfoot  in the pes calcaneocavus foot which is seen primarily following paralysis of the triceps surae due to poliomyelitis the calcaneus is dorsiflexed and the forefoot is plantarflexed  radiological analysis of pes calcaneocavus reveals a large talocalcaneal angle in pure pes cavus the calcaneus is neither dorsiflexed nor in varus and is highly arched due to a plantarflexed position of the forefoot on the rearfoot  a combination of any or all of these elements can also be seen in a combined type of pes cavus that may be further categorized as flexible or rigid  despite various presentations and descriptions of pes cavus all incarnations are characterised by an abnormally high medial longitudinal arch gait disturbances and resultant foot pathology there are few good estimates of prevalence for pes cavus in the general community while pes cavus has been reported in between 2 and 29 of the adult population there are several limitations of the prevalence data reported in these studies  populationbased studies suggest the prevalence of the cavus foot is approximately 10  pes cavus may be hereditary or acquired and the underlying cause may be neurological orthopedic or neuromuscular pes cavus is sometimesbut not alwaysconnected through hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 1 charcotmarietooth disease and friedreichs ataxia many other cases of pes cavus are natural the cause and deforming mechanism underlying pes cavus is complex and not well understood factors considered influential in the development of pes cavus include muscle weakness and imbalance in neuromuscular disease residual effects of congenital clubfoot posttraumatic bone malformation contracture of the plantar fascia and shortening of the achilles tendon  among the cases of neuromuscular pes cavus 50 have been attributed to charcotmarietooth disease  which is the most common type of inherited neuropathy with an incidence of 1 per 2500 persons affected  also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy hmsn it is genetically heterogeneous and usually presents in the first decade of life with delayed motor milestones distal muscle weakness clumsiness and frequent falls by adulthood charcotmarietooth disease can cause painful foot deformities such as pes cavus although it is a relatively common disorder affecting the foot and ankle little is known about the distribution of muscle weakness severity of orthopaedic deformities or types of foot pain experienced there are no cures or effective courses of treatment to halt the progression of any form of charcotmarietooth disease  the development of the cavus foot structure seen in charcotmarietooth disease has been previously linked to an imbalance of muscle strength around the foot and ankle a hypothetical model proposed by various authors describes a relationship whereby weak evertor muscles are overpowered by stronger invertor muscles causing an adducted forefoot and inverted rearfoot similarly weak dorsiflexors are overpowered by stronger plantarflexors causing a plantarflexed first metatarsal and anterior pes cavus  pes cavus is also evident in people without neuropathy or other neurological deficit in the absence of neurological congenital or traumatic causes of pes cavus the remaining cases are classified as being idiopathic because their aetiology is unknown  as with certain cases of flat feet high arches may be painful due to metatarsal compression however high arches particularly if they are flexible or properly caredformay be an asymptomatic condition people with pes cavus sometimesthough not alwayshave difficulty finding shoes that fit and may require support in their shoes children with high arches who have difficulty walking may wear speciallydesigned insoles which are available in various sizes and can be made to order individuals with pes cavus frequently report foot pain which can lead to a significant limitation in function the range of complaints reported in the literature include metatarsalgia pain under the first metatarsal plantar fasciitis painful callosities ankle arthritis and achilles tendonitis  there are many other symptoms believed to be related to the cavus foot these include shoefitting problems  lateral ankle instability  lower limb stress fractures  knee pain  iliotibial band friction syndrome  back pain   and tripping  foot pain in people with pes cavus may result from abnormal plantar pressure loading because structurally the cavoid foot is regarded as being rigid and nonshock absorbent and having reduced ground contact area there have previously been reports of an association between excessive plantar pressure and foot pathology in people with pes cavus  surgical treatment is only initiated if there is severe pain as the available operations can be difficult otherwise high arches may be handled with care and proper treatment suggested conservative management of patients with painful pes cavus typically involves strategies to reduce and redistribute plantar pressure loading with the use of foot orthoses and specialised cushioned footwear   other nonsurgical rehabilitation approaches include stretching and strengthening of tight and weak muscles debridement of plantar callosities osseous mobilization massage chiropractic manipulation of the foot and ankle and strategies to improve balance  there are also numerous surgical approaches described in the literature that are aimed at correcting the deformity and rebalancing the foot surgical procedures fall into three main groups

V ethanol \u02c8\u025b\u03b8\u0259n\u0252l also commonly called ethyl alcohol drinking alcohol or simply alcohol is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts it is a neurotoxic   psychoactive drug and one of the oldest recreational drugs used by humans it can cause alcohol intoxication when consumed in sufficient quantity ethanol is a volatile flammable colorless liquid with a slight chemical odor it is used as an antiseptic a solvent a fuel and due to its low freezing point the active fluid in postmercury thermometers its structural formula ch3ch2oh is often abbreviated as c2h5oh c2h6o or etoh ethanol is the systematic name defined by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac for a molecule with two carbon atoms prefix eth having a single bond between them suffix ane and an attached functional groupoh group suffix ol  the prefix ethyl was coined in 1834 by the german chemist justus liebig  ethyl is a contraction of the french word ether any substance that evaporated or sublimated readily at room temperature and the greek word \u03cd\u03bb\u03b7 hyle substance  the name ethanol was coined as a result of a resolution that was adopted at the international conference on chemical nomenclature that was held in april 1892 in geneva switzerland  the term alcohol now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol ultimately a medieval loan from arabic alku\u1e25l  use of alcohol in this sense is modern introduced in the mid 18th century before that time middle latin alcohol referred to powdered ore of antimony powdered cosmetic by the later 17th century any sublimated substance distilled spirit use for the spirit of wine shortened from a full expression alcohol of wine recorded 1753 the systematic use in chemistry dates to 1850 ethanol is a 2carbon alcohol its molecular formula is ch3ch2oh an alternative notation is ch3ch2oh which indicates that the carbon of a methyl group ch3 is attached to the carbon of a methylene group ch2 which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group oh it is a constitutional isomer of dimethyl ether ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as etoh using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group c2h5 with et ethanol is used in medical wipes and in most common antibacterial hand sanitizer gels at a concentration of about 62 vv as an antiseptic ethanol kills organisms by denaturing their proteins and dissolving their lipids and is effective against most bacteria and fungi and many viruses but is ineffective against bacterial spores  ethanol is also widely used clinically and over the counter as an antitussive agent  ethanol may be administered as an antidote to methanol poisoning  ethanol often in surprisingly high concentrations is used to dissolve many waterinsoluble medications and related compounds proprietary liquid preparations of cough and cold remedies analgesics and mouth washes may be dissolved in 1 to 25 concentrations of ethanol and may need to be avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcoholinduced respiratory reactions  ethanol is a central nervous system depressant and has significant psychoactive effects in sublethal doses based on its abilities to alter human consciousness ethanol is considered a psychoactive drug  the amount of ethanol in the body is typically quantified by blood alcohol content bac which is here taken as weight of ethanol per unit volume of blood small doses of ethanol in general produce euphoria and relaxation people experiencing these symptoms tend to become talkative and less inhibited and may exhibit poor judgment at higher dosages bac  1gl ethanol acts as a central nervous system depressant producing at progressively higher dosages impaired sensory and motor function slowed cognition stupefaction unconsciousness and possible death ethanol is commonly consumed as a recreational drug especially while socializing due to its psychoactive effects the largest single use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel additive brazil in particular relies heavily upon the use of ethanol as an engine fuel due in part to its role as the globes leading producer of ethanol  gasoline sold in brazil contains at least 25 anhydrous ethanol hydrous ethanol about 95 ethanol and 5 water can be used as fuel in more than 90 of new gasolineengined cars sold in the country brazilian ethanol is produced from sugar cane and noted for high carbon sequestration  the us uses gasohol max 10 ethanol and e85 85 ethanol ethanolgasoline mixtures ethanol may also be utilized as a rocket fuel and is currently in lightweight rocketpowered racing aircraft  australian law limits the use of pure ethanol sourced from sugarcane waste to up to 10 in automobiles it has been recommended that older cars and vintage cars designed to use a slower burning fuel have their valves upgraded or replaced  according to an industry advocacy group ethanol as a fuel reduces harmful tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide particulate matter oxides of nitrogen and other ozoneforming pollutants  argonne national laboratory analyzed greenhouse gas emissions of many different engine and fuel combinations according to their results biodieselpetrodiesel blend b20 showed a reduction of 8 conventional e85 ethanol blend a reduction of 17 and cellulosic ethanol 64 when compared with pure gasoline  ethanol combustion in an internal combustion engine yields many of the products of incomplete combustion produced by gasoline and significantly larger amounts of formaldehyde and related species such as acetaldehyde  this leads to a significantly larger photochemical reactivity that generates much more ground level ozone  these data have been assembled into the clean fuels report comparison of fuel emissions  and show that ethanol exhaust generates 214times as much ozone as does gasoline exhaust  when this is added into the custom localised pollution index lpi of the clean fuels report the local pollution pollution that contributes to smog is 17 on a scale where gasoline is 10 and higher numbers signify greater pollution  the california air resources board formalized this issue in 2008 by recognizing control standards for formaldehydes as an emissions control group much like the conventional nox and reactive organic gases rogs  world production of ethanol in 2006 was 51 gigalitres 1310 usgal with 69 of the world supply coming from brazil and the united states  more than 20 of brazilian cars are able to use 100 ethanol as fuel which includes ethanolonly engines and flexfuel engines  flexfuel engines in brazil are able to work with all ethanol all gasoline or any mixture of both in the us flexfuel vehicles can run on 0 to 85 ethanol 15 gasoline since higher ethanol blends are not yet allowed or efficient brazil supports this population of ethanolburning automobiles with large national infrastructure that produces ethanol from domestically grown sugar cane sugar cane not only has a greater concentration of sucrose than corn by about 30 but is also much easier to extract the bagasse generated by the process is not wasted but is used in power plants to produce electricity  the united states fuel ethanol industry is based largely on corn according to the renewable fuels association as of 30 october 2007 131 grain ethanol biorefineries in the united states have the capacity to produce 70billion us gallons 26000000m  of ethanol per year an additional 72 construction projects underway in the us can add 64billion us gallons 24000000m  of new capacity in the next 18 months over time it is believed that a material portion of the 150billionusgallon 570000000m  per year market for gasoline will begin to be replaced with fuel ethanol  sweet sorghum is a potential source of ethanol which is suitable for growing in dryland conditions it is being investigated by the international crops research institute for the semiarid tropics icrisat for its potential to provide fuel along with food and animal feed in arid parts of asia and africa  the water requirement of sweet sorghum is onethird that of sugarcane on a comparable time scale also sweet sorghum requires about 22 less water than corn also known as maize the worlds first sweet sorghumbased ethanol production distillery began commercial ethanol production in 2007 in andhra pradesh india  ethanols high miscibility with water means that it cannot be shipped through modern pipelines like liquid hydrocarbons  mechanics have seen increased cases of damage to small engines in particular the carburetor attributable to the increased water retention by ethanol in fuel  ethanol was commonly used as fuel in early bipropellant rocket liquid propelled vehicles in conjunction with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen the german v2 rocket of world war ii credited with beginning the space age used ethanol mixed with 25 of water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature   the v2s design team helped develop us rockets following world war ii including the ethanolfueled redstone rocket which launched the first us satellite  alcohols fell into general disuse as more efficient rocket fuels were developed  commercial fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas hydrogen or methanol ethanol is an attractive alternative due to its wide availability low cost high purity and low toxicity there are a wide range of fuel cell concepts that have been trialled including directethanol fuel cells autothermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems the majority of work is being conducted at a research level although there are a number of organizations at the beginning of commercialization of ethanol fuel cells  ethanol fuels flueless real flame fireplaces ethanol is kept in a burner containing a wick such as glass wool a safety shield to reduce the chances of accidents and an extinguisher such as a plate or shutter to cut off oxygen it provides almost the same visual benefits of a real flame log or coal fire without the need to vent the fumes via a flue as ethanol produces very little hazardous carbon monoxide and little or no noticeable scent it does emit carbon dioxide and requires oxygen therefore external ventilation of the room containing the fire is needed to ensure safe operation an additional benefit is that unlike a flue based fireplace 100 of the heat energy produced enters the room this serves to offset some of the heat loss from an external air vent as well as offset the relatively high cost of the fuel compared to other forms of heating ethanol is an important industrial ingredient it has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as ethyl halides ethyl esters diethyl ether acetic acid and ethyl amines ethanol is miscible with water and is a good general purpose solvent it is found in paints tinctures markers and personal care products such as mouthwashes perfumes and deodorants however polysaccharides precipitate from aqueous solution in the presence of alcohol and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of dna and rna when alcohol reaches the brain it has the ability to delay signals that are sent between nerve cells that control balance thinking and movement  alcohol stimulates gastric juice production even when food is not present in other words when a person drinks alcohol the alcohol will stimulate stomachs acidic secretions that are intended to digest protein molecules consequently the acidity has potential to harm the inner lining of the stomach normally the stomach lining is protected by a mucus layer that prevents any acids from reaching the stomach cells however in patients who have a peptic ulcer disease pud this mucus layer is broken down pud is commonly associated with a bacteria h pylori h pylori secretes a toxin that weakens the mucosal wall as a result acid and protein enzymes penetrate the weakened barrier because alcohol stimulates a persons stomach to secrete acid a person with pud should avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach drinking alcohol would cause more acid release to damage the weakened stomach wall  complications of this disease could include a burning pain in the abdomen bloating and in severe cases the presence of dark black stools indicate internal bleeding  a person who drinks alcohol regularly is strongly advised to reduce their intake to prevent pud aggravation  ethanolcontaining beverages can cause urticarial skin eruptions systemic dermatitis alcohol flush reactions exacerbations of rhinitis and more seriously and commonly bronchoconstriction in patients with a history of asthma these reactions occur within 160 minutes of ethanol ingestion and are due to 1 genetic abnormalities in the metabolism of ethanol which cause the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde to accumulate in tissues and trigger the release of histamine the evoker of these symptoms 2 true allergy reactions to allergens occurring naturally in or contaminating alcoholic beverages particularly wines and beers and 3 unknown causes  ethanol is classified as a teratogen iarc list ethanol in alcoholic beverages as group 1 carcinogens and arguments there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde the major metabolite of ethanol in experimental animals  frequent drinking of alcoholic beverages has been shown to be a major contributing factor in cases of elevated blood levels of triglycerides  death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol levels reach 04 a blood level of 05 or more is commonly fatal levels of even less than 01 can cause intoxication with unconsciousness often occurring at 0304  prolonged heavy consumption of alcohol can cause significant permanent damage to the brain and other organs the reinforcing effects of alcohol consumption are mediated by acetaldehyde generated by catalase and other oxidizing enzymes such as cytochrome p4502e1 in the brain  although acetaldehyde has been associated with some of the adverse and toxic effects of ethanol it appears to play a central role in the activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system  ethanols rewarding and reinforcing ie addictive properties are mediated through its effects on dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic reward pathway which connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens nacc   one of ethanols primary effects is the allosteric inhibition of nmda receptors and facilitation of gabaa receptors eg enhanced gabaa receptormediated chloride flux through allosteric regulation of the receptor  at high doses ethanol inhibits most ligand gated ion channels and voltage gated ion channels in neurons as well  with acute alcohol consumption dopamine is released in the synapses of the mesolimbic pathway in turn heightening activation of postsynaptic d1 receptors   the activation of these receptors triggers postsynaptic internal signaling events through protein kinase a which ultimately phosphorylate camp response element binding protein creb inducing crebmediated changes in gene expression   with chronic alcohol intake consumption of ethanol similarly induces creb phosphorylation through the d1 receptor pathway but it also alters nmda receptor function through phosphorylation mechanisms   an adaptive downregulation of the d1 receptor pathway and creb function occurs as well   chronic consumption is also associated with an effect on creb phosphorylation and function via postsynaptic nmda receptor signaling cascades through a mapkerk pathway and camkmediated pathway  these modifications to creb function in the mesolimbic pathway induce expression ie increase gene expression of \u03b4fosb in the nacc  where \u03b4fosb is the master control protein that when overexpressed in the nacc is necessary and sufficient for the development and maintenance of an addictive state ie its overexpression in the nucleus accumbens produces and then directly modulates compulsive alcohol consumption     discontinuing consumption of alcohol after several years of heavy drinking can also be fatal alcohol withdrawal can cause anxiety autonomic dysfunction seizures and hallucinations delirium tremens is a condition that requires people with a long history of heavy drinking to undertake an alcohol detoxification regimen ethanol can intensify the sedation caused by other central nervous system depressant drugs such as barbiturates benzodiazepines opioids nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem and zopiclone antipsychotics sedative antihistamines and antidepressants  it interacts with cocaine in vivo to produce cocaethylene another psychoactive substance  ethanol enhances the bioavailability of methylphenidate elevated plasma dmph  in combination with cannabis ethanol increases plasma thc levels which suggests that ethanol may increase the absorption of thc  one of the most important drugfood interactions that should be noted is between alcohol and metronidazole metronidazole is an antibacterial agent that kills bacteria by damaging cellular dna and hence cellular function  metronidazole is usually given to people who have diarrhea caused by clostridium difficile bacteria c difficile is one of the most common microorganisms that cause diarrhea and can lead to complications such as colon inflammation and even more severely death patients who are taking metronidazole are strongly advised to avoid alcohol even after 1hour after the last dose the reason is that alcohol and metronidazole can lead to side effects such as flushing headache nausea vomiting abdominal cramps and sweating    these symptoms are often called the disulfiramlike reaction the proposed mechanism of action for this interaction is that metronidazole can bind to an enzyme that normally metabolizes alcohol binding to this enzyme may impair the livers ability to process alcohol for proper excretion  ethanol acts in the central nervous system primarily by binding to the gabaa receptor increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba ie it is a positive allosteric modulator  ethanol is known to possess the following direct pharmacodynamic actions most important actions are bolded  some of its actions on ligandgated ion channels specifically the nach receptors and the glycine receptor are dosedependent with potentiation or inhibition occurring dependent on ethanol concentration this is because ethanols effects on these channels are a summation of positive and negative allosteric modulatory actions  the removal of ethanol from the human body through oxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver is limited hence the removal of a large concentration of alcohol from blood may follow zeroorder kinetics this means that alcohol leaves the body at a constant rate rather than having an elimination halflife  the ratelimiting steps for one substance may be in common with other substances as a result the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the rate of metabolism of methanol and ethylene glycol methanol itself is not highly toxic but its metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid are therefore to reduce the rate of production and concentration of these harmful metabolites ethanol can be ingested  ethylene glycol poisoning can be treated in the same way pure ethanol will irritate the skin and eyes  nausea vomiting and intoxication are symptoms of ingestion longterm use by ingestion can result in serious liver damage  atmospheric concentrations above one in a thousand are above the european union occupational exposure limits  ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into the acetyl in acetyl coa by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase acetyl coa is the final product of both carbohydrate and fat metabolism where the acetyl can be further used to produce energy or for biosynthesis as such ethanol can be compared to an energybearing macronutrient yielding approximately 7 kcal per gram consumed  however the product of the first step of this breakdown acetaldehyde  is more toxic than ethanol acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol it has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver  and multiple forms of cancer during the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases nad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is converted into reduced nad normally nad is used to metabolise fats in the liver and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of nad prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver leading to the term fatty liver continued consumption such as in alcoholism then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death these cells are then replaced with scar tissue leading to the condition called cirrhosis a part of ethyl alcohol is hydrophobic this hydrophobic or lipophilic end can diffuse across cells that line the stomach wall in fact alcohol is one of the rare substances that can be absorbed in the stomach most food substances are absorbed in the small intestine however even though alcohol can be absorbed in the stomach it is mostly absorbed in the small intestine because the small intestine has a large surface area that promotes absorption once alcohol is absorbed in the small intestine it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into the small intestine thus alcohol can delay the rate of absorption of nutrients  after absorption alcohol reaches the liver where it is metabolized breathalyzersalcohol that is not processed by the liver goes to the heart the liver can process only a certain amount of alcohol per unit time thus when a person drinks too much alcohol more alcohol can reach the heart in the heart alcohol reduces the force of heart contractions consequently the heart will pump less blood lowering overall body blood pressure  also blood that reaches the heart goes to the lungs to replenish bloods oxygen concentration it is at this stage that a person can breathe out traces of alcohol  this is the underlying principle of the alcohol breath testing or breathalyzers to determine if a driver has been drinking and driving  from the lungs blood returns to the heart and will be distributed throughout the body interestingly alcohol increases levels of highdensity lipoproteinshdls which carry cholesterol  alcohol is known to make blood less likely to clot reducing risk of heart attack and stroke this could be the reason that alcohol seems to produce health benefits when consumed in moderate amounts  also alcohol dilates blood vessels consequently a person will feel warmer and hisher skin flush and appear pink  some individuals have less effective forms of one or both of the metabolizing enzymes and can experience more severe symptoms from ethanol consumption than others however those having acquired alcohol tolerance have a greater quantity of these enzymes and metabolize ethanol more rapidly  ethanol is a volatile colorless liquid that has a slight odor it burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light the physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its hydroxyl group and the shortness of its carbon chain ethanols hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight such as propane ethanol is slightly more refractive than water having a refractive index of 136242 at \u03bb5893nm and 1835c or 6503f  the triple point for ethanol is 150 k at a pressure of 43  10  pa  ethanol is a versatile solvent miscible with water and with many organic solvents including acetic acid acetone benzene carbon tetrachloride chloroform diethyl ether ethylene glycol glycerol nitromethane pyridine and toluene   it is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane and hexane and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene  ethanols miscibility with water contrasts with the immiscibility of longerchain alcohols five or more carbon atoms whose water miscibility decreases sharply as the number of carbons increases  the miscibility of ethanol with alkanes is limited to alkanes up to undecane mixtures with dodecane and higher alkanes show a miscibility gap below a certain temperature about 13c for dodecane  the miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete miscibility increases ethanolwater mixtures have less volume than the sum of their individual components at the given fractions mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only 192 volumes of mixture   mixing ethanol and water is exothermic with up to 777jmol  being released at 298k mixtures of ethanol and water form an azeotrope at about 89 mole ethanol and 11 mole water  or a mixture of 956 percent ethanol by mass or about 97 alcohol by volume at normal pressure which boils at 351k 78c this azeotropic composition is strongly temperature and pressuredependent and vanishes at temperatures below 303k  hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be hygroscopic to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air the polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds notably sodium and potassium hydroxides magnesium chloride calcium chloride ammonium chloride ammonium bromide and sodium bromide  sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol  because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end it will also dissolve nonpolar substances including most essential oils  and numerous flavoring coloring and medicinal agents the addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the surface tension of water this property partially explains the tears of wine phenomenon when wine is swirled in a glass ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass as the wines ethanol content decreases its surface tension increases and the thin film beads up and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet an ethanolwater solution that contains 40 abv alcohol by volume will catch fire if heated to about 26c 79f and if an ignition source is applied to it this is called its flash point  the flash point of pure ethanol is 1660c 6188f less than average room temperature alcoholic beverages that have a low concentration of ethanol will burn if sufficiently heated and an ignition source such as an electric spark or a match is applied to them for example the flash point of ordinary wine containing 125 ethanol is about 52c 126f  dishes using burning alcohol for culinary effects are called flambé ethanol is a byproduct of the metabolic process of yeast as such ethanol will be present in any yeast habitat ethanol can commonly be found in overripe fruit  ethanol produced by symbiotic yeast can be found in bertam palm blossoms although some animal species such as the pentailed treeshrew exhibit ethanolseeking behaviors most show no interest or avoidance of food sources containing ethanol  ethanol is also produced during the germination of many plants as a result of natural anerobiosis  ethanol has been detected in outer space forming an icy coating around dust grains in interstellar clouds  minute quantity amounts average 196 ppb of endogenous ethanol and acetaldehyde were found in the exhaled breath of healthy volunteers  autobrewery syndrome also known as gut fermentation syndrome is a rare medical condition in which intoxicating quantities of ethanol are produced through endogenous fermentation within the digestive system   ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical through the hydration of ethylene and via biological processes by fermenting sugars with yeast  which process is more economical depends on prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed stocks ethanol for use as an industrial feedstock or solvent sometimes referred to as synthetic ethanol is made from petrochemical feed stocks primarily by the acidcatalyzed hydration of ethylene the catalyst is most commonly phosphoric acid   adsorbed onto a porous support such as silica gel or diatomaceous earth this catalyst was first used for largescale ethanol production by the shell oil company in 1947  the reaction is carried out in the presence of high pressure steam at 300c 572f where a 1006 ethylene to steam ratio is maintained   in the us this process was used on an industrial scale by union carbide corporation and others but now only lyondellbasell uses it commercially in an older process first practiced on the industrial scale in 1930 by union carbide  but now almost entirely obsolete ethylene was hydrated indirectly by reacting it with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce ethyl sulfate which was hydrolyzed to yield ethanol and regenerate the sulfuric acid  ethanol in alcoholic beverages and fuel is produced by fermentation certain species of yeast eg saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolizes sugar producing ethanol and carbon dioxide the chemical equations below summarize the conversion fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol this process is carried out at around 3540c 95104f toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing higher concentrations therefore are obtained by fortification or distillation the most ethanoltolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately 18 ethanol by volume to produce ethanol from starchy materials such as cereal grains the starch must first be converted into sugars in brewing beer this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate or malt which produces the enzyme amylase when the malted grain is mashed the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars sugars for ethanol fermentation can be obtained from cellulose deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulosecontaining agricultural byproducts such as corncobs straw and sawdust into renewable energy resources other agricultural residues such as sugar cane bagasse and energy crops such as switchgrass may also be a sources of fermentable sugars  breweries and biofuel plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the ch band at 2900cm  this method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the ch band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content the calculation makes use of the beerlambert law alternatively by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product using a hydrometer the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content this inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanolwater mixture for most industrial and fuel uses the ethanol must be purified fractional distillation can concentrate ethanol to 956 by volume 895 mole this mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of 781c 1726f and cannot be further purified by distillation addition of an entraining agent such as benzene cyclohexane or heptane allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol water and the entraining agent to be formed this lowerboiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially leading to waterfree ethanol  at pressures less than atmospheric pressure the composition of the ethanolwater azeotrope shifts to more ethanolrich mixtures and at pressures less than 70torr 9333kpa there is no azeotrope and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanolwater mixture while vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical pressureswing distillation is a topic of current research in this technique a reducedpressure distillation first yields an ethanolwater mixture of more than 956 ethanol then fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 956 azeotrope leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom  apart from distillation ethanol may be dried by addition of a desiccant such as molecular sieves cellulose and cornmeal the desiccants can be dried and reused  molecular sieves can be used to selectively absorb the water from the 956 ethanol solution synthetic zeolite in pellet form can be used as well as a variety of plantderived absorbents including cornmeal straw and sawdust the zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot carbon dioxide cornmeal and other plantderived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated but where ethanol is made from grain they are often available at low cost absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water membranebased separations are not subject to the limitations of the waterethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vaporliquid equilibria membranes are often used in the socalled hybrid membrane distillation process this process uses a preconcentration distillation column as first separating step the further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed a variety of other techniques have been discussed including the following  pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily taxed as psychoactive drugs but ethanol has many uses that do not involve consumption by humans to relieve the tax burden on these uses most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink these include bittering agents such as denatonium benzoate and toxins such as methanol naphtha and pyridine products of this kind are called denatured alcohol   absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content there are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1 to a few parts per million ppm levels if azeotropic distillation is used to remove water it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent eg benzene  absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications where water will react with other chemicals and as fuel alcohol spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light fit for use as a solvent in ultravioletvisible spectroscopy  pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the us equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the uk system  rectified spirit an azeotropic composition of 96 ethanol containing 4 water is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes wine spirits are about 94 ethanol 188 proof the impurities are different from those in 95 190 proof laboratory ethanol  ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol meaning that the carbon its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well many ethanol reactions occur at its hydroxyl group in the presence of acid catalysts ethanol reacts with carboxylic acids to produce ethyl esters and water this reaction which is conducted on large scale industrially requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt this reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids diethyl sulfate and triethyl phosphate are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and phosphorus pentoxide respectively diethyl sulfate is a useful ethylating agent in organic synthesis ethyl nitrite prepared from the reaction of ethanol with sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid was formerly used as a diuretic strong acid desiccants cause the partial dehydration of ethanol to form diethyl ether and other byproducts if the dehydration temperature exceeds around 160c 320f full dehydration will occur and ethylene will be the main product complete combustion of ethanol forms carbon dioxide and water specific heat  244 kjkgk ethanol is a neutral molecule and the ph of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 700 ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its conjugate base the ethoxide ion ch3ch2o  by reaction with an alkali metal such as sodium  or a very strong base such as sodium hydride the acidity of water and ethanol are nearly the same as indicated by their pka of 157 and 16 respectively thus sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides but the reactions are illustrative ethanol reacts with hydrogen halides to produce ethyl halides such as ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide via an sn2 reaction these reactions require a catalyst such as zinc chloride  hbr requires refluxing with a sulfuric acid catalyst  ethyl halides can in principle also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus tribromide   upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base ethanol gives the corresponding haloform chx3 where x  cl br i this conversion is called the haloform reaction   an intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the aldehyde called chloral ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde and further oxidized to acetic acid depending on the reagents and conditions  this oxidation is of no importance industrially but in the human body these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase the oxidation product of ethanol acetic acid is a nutrient for humans being a precursor to acetyl coa where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis the fermentation of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest biotechnologies employed by humans the intoxicating effects of ethanol consumption have been known since ancient times ethanol has been used by humans since prehistory as the intoxicating ingredient of alcoholic beverages dried residue on 9000yearold pottery found in china suggests that neolithic people consumed alcoholic beverages  although distillation was well known by the early greeks and arabs the first recorded production of alcohol from distilled wine was by the school of salerno alchemists in the 12th century  the first to mention absolute alcohol in contrast with alcoholwater mixtures was raymond lull  in 1796 germanrussian chemist johann tobias lowitz obtained pure ethanol by mixing partially purified ethanol the alcoholwater azeotrope with an excess of anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat  french chemist antoine lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of carbon hydrogen and oxygen and in 1807 nicolasthéodore de saussure determined ethanols chemical formula   fifty years later archibald scott couper published the structural formula of ethanol it was one of the first structural formulas determined  ethanol was first prepared synthetically in 1825 by michael faraday he found that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of coal gas  he gave the resulting solution to henry hennell a british chemist who found in 1826 that it contained sulphovinic acid ethyl hydrogen sulfate  in 1828 hennell and the french chemist georgessimon sérullas independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol   thus in 1825 faraday had unwittingly discovered that ethanol could be produced from ethylene a component of coal gas by acidcatalyzed hydration a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis  ethanol was used as lamp fuel in the united states as early as 1840 but a tax levied on industrial alcohol during the civil war made this use uneconomical the tax was repealed in 1906  use as an automotive fuel dates back to 1908 with the ford model t able to run on petrol gasoline or ethanol  it fuels some spirit lamps ethanol intended for industrial use is often produced from ethylene  ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption including scents flavorings colorings and medicines in chemistry it is both a solvent and a feedstock for the synthesis of other products it has a long history as a fuel for heat and light and more recently as a fuel for internal combustion engines a 2002 study found 41 of people fatally injured in traffic accidents were in alcohol related crashes  the risk of a fatal car accident increases exponentially with the level of alcohol in the drivers blood  most drunk driving laws governing the acceptable levels in the blood while driving or operating heavy machinery set typical upper limits of blood alcohol content bac between 002 and 008

V situs ambiguus or situs ambiguous the former spelling is more correct etymologically but the latter spelling is very common also known as heterotaxy or heterotaxia is a rare congenital defect in which the major visceral organs are distributed abnormally within the chest and abdomen heterotaxy in general refers to any defect of leftright laterality and arrangement of the visceral organs this includes the congenital defect situs inversus which results when arrangement of the organs in the abdomen and chest are mirrored so the positions are opposite the normal placement situs inversus is the mirror image of situs solitus which is normal asymmetric distribution of the abdominothoracic visceral organs patients with situs ambiguous are considered isomeric in that they have organs with 2rightsides or 2leftsides most commonly observed in relation to the atria of the heart individuals with situs inversus or situs solitus do not experience fatal dysfunction of their organ systems as general anatomy and morphology of the abdominothoracic organvessel systems are conserved unfortunately due to abnormal arrangement of organs in situs ambiguous orientation across the leftright axis of the body is disrupted early in fetal development resulting in severely flawed cardiac development and function in 5080 of cases they also experience complications with systemic and pulmonary blood vessels significant morbidity and sometimes death  all patients with situs ambiguous lack lateralization and symmetry of organs in the abdominal and thoracic cavities and are clinically considered to have a form of heterotaxy syndrome heterotaxy syndrome with atrial isomerism occurs in 1 out of every 10000 live births and is associated with approximately 3 of congenital heart disease cases  additional estimation of incidence and prevalence of isomerism proves difficult due to failure to diagnose and underestimation of the disease by clinicians furthermore right isomerism is much more easily recognized than left isomerism contributing to the failure to diagnose  situs ambiguous is a growing field of research with findings dating back to 1973    there are a variety of clinical manifestations of situs ambiguous acute symptoms can be due to both cardiac and noncardiac defects cyanosis or blue skin coloration primarily affecting the lips and fingernails can indicate a systemic or circulatory issue poor feeding failure to thrive and rapid shallow breathing may also be observed due to poor circulation upon examination arrhythmia and heart murmur may raise further suspicion of a cardiac abnormality noncardiac symptoms include impairments of the liver and gastrointestinal tract biliary atresia or inflammation and destruction of the bile ducts may lead to jaundice vomiting and swelling of the abdominal region are features that suggest improper positioning of the intestines poor positioning of the intestine also makes it more prone to blockage which can result in numerous chronic health issues  asplenia and polysplenia are also possible features of heterotaxy syndrome  due to abnormal cardiac development patients with situs ambiguous usually develop right atrial isomerism consisting of 2 bilaterally paired right atria or left atrial isomerism consisting of 2 bilaterally paired left atria clinical features and symptoms can vary dependent upon assignment of left versus right atrial isomerism in either instance the apex of the heart will be poorly positioned which should alert a clinician of the likelihood of atrial isomerism it is estimated that 510 of isomeric patients have mesocardia in which the heart is positioned at the center of the thorax 2550 have dextrocardia in which the apex of the heart is pointed toward the right side of the thorax and 50  70 have levocardia in which the apex of the heart is pointed toward the left side of the thorax  right atrial appendage isomerism also called right atrial isomerism is a cardiac development defect in which the heart has bilateral right atria and atrial attachments in the muscle wall as opposed to the normal right atrium and left atrium in right atrial isomerism the pulmonary blood oxygen tract is damaged due to rightleft shunting of blood in addition the atrial septum which distinguishes the 2 atria is absent these impairments in addition to congestion in the pulmonary tract allows deoxygenated blood to mix with oxygenated blood contributing to cyanosis and possible respiratory distress poor systemic circulation also results due to improper positioning of the aorta  left atrial appendage isomerism also called left atrial isomerism is a cardiac development defect in which the heart has 2 bilateral left atria and atrial appendages in the muscle wall left atrial isomerism can have varied clinical manifestations including a later onset of symptoms heart failure is often a concern because the inferior vena cava is disrupted due to the inappropriate morphology of the left ventricle to support the vena cava  abnormal development of the heart results in impaired doubles of conductive nodes as well as faulty electrical fibers throughout the ventricles individuals with right atrial isomerism develop 2 sinoatrial nodes as they have 2 mirrored right atria whereas those with left atrial isomerism fail to develop a sinus node at all thus patients with left atrial isomerism are more likely to experience atrial fibrillation or irregular rapid heart beat and abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial flutter development of the atrioventricular node and bundle of his largely depends on physiological looping of the ventricles abnormal looping of the ventricles contributes to arrhythmia and heart block in fetuses  isomerism of the bronchial tree is not typically damaging and presents no significant clinical complications  pulmonary valve stenosis results in issues of blood flow to the lungs abdominal organs including the liver stomach intestinal tract and spleen may be randomly arranged throughout the leftright axis of the body distribution of these organs largely dictates treatment clinical outcomes and further evaluation the liver is typically symmetrical across the leftright axis in patients with situs ambiguous which is abnormal a majority of left atrial isomeric patients have defects throughout the biliary tree which is responsible for bile production even when the gall bladder is functional and morphologically normal this biliary atresia can lead to acute problems such as nutrient malabsorption pale stools dark urine and abdominal swelling if this condition continues without proper treatment cirrhosis and liver failure become a major concern biliary atresia is not usually observed in patients with right atrial isomerism  random positioning of the stomach is often one of the first signals of situs ambiguous upon examination malrotation of the entire intestinal tract or improper folding and bulging of the stomach and intestines results in bowel obstruction this impairment leads to vomiting abdominal distention mucus and blood in the stool patients may also experience abdominal pain intestinal malrotation is more commonly identified in patients with right atrial isomerism than in those with left atrial isomerism isomeric patients often experience disruptions to splenic development during embryogenesis resulting in an overall lack a spleen asplenia or development of many spleens polysplenia asplenia is most often observed in patients with right atrial isomerism polysplenia results in 90 of patients with left atrial isomerism although they have many spleens each is usually ineffective resulting in functional asplenia rarely left atrial isomeric patients have a single normal functional spleen patients lacking a functional spleen are in danger of sepsis and must be monitored  several genes have been identified in normal development of the rightleft axis  these genes have been extensively researched gene mutations that lead to atrial isomerism is a growing area of research mutations in genes that encode proteins in the tgfbeta pathway including nodal nkx25 and zic3 have been linked to tetralogy of fallot and hypoplastic left heart syndrome   mutations in the zic3 gene which encodes for the first zinc finger transcription factor is linked to a 50 risk of atrial isomerism in families it is also an xlinked disorder so testing for zic3 mutations is highly encouraged in male births  the most prevalent and best characterized genetic associations of heterotaxy include  pathophysiology in the bronchial tree can be observed by radiography under normal development the bronchial tree consists of two main bronchi that are anatomically different in situs ambiguus there is a duplication of either the hyparterial or eparterial bronchus these features are not associated with any significant clinical complications  mechanisms leading to bronchial duplication are not thoroughly understood in pulmonary valve stenosis there is a reduction in blood flow to the lungs due to an obstruction of the heart at the pulmonic valve this contributes to cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension  for proper diagnosis of situs ambiguous cardiac and noncardiac features must be evaluated diagnostic criteria for atrial isomerism includes observation of symmetry of thoracic visceral organs upon echocardiogram arrhythmia upon electrocardiogram and chest xray for confirmation of the hearts location across the leftright axis in addition a series of gastrointestinal tests can be conducted for observation of intestinal malrotation as well as a scan of the liver and spleen for biliary function  although its etiology is poorly understood situs ambiguous has been linked to family history of malformations    and maternal cocaine use  suggesting both genetic and environmental factors play a role  several genes in the tgfbeta pathway which controls leftright patterning of viseral organs across the body axis have been indicated in sporadic and familial cases of atrial isomerism there does not appear to be a screening method for prevention of heterotaxy syndrome however genetic testing in family members that display atrial isomerism or other cardiac malformations may help to discern risk for additional family members especially in xlinked causes of heterotaxy syndrome  each of the symptoms of situs ambiguous must be managed with appropriate treatment dependent upon the organ system involved intestinal malrotation is treated surgically using the ladd procedure this procedure widens a fold in the peritoneum so that the intestines can be placed in nonrotated formation unfortunately it is not possible to return the bowel to a normal morphology  however 89 of patients that undergo the ladd surgery experience a complete resolution of symptoms following cholangiogram a kasia procedure is usually performed in cases of biliary atresia in this surgery a yshaped shunt is used to passage bile from the liver directly to the intestine if this is unsuccessful liver transplantation can be considered based on the overall health of the patient fortunately the kasia procedure is successful in approximately 80 of patients  following the operation patients are advised to take fatsoluble vitamins choleretics and antiinflammatory medications functionally asplenic patients have an elevated lifetime risk of septicemia as they have no functional spleen for fighting infection for this reason asplenic patients are under constant observation for any signs of fever or infection in the case of infection patients are placed on controlled empiric antibiotic therapy to avoid development of antibiotic resistance  this therapy battles infection by both grampositive and gramnegative bacteria rightatrial and leftatrial isomerism and associated pulmonary issues are treated in a series of steps based on the severity of symptoms isomeric patients are first treated by inserting a shunt that will move incoming blood through the pulmonary circuit the fontan procedure routes blood through the patients single ventricle to the lungs and into systemic circulation this process is favorable in patients aged 2  5 years old unfortunately 2030 of patients will require a heart transplant  leftatrial isomeric patients have less severe complications as they typically have 2 functional ventricles in this case the can undergo biventricular repair to form 2 separate ventricles and functional associated valves prognosis for patients with situs ambiguous is quite varied considering the spectrum of clinical complications infants who experience severe cyanosis at birth die within hours of delivery if medical intervention in not immediate alternatively longevity of neonates with mild cardiac lesions is unaffected  ten percent of patients born with right atrial isomerism die by the age of 5 without intervention fortunately improvements in therapies has increased the 5year survival to 3074 for right atrial isomeric patients and 6584 for left atrial isomeric patients based on the etiology of their disease there have been vast amounts of research on the clinical features racial disparities and physiological mechanisms of heterotaxy syndrome dating back to 1973 mishra et al published a review in november 2015 describing current knowledge of cardiac and noncardiac abnormalities associated with situs ambiguous the author stresses the importance of genetic testing prior to deciding a prognosis for affected patients  she also proposes prenatal screening and evaluation in cases at risk for development of situs ambiguous recent studies have shown higher rates of heterotaxy syndrome among hispanic infants of mexican descent as well as female infants of nonhispanic black and white mothers additional studies must be done to clarify the mechanisms behind racial disparities in heterotaxy syndrome  individuals of asian descent show a higher prevalence of heterotaxy syndrome in general than members of the western world  the national birth defects prevention study october 2014 attempted to link clinical presentations of situs ambiguous to demographics in an epidemiological study  this proved a difficult task due to the vast differences in presentation of this disorder however the authors are hopeful that finding a link can help inform clinical decisionmaking predictive analyses and future outcomes

V phocomelia from gr \u03c6\u03ce\u03ba\u03b7 p\u02b0\u1e53k\u0113 seal animal  o interfix  \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 mélos limb  eng suff ia is an extremely rare congenital disorder involving malformation of the limbs dysmelia étienne geoffroy sainthilaire coined the term in 1836  although many factors can cause phocomelia the prominent roots come from the use of the drug thalidomide and from genetic inheritance the occurrence of this malformation in an individual results in various abnormalities to the face limbs ears nose vessels and many other underdevelopments although operations can be done to fix the abnormality it is difficult due to the lack of nerves bones and other related structures   thalidomide was released onto the market in 1958 in west germany under the label of contergan primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic thalidomide also claimed to cure anxiety insomnia gastritis and tension  afterwards it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women thalidomide became an overthecounter drug in germany around 1960 and could be bought without a prescription shortly after the drug was sold in germany between 5000 and 7000 infants were born with phocomelia merely 40 of these children survived research also proves that although phocomelia did exist through the 1940s and 1950s cases of severe phocomelia multiplied in the 1960s when thalidomide was released in germany the direct cause was traced to thalidomide  the statistic was given that 50 percent of the mothers with deformed children had taken thalidomide during the first trimester of pregnancy throughout europe australia and the united states 10000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia only 50 of the 10000 survived thalidomide became effectively linked to death or severe disabilities among babies those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps other effects included deformed eyes hearts alimentary and urinary tracts and blindness and deafness  a genetic disease is inherited by an individual from the genes provided by their mother and father depending upon the grouping of these genes for a particular trait determines whether or not an individual will inherit a certain disease according to national organization for rare disorders nord when phocomelia is transmitted in its familial genetic form it is seen as an autosomal recessive trait and the mutation is linked to chromosome 8  recessive genetic disorders occur when a person receives identical abnormal genes from both the father and mother if a person inherits one normal gene and one gene for the disease the individual will become a carrier for the disease however they normally do not show symptoms the chance for two carrier parents to both supply the defective gene and produce a child with symptoms is 25 percent with each pregnancy  a study of roberts syndrome a genetic disorder showing similar symptoms to phocomelia has shed light on the possible causes  during normal cell division each chromosome is replicated and the original chromosome is attached to the new copy although there are several attachment points in a chromosome pair the centromere is the major connection point and is primarily responsible for anchoring the chromosome pair together the chromosomes connection makes sure that the two copies are lined up together at the center of the dividing cell once the chromosomes are aligned tiny molecular spindles attach to each centromere and then pull away the original and new chromosome as cell division continues in this way each daughter cell inherits one of each pair of replicated chromosomes an individual afflicted with roberts syndrome will have chromosome copies that do not connect at the centromeres making them unable to line up accordingly as a result the newly made cells contain an excess or reduced number of chromosomes in both roberts syndrome and phocomelia the cells cease to develop or die preventing proper development of the limbs eyes brain palate or other structures the symptoms of phocomelia syndrome are undeveloped limbs and absent pelvic bones however various abnormalities can occur to the limbs and bones  usually the upper limbs are not fully formed and sections of the hands and arms may be missing short arm bones fused fingers and missing thumbs will often occur legs and feet are also affected similarly to the arms and hands individuals with phocomelia will often lack thigh bones and the hands or feet may be abnormally small or appear as stumps due to their close attachment to the body  according to nord individuals carrying phocomelia syndrome will generally show symptoms of growth retardation previous to and after birth the syndrome can also cause severe mental deficiencies in infants infants born with phocomelia will normally have a petite head with sparse hair that may appear silveryblonde hemangioma the abnormal buildup of blood vessels will possibly develop around the facial area at birth and the eyes may be set widely apart a condition known as orbital hypertelorism the pigment of the eyes will be a bluish white  phocomelia can also cause an undeveloped nose with slender nostrils disfigured ears irregularly petite jaws also known as micrognathia and a cleft lip with cleft palate  according to nord severe symptoms of phocomelia include when an individual is born with phocomelia due to drugs or pharmaceuticals it is known as thalidomide syndrome the symptoms of thalidomide syndrome are defined by absent or shortened limbs causing flipper hands and feet according to anthony j perri iii and sylvia hsu they can additionally receive the infants that were exposed to thalidomide during development phases had a 40 chance of survival  the mcmrediemcbride hypothesis explains that the limbs of the infants become malformed as a result of the thalidomide harming the neural tissuesimply because the neural tissue has such a large impact on formation and development of the limbs  prosthesis is a synthetic alternative for missing limbs teeth and various other body parts advances in prosthetic limbs have increased greatly during the twentieth century the use of new materials such as modern plastics complex procedures and better pigments have created lighter in weight and more realistic looking artificial limbs with the advancement of myoelectric prosthetic limbs patients are able to move their limbs without the use of cords or other devices the myoelectric limbs can detect electric signals from the nervous system and muscles they were first used on adults but now they are being fitted to children  patients that receive a loss of limbs due to phocomelia are typically treated with prosthetics infants at the age of 6 months are recommended to have a prosthetic mitten fitted enabling them to get used to the prosthesis a hook will be added when the child reaches the age of 2 years eventually the patient may receive a myoelectric prosthetic limb patients are treated in this way due to the lack of understanding at a young age and the absence of necessary tissues and bones to hold the prosthetic limb thomas quasthoff an opera singer eli bowen who made his living performing in sideshows  and hee ah lee a pianist who has two

V gastroschisis represents a congenital defect characterised by a defect in the anterior abdominal wall through which the abdominal contents freely protrude there is no overlying sac  or peritoneum and the size of the defect is usually less than 4 centimetres 16in the abdominal wall defect is located at the junction of the umbilicus and normal skin and is almost always to the right of the umbilicus  the defect occurs 58 weeks after conception most likely due to a disruption of the blood supply to the developing abdominal wall  widespread use of antenatal ultrasound examination and maternal serum alphafetoprotein msafp screening has made the detection of gastroschisis possible in the second trimester of pregnancy  omphalocele is another congenital birth defect but it involves the umbilical cord itself and the organs remain enclosed in visceral peritoneum with omphalocele the defect is usually much larger than in gastroschisis   gastroschisis is believed to be caused by a disruption of the blood supply to the developing abdominal wall from the omphalomesenteric duct artery by the eighth week of gestation  it is not exactly known what causes this blood supply disruption but various factors have been shown to increase this risk numerous clinical studies have linked aspirin a us food and drug administration fda pregnancy category d drug as an increased risk factor    and according to large scale study by the california department of public health aspirin quadruples the risk of gastroschisis  a change in paternity childbearing with different fathers has been implicated as a risk factor in a recent study suggesting that the immune system of the mother may play a role in the development of gastroschisis  it is most commonly seen in young mothers newborns are often smaller for gestational age due to their abdomen not expanding because the bowels and sometimes other organs are outside of the body whether the intrauterine growth retardation can facilitate the apparition of gastroschisis or the abdominal wall defect impairs fetal growth is not clear yet gastroschisis as a standalone congenital defect like many birth defects when isolated exhibits multifactorial determination with a 23 recurrence risk for subsequent pregnancies rarely gastroschisis has clustered in families and exhibits autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance  genetic counseling and further genetic testing such as amniocentesis may be offered during the pregnancy as this and other abdominal wall defects are associated with genetic disorders if there are no additional genetic problems or birth defects surgery soon after birth can often repair the opening at least six hypotheses have been proposed the first hypothesis does not explain why the mesoderm defect would occur in such a specific small area the second hypothesis does not explain the low percentage of associated abnormality compared with omphalocele the third hypothesis was criticized due to no vascular supplement of anterior abdominal wall by umbilical vein the fourth hypothesis was commonly accepted but it was later shown that the right vitelline artery right omphalomesenteric artery did not supply the anterior abdominal wall in this area  more evidence is needed to support the fifth hypothesis  during the fourth week of development the lateral body folds move ventrally and fuse in the midline to form the anterior body wall incomplete fusion results in a defect that allows abdominal viscera to protrude through the abdominal wall the bowel typically herniates through the rectus muscle lying to the right of the umbilicus gastroschisis is a surgical emergency  patients frequently require more than one surgery only about 10 percent of cases can be closed in a single surgery  the general procedure for gastroschisis is to simply tuck the protruding organs back into the opening and apply a belly band pressure until the wound heals itself new advances have been pioneered in repairing the protruding bowel by placing a protective silo around the intestine outside the abdomen then slowly pressuring the herniated intestine into the abdominal cavity this new procedure allows for the bowel to return to its intended shape and location without further traumatizing the infants viscera with undue internal pressure the main cause for lengthy recovery periods in patients is the time taken for the infants bowel function to return to normal current advances in surgical techniques and intensive care management for neonates have increased the survival rate to 90   in adequate settings the possibility of prenatal diagnosis either through echosonogram or any other method available allows the mother to be referred to an adequate center where a caesarean section or induced natural birth can be performed before term as natural birth is recommended and just as safe as with a normal baby preferably within 2 weeks of term and allow the immediate surgery to be performed on the newborn the morbidity is closely related to the presence of other malformations and complications of the wound or the intestine the malformation is slightly more frequent in males than females the frequency of gastroschisis is associated with young maternal age low number of gestations alcohol tobacco and nsaid use and infections this abnormality was historically reported as having a ratio of 110000 and is usually detected before birth it has been reported that the incidence of gastroschisis has increased in recent years  the cdc currently estimates that about 1871 babies are born each year in the united states with gastroschisis  there is an increased incidence when the mother has a history of cigarette smoking use of recreational drugs alcohol consumption low body mass index or increased frequency of genitourinary infection

V a dermoid cyst is a teratoma of a cystic nature that contains an array of developmentally mature solid tissues it frequently consists of skin hair follicles and sweat glands while other commonly found components include clumps of long hair pockets of sebum blood fat bone nails teeth eyes cartilage and thyroid tissue as dermoid cysts grow slowly and contain mature tissue this type of cystic teratoma is nearly always benign in those rare cases wherein the dermoid cyst is malignant a squamous cell carcinoma usually develops in adults while infants and children usually present with an endodermal sinus tumor     due to its classification a dermoid cyst can occur wherever a teratoma can occur ovaries normally grow cystlike structures called follicles each month once an egg is released from its follicle during ovulation follicles typically deflate sometimes fluid accumulates inside the follicle forming a simple containing only fluid cyst  the majority of these functional cysts resolve spontaneously while all ovarian cysts can range in size from very small to quite large dermoid cysts are not classified as functional cysts dermoid cysts originate from totipotential germ cells which are present at birth that differentiate abnormally developing characteristics of mature dermal cells complications exist such as torsion twisting rupture and infection although their incidence is rare dermoid ovarian cysts which are larger or present complications might require removal by either laparoscopy or laparotomy traditional surgery   dermoid cysts can appear in young children often near the lateral aspect of the eyebrow right part of the right eyebrow or left part of the left eyebrow depending on the perceived amount of risk these are sometimes excised or simply kept under observation an inflammatory reaction can occur if a dermoid cyst is disrupted and the cyst can recur if it is not completely excised sometimes complete excision is not practical if the cyst is in a dumbbell configuration whereby it extends through a suture line in the skull if dermoid cysts appear on the medial aspect the possibility of an encephalocele becomes greater and should be considered among the differential diagnoses dermoid cysts develop during pregnancy they occur when skin cells and things like hair sweat glands oil glands or fatty tissue get trapped in the skin as a baby grows in the wombdermoid cysts are present at birth congenital and are common it can be months or years before a dermoid cyst is noticed on a child because the cysts grow slowly dermoid cyst symptoms are minor and the cysts are usually painless they are not harmful to a childs health if they become infected the infection must be treated and the cyst should be removed it is easier to remove cysts and prevent scars if the cyst is removed before it gets infected spinal dermoid cysts are benign ectopic growths thought to be a consequence of embryology errors during neural tube closure their reported incidence is extremely rare accounting for less than 1 of intramedullary spinal cord tumours it has been proposed that a possible 180 cases of spinal dermoid tumours have been identified over the past century in the literature   dermoid cysts more often involve the lumbosacral region than the thoracic vertebrae and are extramedullary presenting in the first decade of life various hypotheses have been advanced to explain the pathogenesis of spinal dermoids the origin of which may be acquired or congenital spinal abnormalities eg intramedullary dermoid cysts may arise more frequently in the lumbosacral region quite often at the level of the conus medullaris and may be seen with other congenital anomalies of the spine including posterior spina bifida occulta as identified by the neuroradiological analysis   a small dermoid cyst on the coccyx can be difficult to distinguish from a pilonidal cyst this is partly because both can be full of hair a pilonidal cyst is a pilonidal sinus that is obstructed any teratoma near the body surface may develop a sinus or a fistula or even a cluster of these such is the case of canadian football league linebacker tyrone jones whose teratoma was discovered when he blew a tooth out of his nose  treatment for dermoid cyst is complete surgical removal preferably in one piece and without any spillage of cyst contents marsupialization a surgical technique often used to treat pilonidal cyst is inappropriate for dermoid cyst due to the risk of malignancy the association of dermoid cysts with pregnancy has been increasingly reported they usually present the dilemma of weighing the risks of surgery and anesthesia versus the risks of untreated adnexal mass most references state that it is more feasible to treat bilateral dermoid cysts of the ovaries discovered during pregnancy if they grow beyond 6cm in diameter this is usually performed through laparotomy or very carefully through laparoscopy and should preferably be done in the second trimester

V klippelfeil syndrome is a rare disease initially reported in 1912 by maurice klippel and andré feil from france  characterized by the congenital fusion of any two of the seven cervical vertebrae   the syndrome occurs in a heterogeneous group of patients unified only by the presence of a congenital defect in the formation or segmentation of the cervical spine klippelfeil results in limited movement of the neck klippelfeil syndrome is sometimes identified by shortness of the neck but not all people with this disorder have a visibly shortened neck some people with the syndrome have a very low hairline  in 1919 andré feil in his phd thesis  suggested another classification of the syndrome encompassing not only deformation of the cervical spine but also deformation of the lumbar and thoracic spine   numerous associated abnormalities of other organ systems may be present this heterogeneity requires comprehensive evaluation of all patients and treatment regimes that can vary from modification of activities to extensive spinal surgeries furthermore it is unclear whether klippelfeil syndrome is a unique disease or if it is one part of a spectrum of congenital spinal deformities klippelfeil syndrome is usually diagnosed after birth the most common sign of the disorder is restricted mobility of the neck and upper spine a short neck and low hairline at the back of the head may occur in some patients associated abnormalities may include  the disorder also may be associated with abnormalities of the head and face skeleton sex organs muscles brain and spinal cord arms legs fingers and heart defects these heart defects often lead to a shortened life expectancy the average being 3545 years of age among males and 4050 among females this condition is similar to the heart failure seen in gigantism  in 2011 a study identifying the occurrence of symptoms of 100 patients was published  the actual prevalence of klippelfeil syndrome is unknown due to the fact that there was no study done to determine the true prevalence  although the actual occurrence for the kfs syndrome is unknown it is estimated to occur 1 in 40000 to 42000 newborns worldwide in addition females seem to be affected slightly more often than males  in 1912 maurice klippel and andre feil independently provided the first descriptions of klippelfeil syndrome they described patients who had a short webbed neck decreased range of motion rom in the cervical spine and a low hairline feil subsequently classified the syndrome into 3 categories a classification scheme for klippelfeil syndrome was proposed in 1919 by andre feil which accounted for cervical thoracic and lumbar spine malformations  however recently dino samartzis and colleagues in 2006 proposed 3 classificationtypes that specifically addressed the cervical spine anomalies and their associated cervical spinerelated symptoms with additional elaboration on various timedependent factors regarding this syndrome  treatment for klippelfeil syndrome is symptomatic and may include surgery to relieve cervical or craniocervical instability and constriction of the spinal cord and to correct scoliosis  failing nonsurgical therapies spinal surgery may provide relief adjacent segment disease and scoliosis are two examples of common symptoms associated with klippelfeil syndrome and they may be treated surgically the three categories treated for types of spinal cord deficiencies are massive fusion of the cervical spine type i the fusion of 1 or 2 vertebrae type ii and the presence of thoracic and lumbar spine anomalies in association with type i or type ii klippelfeil syndrome type iii adjacent segment disease can be addressed by performing cervical disc arthroplasty using a device such as the bryan cervical disc prosthesis  the option of the surgery is to maintain range of motion and attenuate the rate of adjacent segment disease advancement without fusion  another type of arthroplasty that is becoming an alternate choice to spinal fusion is total disc replacement total disc replacement objective is to reduce pain or eradicate it  spinal fusion is commonly used to correct spinal deformities such as scoliosis arthrodesis is the last resort in pain relieving procedures usually when arthroplasties fail the heterogeneity of the klippelfeil syndrome has made it difficult to outline the diagnosis as well as the prognosis classes for this disease because of this it has complicated the exact explanation of the genetic etiology of the syndrome the prognosis for most individuals with kfs is good if the disorder is treated early on and appropriately activities that can injure the neck should be avoided as it may contribute to further damage other diseases associated with the syndrome can be fatal if not treated or if found too late to be treatable  genetic genealogy has identified a specific location of a gene on a chromosome for klippelfeil syndrome mutations in the gdf6 and gdf3 genes have also been identified to cause the disease although some people with klippelfeil syndrome do not have identified mutations in the gdf6 or gdf3 genes in this case the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown gdf6 and gdf3 genes provide the body with instructions for making proteins involved in regulating the growth and maturation of bone and cartilage these proteins actively regulate cell growth in embryonic and adult tissue gdf6 specifically is involved in the formation of vertebral bones among others and establishing boundaries between bones in skeletal development while gdf3 is involved with bone and cartilage growth mutations cause reductions in these functional proteins but it is unclear exactly how a shortage in these proteins leads to incomplete separation of the vertebrae in people with klippelfeil syndrome  however when the gdf6 gene was knocked out in mice the result was the fusion of bones  only by identifying the link between the genetic etiology and the phenotypic pathoanatomy of klippelfeil syndrome will we be able to rationalize the heterogeneity of the syndrome these mutations can be inherited in two ways a case of a child in switzerland was discovered in a necropolis dated between 4500 and 4000 bc  in 2009 archaeologists excavating at a neolithic site of the \u0111a bút culture of northern vietnam discovered the remains of a young man around age 25 burial 9 living between 2000 bc and 1500 bc with klippelfeil syndrome who had apparently been supported by his subsistencelevel community for at least a decade before his death    the 18th dynasty egyptian pharaoh tutankhamun is believed by some to have suffered from klippelfeil syndrome  though others dispute this claim  a more recent case is the english cricketer gladstone

V the kvikk case is about a variety of birth defects in the children of the men who served on hnoms kvikk an investigation found that the ships electronic systems were not to blame no other cause has been established suspicion arose when two former officers accidentally met in the orthopedic department at haukeland university hospital in bergen and it was later revealed that in all eleven children already had been born with birth defects from 1987 to 1994  in the end the case counted 17 injured children and it was also discovered that the phenomenon of birth defects already had started in 1983 among the claimed birth defects are clubfoot thumb hypoplasia hip dysplasia congenital heart defects  structural brain damage cataracts and other defects  some of the children have also had developmental delays and behavioral problems  kvikk was the only vessel in the norwegian navy that was used as an electronic warfare ew vessel and one widely discussed theory was that the powerful electromagnetic radiation from the boats radio communication masts and radar led to several of those who served aboard the ship having children with clubfoot and in some cases stillborn children  the idea was that the powerful radiation possibly damaged genetic material in the sperm of the men who worked aboard  a total of 17 out of 85 children of officers who served at kvikk have been born with birth defects  of the other theories about the cause of the deformities is one that kvikk was the only vessel that was used to experiment with different types of camouflage paint   in 1987 kvikk was equipped for electronic warfare partly by getting an extra radar sender stern rated to 750 watts  which then was used very actively to create radar jamming during exercises and tests kvikk went out of service as an ewvessel in december 1994 the norwegian armed forces knew before the case came up that very powerful radiation had been measured on kvikk there had also been measured heavy radiation at other defense vessels as well as land installations that all exceeded natos limits for radiation hazard   such as the hnoms narvik and hnoms tjeld kvikk however is a much smaller vessel than those and the radiation distance to the crew was thus smaller it was also not uncommon for the crew on kvikk to reside around the mast during noise transmissions and they were thus directly exposed to strong electromagnetic radiation from the mast that it has been speculated in whether may have affected their genetic material as an additional risk factor the radar on kvikk had a stabilizer that were made to ensure that the radar beam was kept level with the horizon so that it also would work in choppy seas but this mechanism had a weakness that made the radar tip over many times and thus sending radiation directly down on the deck therefore the crew in many cases have been directly exposed to radiation at a very close hold when they were on the deck  in addition four fathers who worked as electronic service technicians at the workshop of haakonsvern got children with chromosome abnormalities they worked among other things to correct errors and deficiencies in telecommunications equipment on kvikk and other marine vessels and were therefore under testing exposed to high levels of electromagnetic radiation mostly from radars  and communications equipment it is shown in research from the 60s and 70s that nonionizing radiation in the microwave range can provide genotoxic mechanisms in germ cells in animals which are then relayed to the offspring as well as practical examples have shown that radiation have led to infertility in humans  but little recent research supports this  the norwegian navy the norwegian radiation protection authority nrpa and a research group at norwegian university of science and technology have concluded that there is no demonstrable link between the nonionizing radiation on board and that the children were born with birth defects  the parents in the case have stated that they dont trust the research  the case became known as the haakonsvern navy base in 1996 issued a press release stating that an unusually high number of children of the employees at the naval base were damaged at birth verdens gang vg was the first newspaper that took hold of the case and the newspaper also found the relationship between the children who were born with birth defects and that their fathers had worked at kvikk vg immediately published a headline that read crown prince haakon magnus of norway is one of the many who is currently aboard the mtb vessels and may be exposed to radiation the navy quickly made a decision to investigate whether there was a correlation between the electromagnetic radiation aboard kvikk and the genes of those who had served there but then kvikk was already broken up  only nine days after the original press release from haakonsvern  after three officers in february 1996 had notified the navy inspectorate that they had got children with birth defects after serving on kvikk the navy the same year gave an internal message that they did not want to hear anymore about such abnormalities from the naval staff  the navy began to investigate whether the damages in this and similar cases could be due to radar and radio radiation in 1998 they concluded that this was not the case and that there was no relationship between serving on the ship and having children with birth defects  so that there was no basis for liability in the report the navy went far in rejecting any possible link whatsoever between birth defects to their children and that the fathers had served on kvikk and suggested statistical clustering as an explanation

V radial dysplasia also known as radial club hand or radial longitudinal deficiency is a congenital difference occurring in a longitudinal direction resulting in radial deviation of the wrist and shortening of the forearm it can occur in different ways from a minor anomaly to complete absence of the radius radial side of the carpal bones and thumb  hypoplasia of the distal humerus may be present as well and can lead to stiffnes of the elbow  radial deviation of the wrist is caused by lack of support to the carpus radial deviation may be reinforced if forearm muscles are functioning poorly or have abnormal insertions  although radial longitudinal deficiency is often bilateral the extent of involvement is most often asymmetric  the incidence is between 130000 and 1100000 and it is more often a sporadic mutation rather than an inherited condition   in case of an inherited condition several syndromes are known for an association with radial dysplasia such as the cardiovascular holtoram syndrome the gastrointestinal vater syndrome and the hematologic fanconi anemia and tar syndrome  other possible causes are an injury to the apical ectodermal ridge during upper limb development  intrauterine compression or maternal drug use thalidomide    classification of radial dysplasia is practised through different models some only include the different deformities or absences of the radius where others also include anomalies of the thumb and carpal bones the bayne and klug classification discriminates four different types of radial dysplasia  a fifth type was added by goldfarb et al describing a radial dysplasia with participation of the humerus  in this classification only anomalies of the radius and the humerus are taken in consideration james and colleagues expanded this classification by including deficiencies of the carpal bones with a normal distal radius length as type 0 and isolated thumb anomalies as type n  type n isolated thumb anomalytype 0 deficiency of the carpal bonestype i short distal radiustype ii hypoplastic radius in miniaturetype iii absent distal radiustype iv complete absent radiustype v complete absent radius and manifestations in the proximal humerus the term absent radius can refer to the last 3 types in cases of a minor deviation of the wrist treatment by splinting and stretching alone may be a sufficient approach in treating the radial deviation in rd besides that the parent can support this treatment by performing passive exercises of the hand this will help to stretch the wrist and also possibly correct any extension contracture of the elbow furthermore splinting is used as a postoperative measure trying to avoid a relapse of the radial deviation  more severe types bayne type iii en iv of radial dysplasia can be treated with surgical intervention the main goal of centralization is to increase hand function by positioning the hand over the distal ulna and stabilizing the wrist in straight position splinting or softtissue distraction may be used preceding the centralization in classic centralization central portions of the carpus are removed to create a notch for placement of the ulna  a different approach is to place the metacarpal of the middle finger in line with the ulna with a fixation pin   if radial tissues are still too short after softtissue stretching soft tissue release and different approaches for manipulation of the forearm bones may be used to enable the placement of the hand onto the ulna possible approaches are shortening of the ulna by resection of a segment or removing carpal bones  if the ulna is significantly bent osteotomy may be needed to straighten the ulna  after placing the wrist in the correct position radial wrist extensors are transferred to the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon to help stabilize the wrist in straight position  if the thumb or its carpometacarpal joint is absent centralization can be followed by pollicization postoperatively a long arm plaster splinter has to be worn for at least 6 to 8 weeks a removable splint is often worn for a long period of time  radial angulation of the hand enables patients with stiff elbows to reach their mouth for feeding therefore treatment is contraindicated in cases of extension contracture of the elbow   a risk of centralization is that the procedure may cause injury to the ulnar physis leading to early epiphyseal arrest of the ulna and thereby resulting in an even shorter forearm   sestero et al reported that ulnar growth after centralization reaches from 48 to 58 of normal ulnar length while ulnar growth in untreated patients reaches 64 of normal ulnar length  several reviews note that centralization can only partially correct radial deviation of the wrist and that studies with longterm followup show relapse of radial deviation   buckgramcko described another operation technique for treatment of radial dysplasia which is called radialization during radialization the metacarpal of the index finger is pinned onto the ulna and radial wrist extensors are attached to the ulnar side of the wrist causing overcorrection or ulnar deviation this overcorrection is believed to make relapse of radial deviation less likely  villki reported a different approach in during this procedure a vascularised mtpjoint of the second toe is transferred to the radial side of ulna creating a platform that provides radial support for the wrist the graft is vascularised and therefore maintains its ability to join the growth of the supporting ulna  prior to the actual transfer of the mtpjoint of the second toe softtissue distraction of the wrist is required to create enough space to place the mtp joint when after several weeks enough space has been created through distraction the actual transfer of the mtp joint can be initiated during this surgical intervention the wrist and the second toe are prepared for transfer at the same time the ipsilateral second toe mtp joint together with its metatarsal arteries its extensor and flexor tendons and its dorsal nerves to the skin is harvested for transfer the distal and middle phalanx of the toe are removed the transferred toe consisting of the metatarsal and proximal phalanx is fixed between the physis of the ulna and the second metacarpal or the scaphoid the tendons of the toe are attached to those of the radial flexor and extensors muscles of the wrist to create more stability to the mtp joint kwires are placed to fixate the bones in the desired position once the bones are secured anastomosis are made between the vessels of the toe and the vessels of the forearm after revascularization of the toe the skin paddle is placed and the skin is closed  vilkki et al have conducted a study on 19 forearms treated with vascularized mtpjoint transfer with a mean followup of 11 years which reports an ulnar length of 67 compared to the contralateral side  de jong et al described in a review that compared to study outcomes on centralization vilkki reported a smaller deviation postoperatively and a lower severity of the relapse

V pseudohermaphroditism or pseudohermaphroditism is the condition in which an organism is born with primary sex characteristics of one sex but develops the secondary sex characteristics   that are different from what would be expected on the basis of the gonadal tissue ovary or testis in some cases the external sex organs look intermediate between a typical clitoris and penis in other cases the external sex organs have an appearance that would be expected to be seen with the opposite gonadal tissue because of this pseudohermaphroditism is sometimes not identified until puberty  it is possible for the condition to be undetected until adulthood  the term male pseudohermaphrodite is used when a testis is present and the term female pseudohermaphrodite is used when an ovary is present  the term true hermaphrodite is reserved for the very rare cases where both ovarian and testicular tissue are present whether or not that term would be appropriate when ovotestes are found or only when distinct ovaries and testes are found is not well defined associated conditions in males include 5\u03b1reductase deficiency  from a deficiency in the male chromosome 46 xy     sex determination and differentiation is generalized with chromosomal sex during fertilization at early stages phenotypic sex does not match chromosomal sexuntil later during intrauterine development sexual maturation is reached during intrauterine development females change to male with the testes moving down from a blind vaginal pouch with a developing scrotum as well as a penis which initially resembled a clitoris what seems like a female phenotype is altered by increased testosterone levels secretion  mutations affecting the androgen receptor ar gene may cause either complete or partial androgen insensitivity syndrome androgen a hormone used to describe a group of sex steroid hormones is responsible for affecting male pseudohermaphroditism the differentiation of the fetus as male takes place during the sixth or seventh week of gestation the development is directed by the testicular determining factor the gene sry sex determining region on y chromosome throughout 9th to 13th week the development of a male genitalia is dependent upon the conversion of testosterone to the more potent androgen by the action of 5\u03b1reductase within the target tissues of the genitalia  a type of internal male pseudohermaphroditism is persistent müllerian duct syndrome which is developed through synthesis of müllerianinhibiting factor defects in such instances duct derivatives are now in 46xy malesthis includes the uterus fallopian tubes and upper vagina these individuals with a hernia sac and bowel loops were found with duct derivatives as well as testes  a study on a male pseudohermaphrodite kitten showed there was a combination of gastrointestinal and urogenital congenital abnormalities it was confirmed to have type ii atresia ani and rectovaginal fistula that is associated with male pseudohermaphroditism  surgery has sometimes been performed to alter the appearance of the genitals   use of the term pseudohermaphroditism can be problematic and is now considered redundant  the term pseudohermaphroditism was created by edwin klebs in 1876   long before the genetic roles of the x chromosome and y chromosome and the social components of gender identity were well characterized which is why the term is usually used to describe the dissonance between gonadal histology and external genital appearance the term intersexuality was introduced by richard goldschmidt in 1923   however the term intersex has also been challenged the lawson wilkins pediatric endocrine society and the european society for pediatric endocrinology have adopted a nomenclature system based on disorders of sex development which covers congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal gonadal or anatomical sex is atypical and thus replaces many disparate terms including but not limited to those based on hermaphrodite   one example of the challenges involved in the use of the term is the case of women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais these women often have primary and secondary sexual characteristics typical of other women however they are karyotypically xy and have internal testes rather than ovaries they have the same likelihood of a karyotypically xx woman of enjoying sexual pleasure but are unable to biologically reproduce their sexuality homosexual heterosexual bisexual etc is unrelated to this syndrome however scientifically precise the description male pseudohermaphrodite may be for such women it is clearly socially inappropriate cais is considered little better by some as the s for syndrome in cais does not accord with the normality many cais women feel about their bodies  in human beings the sex status is defined at four levels chromosomal xy xx internal organs ovaries testicles external organs breasts vulva  vagina penis and psyche sexual identity in a xx human the default development process results in a female in a xy human a set of genes on the y chromosome trigger a cascade of events normally resulting in a male a complete female or male developmental process entails the expression of female and male sex hormones respectively and of their corresponding receptors in the target tissues without these hormones and their receptors the internal and external sex organs and psyche will not develop as expected sex hormones their receptors and downstream signal transduction proteins are coded by genes that may be genetically defective  all these factors mean that genetic mutations can block the sexual development process at three stages a before the development of the internal sex organs b after the development of the internal sex organs but before the development of external sex organs and c after the development of external sex organs but before the maturation of the sexual component of the psyche  while in a the xy human will be indistinguishable anatomically and psychologically from a female in b the individual may either be born with ambiguous external genitals or have genitals apparently in the normal range at birth but at pubertal age not develop secondary sexual characteristics at all or develop secondary sexual characteristics that do not match the external genitals and in c the individual will be transgender formerly referred to as transsexual  in particular where either the individual is a chimera  resulting from a fusion of two distinct embryos one male and one female during fetal development not a genetic mosaic or the individual contains duplicated chromosomes in the genome xxy xxxy in the former case some tissues will be in the xx and others in the xy configuration in the latter all cells contain the y chromosome and may or may not use it this is a gynandromorph which has both female and male characteristics at all four levels and may have either ambiguous sex organs the xyxx configuration may not be evenly distributed throughout the body or unambiguous male and female sex organs hermaphrodite  john money is perhaps the bestknown early researcher in this area his doctoral thesis was titled hermaphroditism an inquiry into the nature of a human paradox and awarded by harvard university in 1952  moneys general views on gender identity as something learned during childhood were later directly contradicted by a biography published in 2001 by one of his former patients david reimer among the repercussions was damage to john moneys reputation not only had his theory of gender plasticity been dealt a severe blow but reimers biography described bizarrely unpleasant childhood therapy sessions and implied that money had ignored or concealed the developing evidence that reimers reassignment to female was not going well moneys defenders have suggested that some of the allegations about the therapy sessions may have been the result of false memory syndrome however reimers brother and mother both agreed that the therapy was not working in the sense that reimer wasnt in any way developing a female selfimage during his treatment with dr money dr money never publicly stated that his conclusions were incorrect  milton diamond has probably become the best known expert public advocate for the intersex community in the early 21st century he is the director of the pacific center for sex and society

V dandywalker syndrome dws is a congenital human brain malformation involving the cerebellum and the fluidfilled spaces around it a key feature of this syndrome is the complete absence of the part of the brain located between the two cerebellar hemispheres cerebellar vermis  the dandywalker complex is a genetically sporadic disorder that occurs one in every 30000 live births  prenatal diagnosis and prognosis of outcomes associated with dandywalker can be difficult  it is named for walter dandy and arthur earl walker     the key features of this syndrome are an enlargement of the fourth ventricle complete absence of the cerebellar vermis the posterior midline area of cerebellar cortex responsible for coordination of the axial musculature and cyst formation near the internal base of the skull an increase in the size of the fluid spaces surrounding the brain as well as an increase in pressure may also be present the syndrome can appear dramatically or develop unnoticed symptoms which often occur in early infancy include slower motor development and progressive enlargement of the skull in older children symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as irritability vomiting and convulsions and signs of cerebellar dysfunction such as unsteadiness and lack of muscle coordination or jerky movements of the eyes may occur other symptoms include increased head circumference bulging at the back of the skull problems with the nerves that control the eyes face and neck and abnormal breathing patterns dandywalker syndrome is frequently associated with disorders of other areas of the central nervous system including absence of the corpus callosum the bundle of axons connecting the two cerebral hemispheres and malformations of the heart face limbs fingers and toes  prenatal diagnosis is possible with ultrasound because the syndrome is associated with an increased risk for fetal karyotype abnormalities amniocentesis can be offered after prenatal diagnosis  there is a relative contraindication of taking warfarin during pregnancy as it is associated with an increased risk of dandywalker syndrome if taken during the first trimester  the term dandywalker represents not a single entity but several abnormalities of brain development which coexist there are at present three identified types of dandywalker complexes these represent closely associated forms of the disorder dws malformation dws mega cisterna magna and dws variant the dws malformation is the most severe presentation of the syndrome the posterior fossa is enlarged and the tentorium is in high position there is complete agenesis of the cerebellar vermis there is also cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle which fills the posterior fossa this often involves hydrocephalus and complications due to associated genetic conditions such as spina bifida the third type is the variant which is less severe than the malformation this form or forms represents the most wideranging set of symptoms and outcomes of dws many patients who do not fit into the two other categories of dws are often labeled as variant the fourth ventricle is only mildly enlarged and there is mild enlargement of the posterior fossa the cerebellar vermis is hypoplastic and has a variably sized cyst space this is caused by open communication of the posteroinferior fourth ventricle and the cisterna magna through the enlarged vallecula patients exhibit hydrocephalus in 25 of cases and supratentorial cns variances are only present in 20 of cases there is no torcularlambdoid inversion as usually seen in patients with the malformation the third and lateral ventricles as well as the brain stem are normal until recently the medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases that are now being found to be related as a result of new genetic research some of these are in fact highly related in their root cause genotype despite the widely varying set of medical characteristics phenotype that are clinically visible in the disorders dandywalker syndrome is one such disease part of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies the underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell organelles which are present in many cellular types throughout the human body the cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multisymptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia bardetbiedl syndrome polycystic kidney and liver disease nephronophthisis alstrom syndrome meckelgruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration  genetic associations of the condition are being investigated  recent research has found that dandywalker syndrome often occurs in patients with phaces syndrome  treatment for individuals with dandywalker syndrome generally consists of treating the associated problems if needed a special tube shunt to reduce intracranial pressure may be placed inside the skull to control swelling  endoscopic third ventriculostomy is also an option treatment may also consist of various therapies such as occupational therapy physiotherapy speech therapy or specialized education services of a vision teacher may be helpful if the eyes are affected this article incorporatespublic domain material from the united states government document dandywalker

V iniencephaly a term derived from the greek word inion for nape of the neck is a rare type of cephalic disorder   that was first described by étienne geoffroy sainthilaire in 1836 those afflicted with the disorder all share 3 common characteristics a defect to the occipital bone spina bifida of the cervical vertebrae and retroflexion backward bending of the head on the cervical spine  stillbirth is the most common outcome with a few rare examples of live birth after which death almost invariably occurs within a short time   there are two types of iniencephaly the more severe group is iniencephaly apertus involving the development of an encephalocele in the other group iniencephaly clausus the encephalocele is absent  the affected infant tends to be short with a disproportionately large head the fetal head of infants born with iniencephaly are hyperextended while the foramen magnum is enlarged and opens through the widened pedicles the defective neural arches directly into the upper cervical reach of the spinal canal causing the formation of a common cavity between most of the spinal cord and the brain the skin of the anterior chest is connected directly to the face bypassing the formation of a neck while the scalp is directly connected to the skin of the back because of this those born with this anomaly either have a highly shortened neck or no neck at all this causes extreme retroflexion or backward bending of the head in a stargazing fashion the spine is severely distorted as well along with significant shortening due to marked lordosis the vertebrae especially cervical are fused together in abnormal shapes and their numbers are reduced the spinal cord is almost always defective while the ventricular system is often dilated and the cortex is thinned sometimes in the case of iniencephaly apertus an encephalocele saclike protrusions of the brain through an opening in the cranium forms    additional symptoms include   though the iniencephaly is not genetic with its cause unknown studies have shown that there are certain factors that can increase the risk of mothers giving birth to children with these anomalies abnormalities in chromosomes such as trisomy 18 trisomy 13 and monosomy x have been shown to be tied to this disorder  mothers with poor socioeconomic conditions poor nutrition low parity and lack of folic acid supplementation andor hyperhomocysteinemia have shown to be at larger risk  animal studies have shown that administration of the drugs vinblastine streptonigrin triparano sulfonamide tetracycline antihistamines and antitumor agents to pregnant mothers have resulted in offspring born with iniencephaly  the drug clomiphene a drug commonly used for ovulation stimulation in fertility treatments has also been seen to be associated with iniencephaly  studies have shown that obesity of the mother increases the risk of neural tube disorders such as iniencephaly by 17 fold while severe obesity increases the risk by over 3 fold  once a mother has given birth to a child with iniencephaly risk of reoccurrence increases to 15  the exact pathogenesis of iniencephaly is still unknown though there are proposed theories most of which view the neural tube malformation from the primary neural anomaly standpoint marinpadilla and marinpadilla have proposed that the cause for the abnormalities has to do with a deficiency in the primary mesoderm p erdinçler et al suggests from their findings that the cause of the anomaly is actually a defect in the occipital bone and rachischisis of the posterior vertebral arches leading to herniation of neural tissue through the opening in the bone during gestation  the most accurate method of diagnosis is prenatal screening through realtime fetal images however since maternal body habitus leads to diagnostic difficulties using this method mri and sonography are the most commonly used technique since there is no exposure to ionizing radiation  at the beginning of the second trimester the central nervous system cns and anatomic structures of the fetus can be clearly visualized and the characteristic malformations of iniencephaly such as a shortened trunk marked lordosis in the cervicothoracic vertebrae absence or partial absence of the occipital squama abnoramal fusion of vertebrae closed vertebral arches formation of an encephalocele for iniencephaly apertus and dorsiflexion of the head in respect to the spine can be precisely diagnosed as well as the severity and location established once established further decisions can be made with regard to terminating the pregnancy or providing a plan of adequate postnatal care  since many of the characteristics of iniencephaly such as congenital retroflexion of the spine and fusion of the cervical vertebrae are shared with other disorders key differences are important to note while anencephaly experiences a partial to total lack of the neurocranium iniencephaly does not in anencephaly the retroflexed head is not covered with skin while in iniencephaly the retroflexed head is covered with skin entirely cervical vertebrae are malformed and reduced in iniencephaly while they are almost normal in anencephaly even though kfs does experience malformed cervical vertebra due to failure of segmentation during early fetal development there is not retroflexion of the head as seen in iniencephaly while iniencephaly clausus is fatal kfs is not and can be surgically corrected therefore it is crucial to correctly diagnose kfs and not mistake it for iniencephaly clausus  pregnant mothers are advised to take folic acid supplements to reduce risk of iniencephaly by up to 70 pregnant mothers are also advised not to take antiepileptic drugs diuretics antihistamines and sulfa drugs all of which have been associated with increased risk for neural tube defects  since newborns with iniencephaly so rarely survive past childbirth a standard treatment does not exist iniencephaly of both types carry a lethal prognosis sometimes even ending in spontaneous abortion or stillborns most infants die within hours of childbirth there are only six reported cases of relatively longterm survival of those born with iniencephaly  iniencephaly is thought to make up around 1 of all fetal abnormalities  with an incidence rate estimated at 01 to 10 in 10000 deliveries for unknown reasons this disease seems to occur most often in newborn females about 90

V 1nbd 1xmi 1xmj 2bbo 2bbs 2bbt 2lob 2pze 2pzf 2pzg 3gd7 3isw cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr is a membrane protein and chloride channel in vertebrates that is encoded by the cftr gene   cftr is an abc transporterclass ion channel that codes for a protein that conducts chloride  and thiocyanate  ions across epithelial cell membranes mutations of the cftr gene affecting chloride ion channel function lead to dysregulation of epithelial fluid transport in the lung pancreas and other organs resulting in cystic fibrosis complications include thickened mucus in the lungs with frequent respiratory infections and pancreatic insufficiency giving rise to malnutrition and diabetes these conditions lead to chronic disability and reduced life expectancy in male patients the progressive obstruction and destruction of the developing vas deferens and epididymis appear to result from abnormal intraluminal secretions  causing congenital absence of the vas deferens and male infertility   the gene that encodes the human cftr protein is found on chromosome 7 on the long arm at position q312  from base pair 116907253 to base pair 117095955 cftr orthologs   occur in the jawed vertebrates  the cftr gene has been used in animals as a nuclear dna phylogenetic marker  large genomic sequences of this gene have been used to explore the phylogeny of the major groups of mammals  and confirmed the grouping of placental orders into four major clades xenarthra afrotheria laurasiatheria and euarchonta plus glires nearly two thousand cystic fibrosiscausing mutations have been described  the most common mutation \u03b4f508 results from a deletion \u03b4 of three nucleotides which results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine f at the 508th position on the protein as a result the protein does not fold normally and is more quickly degraded the vast majority of mutations are infrequent the distribution and frequency of mutations varies among different populations which has implications for genetic screening and counseling mutations consist of replacements duplications deletions or shortenings in the cftr gene this may result in proteins that may not function work less effectively are more quickly degraded or are present in inadequate numbers  it has been hypothesized that mutations in the cftr gene may confer a selective advantage to heterozygous individuals cells expressing a mutant form of the cftr protein are resistant to invasion by the salmonella typhi bacterium the agent of typhoid fever and mice carrying a single copy of mutant cftr are resistant to diarrhea caused by cholera toxin  the most common mutations among caucasians are  the cftr gene is approximately 250 kb in length with 27 exons and 26 introns  cftr is a glycoprotein with 1480 amino acids the protein consists of five domains there are two transmembrane domains each with six spans of alpha helices these are each connected to a nucleotide binding domain nbd in the cytoplasm the first nbd is connected to the second transmembrane domain by a regulatory r domain that is a unique feature of cftr not present in other abc transporters the ion channel only opens when its rdomain has been phosphorylated by pka and atp is bound at the nbds  the carboxyl terminal of the protein is anchored to the cytoskeleton by a pdzinteracting domain  cftr functions as an atpgated anion channel increasing the conductance for certain anions eg cl  to flow down their electrochemical gradient atpdriven conformational changes in cftr open and close a gate to allow transmembrane flow of anions down their electrochemical gradient  this in contrast to other abc proteins in which atpdriven conformational changes fuel uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes essentially cftr is an ion channel that evolved as a broken abc transporter that leaks when in open conformation the cftr is found in the epithelial cells of many organs including the lung liver pancreas digestive tract reproductive tract and skin normally the protein moves chloride and thiocyanate  ions with a negative charge out of an epithelial cell to the covering mucus positively charged sodium ions follow passively increasing the total electrolyte concentration in the mucus resulting in the movement of water out of cell by osmosis in epithelial cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus and the oviduct cftr is located on cell membrane but not on cilia in contrast to cftr enac is located along the entire length of the cilia  these findings contradict a previous hypothesis that cftr normally downregulates enac by direct interaction and that in cf patients cftr cannot downregulate enac causing hyperabsorption in the lungs and recurrent lung infections in sweat glands cftr defects result in reduced transport of sodium chloride and sodium thiocyanate  in the reabsorptive duct and saltier sweat this was the basis of a clinically important sweat test for cystic fibrosis before genetic screening was available  cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator has been shown to interact with it is inhibited by the antidiarrhoea drug crofelemer

V microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder it is an important neurologic sign but no uniformity exists in its definition it is usually defined as a head circumference hc more than two standard deviations below the mean for age and sex   some academics advocate defining it as head circumference more than three standard deviations below the mean for the age and sex  microcephaly may be congenital or it may develop in the first few years of life the disorder may stem from a wide variety of conditions that cause abnormal growth of the brain or from syndromes associated with chromosomal abnormalities a homozygous mutation in one of the microcephalin genes causes primary microcephaly  in general life expectancy for individuals with microcephaly is reduced and the prognosis for normal brain function is poor the prognosis varies depending on the presence of associated abnormalities    affected newborns generally have striking neurological defects and seizures severely impaired intellectual development is common but disturbances in motor functions may not appear until later in life  infants with microcephaly are born with either a normal or reduced head size subsequently the head fails to grow while the face continues to develop at a normal rate producing a child with a small head and a receding forehead and a loose often wrinkled scalp as the child grows older the smallness of the skull becomes more obvious although the entire body also is often underweight and dwarfed development of motor functions and speech may be delayed hyperactivity and intellectual disability are common occurrences although the degree of each varies convulsions may also occur motor ability varies ranging from clumsiness in some to spastic quadriplegia in others  microcephaly is a type of cephalic disorder it has been classified in two types based on the onset  isolated  genetic syndromes acquired a genetic factor may play a role in causing some cases of microcephaly relationships have been found between autism duplications of chromosomes and macrocephaly on one side on the other side a relationship has been found between schizophrenia deletions of chromosomes and microcephaly    moreover an association has been established between common genetic variants within known microcephaly genes mcph1 cdk5rap2 and normal variation in brain structure as measured with mri ie primarily brain cortical surface area and total brain volume  the spread of mosquitoborne zika virus has been implicated in increasing levels of congenital microcephaly by the centers for disease control and prevention   microcephaly means smallheadedness new latin microcephalia from ancient greek \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 small and \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae head  microencephaly means small brain because the size of the brain is mostly determined by the size of the head microencephaly is implied when discussing microcephaly  after the dropping of atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki several women close to ground zero who had been pregnant at the time gave birth to children with microcephaly  microcephaly prevalence was seven of a group of 11 pregnant women at 1117 weeks of gestation who survived the blast at less than 12km 075mi from ground zero due to their proximity to the bomb the pregnant womens in utero children received a biologically significant radiation dose that was relatively high due to the massive neutron output of the lower explosiveyielding little boy  microcephaly is the only proven malformation or congenital abnormality found in the children of hiroshima and nagasaki  generally no specific cure is known for microcephaly treatment is symptomatic and supportive people with microcephaly were sometimes sold to freak shows in north america and europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries where they were known by the name pinheads many of them were presented as different species eg monkey man and described as being the missing link  famous examples are zip the pinhead although he may not have had microcephaly  and schlitzie the pinhead  who also starred in the 1932 movie freaks both these individuals were cited as influences on the development of the longrunning comic strip character zippy the pinhead created by bill griffith

V a monstrous birth variously defined in history is a birth in which a defect of some sort renders the animal or human child monstrous such births were often taken as omens signs of god or moral warnings but besides these supernatural or religious explanations medical explanations were also given in which often the mothers state of mind or her sexual behavior was responsible for the deformed fetus in early and medieval christianity monstrous births posed difficult theological problems about humanity and salvation in the early modern period the interest shifted toward scientific inquiry   an early reference to monstrous birth is found in the apocalyptic biblical text 2 esdras where it is linked to menstruation women in their uncleanness will bear monsters  monstrous births are often placed in a religious context and interpreted as signs and symbols as is evidenced in the 1493 nuremberg chronicle according to david humes the natural history of religion they are among the first signs that arouse the barbarians interest  monstrous human births beg the question of the difference between humans and animals and anthropologists have described different interpretations of and behaviors toward such births among the east african nuer people monstrous births are acted on in a way that restores the division between the categories of human and animal the nuer treat monstrous births as baby hippopotamuses accidentally born to humans and with this labelling the appropriate action is clear they gently lay them in the river where they belong  whether monstrous births were natural unnatural or supernatural remained a topic of discussion saint augustine held that nothing done by the will of god could be contrary to nature whereas thomas aquinas considered some miracles to be against nature  reasons for monstrous births given in early medieval penitentials concerned with sexual sin and thirteenthcentury medical texts concerned with physical purity include pollution through menses and intercourse during menstruation  such explanations are found in many medieval literary texts including jean maillarts fourteenthcentury roman du comte anjou and geoffrey chaucers man of laws tale  sixteenth and seventeenthcentury medical texts which treat pregnancy as a disease  suggest that monstrous births may be the result of the mothers sickness or distress and they continue the myth of bestial intercourse during pregnancy as a cause  the mothers role is of the greatest importance and what was presupposed was the possibility of an emotional transference from mother to fetus referred to as the theory of the maternal imagination according to most of the authors of the sixteenth through early eighteenth centuries an expectant mothers cravings desires and experiencesespecially experiences that aroused strong passions such as fear and lustwere capable of directly inscribing themselves upon the body of the fetus producing deformities and monstrosities that retained the semantic content of the original impression  at the same time an epistemological shift was taking place and monstrous births changed from signs to facts such births were now often publicized in pamphlets and broadsides and became the subject of scientific investigation the early sixteenth century produced an apparent upsurge of interest in monstrous births  monstrous animal births often figure in times of religious upheaval many occurred in the europe of the reformation the advent of luther was supposedly announced by the 1522 birth of a monstrous calf a mooncalf in saxony  and the accession of elizabeth i of england was supposedly indicated by monstrous births as well as a warning to catholics and other sinners  a misshapen calf born in freiberg saxony on 8 december 1522 quickly became important in the german reformation it was born with oddly shaped legs its hind legs straight as a humans and with a fold of skin over its head shaped like a cowlhence its comparison to a monk an illustration made its way to a prague astrologer who discovered that the monster did indeed signify something terrible indeed the most awful thing possiblemartin luther  luther himself responded quickly with a pamphlet containing a mock exegesis of the creature monk calf in which the monk calf stands in all its monstrosity for the catholic church  luthers antipapist pamphlet appeared together with a tract by philipp melanchthon  which discussed a fictional monster the popeass a hybrid between a man and a donkey supposedly found near rome after the 1496 flood  especially monstrous births among humans were from the early middle ages on seen as signifying gods interaction with the world a monstrous birth is the shape of wickedness not only the result of original sin but of more local and immediate forms as well

V neurocutaneous melanosis is a congenital disorder characterized by the presence of congenital melanocytic nevi on the skin and melanocytic tumors in the leptomeninges of the central nervous system  these lesions may occur in the amygdala cerebellum cerebrum pons and spinal cord of patients although typically asymptomatic malignancy occurs in the form of leptomeningeal melanoma in over half of patients  regardless of the presence of malignancy patients with symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis generally have a poor prognosis with few treatment options  the pathogenesis of neurocutaneous melanosis is believed to be related to the abnormal postzygotic development of melanoblasts and mutations of the nras gene    neurocutaneous melanosis was first described in 1861 by rokitansky  it was first named by van bongaert in 1948  premortem detection is difficult without the use of mri this combined with the asymptomatic nature of most cases led to the early belief that all cases were fatal therefore few symptomatic cases around 100 have been reported to date  neurocutaneous melanosis is associated with the presence of either giant congenital melanocytic nevi or nongiant nevi of the skin it is estimated that neurocutaneous melanosis is present in 2 to 45 of patients with giant congenital melanocytic nevi patients with nongiant congenital melanocytic nevi seem to have a much lower but undefined risk of these patients only a small number are symptomatic usually displaying symptoms before the age of 2  these symptoms are the result of melanocytic lesions being present in the leptomeninges of the central nervous system  symptoms can include others symptoms may also exist that are related to an increase in intracranial pressure these symptoms seem to be present regardless of the malignancy of the melanin deposits within the central nervous system  approximately 10 of patient with neurocutaneous melanosis also present the dandywalker syndrome and associated dandywalker malformation this malformation involves an enlargement of the posterior fossae and fourth ventricle along with agenesis of the cerebellar vermis the abnormalities of the leptomeninges during fetal development due to neurocutaneous melanosis may be the cause of this increased incidence of the dandywalker malformation the development of hydrocephalus is the most common symptom associated with a combination of neurocutaneous melanosis and a dandywalker malformation occurring in about 2 out of 3 patients  the exact pathogenesis of neurocutaneous melanosis is not entirely clear although several factors are thought to contribute to its development one factor that may contribute to the development of neurocutaneous melanosis is the abnormal postzygotic development of melanoblasts this mutation would possibly occur within the neural crest of the ectoderm after the mutation occurs these cells would then migrate to the meninges as the precursors to the malignant or benign melanocytes this mutation may be due to abnormal expression of hepatocyte growth factorscatter factor by the mesenchymal cells within the neural crest  another proposed cause of neurocutaneous melanosis is a mutation of the nras gene at codon 61 this mutation has been detected in patients with congenital melanocytic nevi as well as those with melanocytic tumors of the central nervous system the mutation would also likely occur within the neural crest  if a patient displays congenital melanocytic nevi or giant congenital melanocytic nevi the criteria for diagnosis of neurocutaneous melanosis is as follows this criteria is typically validated through biopsy of the cutaneous lesions and imaging of the central nervous system it is important to establish that the cutaneous lesions are benign if not then the melanocytic deposits in the central nervous system may be the result of metastasis of cutaneous melanoma and not neurocutaneous melanosis  imaging has been shown to be the only reliable detection method for the presence of neurocutaneous melanosis that can be performed in living patients currently the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis of neurocutaneous melanosis is magnetic resonance imaging although ultrasound is another viable option  the signal due melanin deposits in the leptomeninges typical of neurocutaneous melanosis can be easily detected in mri scans of patients under 4 months old in patients above this age there is some suggestion that normal brain myelination may partially obscure these signals  as most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis are asymptomatic those who are diagnosed through mr imaging are not guarantied to develop symptoms those diagnosed who did not develop symptoms ranged from 10 to 68 this wide range is most likely due to the large number of asymptomatic undiagnosed patients with neurocutaneous melanosis  once a patient with neurocutaneous melanosis becomes symptomatic little can be done to improve prognosis as there is no effective treatment for the disorder most therapies are designed to treat the symptoms associated with the disorder mainly those related to hydrocephalus a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to relieve intracranial pressure is the preferred method  chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been shown to be ineffective in cases of neurocutaneous melanosis where malignancy is present additionally due to the total infiltration of the central nervous system by these lesions surgical resection is not a viable treatment option  it has been demonstrated that early embryonic postzygotic somatic mutations in the nras gene are implicated in the pathogenesis of ncm recently experimental treatment with mek162 a mek inhibitor has been tried in a patient with ncm and progressive symptomatic leptomeningeal melanocytosis pathological studies with immunohistochemical and western blot analyses using ki67 and perk antibodies showed a potential effect of mek inhibiting therapy further studies are needed to determine whether mek inhibitors can effectively target nrasmutated symptomatic ncm  the majority of patients with neurocutaneous melanosis are asymptomatic and therefore have a good prognosis with few complications although most are not diagnosed so definitive data in not available for symptomatic patients the prognosis is far worse in patients without the presence of melanoma more than 50 die within 3 years of displaying symptoms while those with malignancy have a mortality rate of 77 with most patients displaying symptoms before the age of 2  the presence of a dandywalker malformation along with neurocutaneous melanosis as occurs in 10 of symptomatic patients further deteriorates prognosis the median survival time for these patients is 65 months after becoming symptomatic

V agenesis of the corpus callosum acc is a rare birth defect congenital disorder in which there is a complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum it occurs when the corpus callosum the band of white matter connecting the two hemispheres in the brain fails to develop normally typically during pregnancy the fibers that would otherwise form the corpus callosum become longitudinally oriented within each hemisphere and form structures called probst bundles in addition to agenesis of the corpus callosum other callosal disorders include hypogenesis partial formation dysgenesis malformation of the corpus callosum and hypoplasia underdevelopment of the corpus callosum    callosal disorders can be diagnosed through brain imaging studies or during autopsy  they may be diagnosed through an mri ct scan sonography prenatal ultrasound or prenatal mri  agenesis of the corpus callosum is caused by disruption to development of the fetal brain between the 3rd and 12th weeks of pregnancy  in most cases it is not possible to know what caused an individual to have acc or another callosal disorder however research suggests that some possible causes may include chromosome errors inherited genetic factors prenatal infections or injuries prenatal toxic exposures structural blockage by cysts or other brain abnormalities and metabolic disorders  until recently the medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases that are now being found to be related as a result of new genetic research some of these are in fact highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying symptoms apparent on clinical examination agenesis of the corpus callosum is one such disease part of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies the underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell organelles that are present in many cellular types throughout the human body the cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multisymptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia bardetbiedl syndrome polycystic kidney and liver disease nephronophthisis alstrom syndrome meckelgruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration  signs and symptoms of acc and other callosal disorders vary greatly among individuals however some characteristics common in individuals with callosal disorders include vision impairments low muscle tone hypotonia poor motor coordination delays in motor milestones such as sitting and walking low perception of pain delayed toilet training and chewing and swallowing difficulties laboratory research has demonstrated that individuals with acc have difficulty transferring more complex information from one hemisphere to the other  they also have been shown to have some cognitive disabilities difficulty in complex problem solving and social difficulties missing subtle social cues even when their intelligence quotient is normal  recent research suggests that specific social difficulties may be a result of impaired face processing  the unusual social behavior in childhood is often mistaken for or misdiagnosed as asperger syndrome or other autism spectrum disorders other characteristics sometimes associated with callosal disorders include seizures spasticity early feeding difficulties andor gastric reflux hearing impairments abnormal head and facial features and a mental handicap  some syndromes that frequently include acc are aicardi syndrome andermann syndrome shapiro syndrome acrocallosal syndrome septooptic dysplasia optic

V diethylstilbestrol des inn usan ban also known formerly and inappropriately as stilboestrol ban is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group that was first synthesized in 1938  it is also classified as an endocrine disruptor human exposure to des occurred through diverse sources such as dietary ingestion from supplemented cattle feed and medical treatment for certain conditions including breast and prostate cancers from about 1940 to 1971 des was given to pregnant women in the mistaken belief it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses in 1971 des was shown to cause clear cell carcinoma a rare vaginal tumor in girls and women who had been exposed to this drug in utero the united states food and drug administration subsequently withdrew des from use in pregnant women followup studies have indicated that des also has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse medical complications during the lifetimes of those exposed  the united states national cancer institute recommends  women born to mothers who took des undergo special medical exams on a regular basis to screen for complications as a result of the drug individuals who were exposed to des during their mothers pregnancies are commonly referred to as des daughters and des sons   des was first synthesized in early 1938 by leon golberg then a graduate student of sir robert robinson at the dyson perrins laboratory at the university of oxford golbergs research was based on work by wilfrid lawson at the courtauld institute of biochemistry led by sir edward charles dodds at middlesex hospital medical school now part of university college london a report of its synthesis was published in nature on 5 february 1938    des research was funded by the uk medical research council mrc which had a policy against patenting drugs discovered using public funds because it was not patented des was produced by more than 200 pharmaceutical and chemical companies worldwide des in tablets up to 5 mg was approved by the united states food and drug administration fda on september 19 1941 for four indications gonorrheal vaginitis atrophic vaginitis menopausal symptoms and postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement  the gonorrheal vaginitis indication was dropped when the antibiotic penicillin became available from its very inception the drug was highly controversial   in 1941 charles huggins and clarence hodges at the university of chicago found des to be the first effective drug for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer   orchiectomy or des or both were the standard initial treatment for symptomatic advanced prostate cancer for over 40 years until the gnrh agonist leuprolide was found to have efficacy similar to des without estrogenic effects and was approved in 1985  from the 1940s until the late 1980s des was fdaapproved as estrogenreplacement therapy for estrogen deficiency states such as ovarian dysgenesis premature ovarian failure and after oophorectomy in the 1940s des was used offlabel to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of miscarriage on july 1 1947 the fda approved the use of des for this indication the first such approval was granted to bristolmyers squibb allowing use of 25mg and later 100mg tablets of des during pregnancy approvals were granted to other pharmaceutical companies later in the same year  the recommended regimen started at 5mg per day in the seventh and eighth weeks of pregnancy from first day of last menstrual period increased every other week by 5mg per day through the 14th week and then increased every week by 5mg per day from 25mg per day in the 15th week to 125mg per day in the 35th week of pregnancy  des was originally considered effective and safe for both the pregnant woman and the developing baby it was aggressively marketed and routinely prescribed sales peaked in 1953 in the early 1950s a doubleblind clinical trial at the university of chicago assessed pregnancy outcomes in women who were assigned to either receive or not receive des  the study showed no benefit of taking des during pregnancy adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reduced in the women who were given des by the late 1960s six of seven leading textbooks of obstetrics said des was ineffective at preventing miscarriage   despite an absence of evidence supporting the use of des to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes des continued to be given to pregnant women through the 1960s in 1971 a report published in the new england journal of medicine showed a probable link between des and vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug in utero later in the same year the fda sent an fda drug bulletin to all us physicians advising against the use of des in pregnant women the fda also removed prevention of miscarriage as an indication for des use and added pregnancy as a contraindication for des use  on february 5 1975 the fda ordered 25mg and 100mg tablets of des withdrawn effective february 18 1975  the number of persons exposed to des during pregnancy or in utero during 19401971 is unknown but may be as high as 2 million in the united states des was also used in other countries most notably france the netherlands and great britain from the 1950s through the beginning of the 1970s des was prescribed to prepubescent girls to begin puberty and thus stop growth by closing growth plates in the bones despite its clear link to cancer doctors continued to recommend the hormone for excess height  in 1960 des was found to be more effective than androgens in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women  des was the hormonal treatment of choice for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women until 1977 when the fda approved tamoxifen a selective estrogen receptor modulator with efficacy similar to des but fewer side effects  in 1973 in an attempt to restrict offlabel use of des as a postcoital contraceptive which had become prevalent at many university health services following publication of an influential study in 1971 in jama to emergency situations such as rape an fda drug bulletin was sent to all us physicians and pharmacists that said the fda had approved under restricted conditions postcoital contraceptive use of des  in 1975 the fda said it had not actually given and never did give approval to any manufacturer to market des as a postcoital contraceptive but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a fda final rule published in 1975  to discourage offlabel use of des as a postcoital contraceptive the fda in 1975 removed des 25mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses 5mg and lower of des still approved for other indications changed to state this drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label   in the 1980s offlabel use of the yuzpe regimen of certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills superseded offlabel use of des as a postcoital contraceptive  in 1978 the fda removed postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement from their approved indications for des and other estrogens  in the 1990s the only approved indications for des were treatment of advanced prostate cancer and treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women the last remaining us manufacturer of des eli lilly stopped making and marketing it in 1997 an estimated 3 million pregnant women in the usa were prescribed des from 1941 through 1971   des was also widely prescribed to women in canada the uk europe australia and new zealand during a similar period women who were prescribed des during pregnancy have been shown to have a modestly increased risk of breast cancer and breast cancer mortality  des gained notoriety when it was shown to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug in utero in 1971 the new england journal of medicine published a report showing that seven of eight girls and young women ages 14 to 22 who had been diagnosed with vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma had been exposed prenatally to des  subsequent studies have shown an approximate 40fold increased risk of vaginalcervical clear cell adenocarcinoma in women exposed in utero to des as a consequence of this evidence des is considered an established human carcinogen des was one of the first transplacental carcinogens discovered in humans meaning a toxin could cross the placenta and harm the fetus it had originally been believed that the placenta protected the developing fetus but it is now known that is not true daughters exposed to des in utero may also have an increased risk of moderate to severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer  in addition to its carcinogenic properties des is a known teratogen an agent capable of causing malformations in daughters and sons who were exposed in utero desexposed daughters are at an increased risk of abnormalities of the reproductive tract including vaginal epithelial changes such as vaginal adenosis which means a type of cell normally found in the uterus columnar cells are also present in the vagina an increased cervical transformation zone and uterine abnormalities such as tshaped uterus these anomalies contribute to an increased risk of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes in prenatally desexposed daughters the most recent published research on des daughters adverse health outcomes documented by the us national cancer institute nci appears in the october 6 2011 issue of the new england journal of medicine under the authorship of rn hoover et al and lists these adverse effects and risk factors cumulative risks in women exposed to des as compared with those not exposed were as follows for infertility 333 vs 155 spontaneous abortion 503 vs 386 preterm delivery 533 vs 178 loss of secondtrimester pregnancy 164 vs 17 ectopic pregnancy 146 vs 29 preeclampsia 264 vs 137 stillbirth 89 vs 26 early menopause 51 vs 17 grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 69 vs 34 and breast cancer at 40 years of age or older 39 vs 22  daughters with prenatal exposure to des may also have an increased risk of uterine fibroids and incompetent cervix in adulthood  at least one published study by researchers specializing in psychosexual development has determined there is a positive association between inutero des exposure among des daughters and increased potential for a girl being homosexual or bisexual  however later studies have concluded that no clearcut differences can be demonstrated to date between unexposed and desexposed women in genderrelated behavior  and another found that des daughters were slightly more likely than unexposed women to have ever been married and were less likely to report having had a samesex sexual partner  these studies contradict earlier studies indicating an inclination towards female attraction in des daughters as well as no indication for increased prevalence of genderatypical behavior studies of des daughters have not found a link between in utero exposure to des and autoimmune diseases  in an animal model designed to study environmental estrogens des turned out to be an obesogen capable of causing adult weight gain in female mice which had been exposed to des during neonatal development the excess weight gain was not apparent at birth or in infancy but occurred in adulthood   initially fewer studies documented risks of prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol on males referred to as des sons in the 1970s and early 1980s studies published on prenatally desexposed males investigated increased risk of testicular cancer infertility and urogenital abnormalities in development such as cryptorchidism and hypospadias   research published in the us by palmer et al in 2009 further confirmed evidence of these findings  additional research published in finland in 2012 has further confirmed an increased risk of cryptorchidism among males exposed prenatally to des  the us centers for disease control cdc has acknowledged the link between diethylstilbestrol exposure and noncancerous epididymal cysts  the american association of clinical endocrinologists aace has documented that prenatal des exposure in males is positively linked to a condition known as hypogonadism low testosterone levels that may require treatment with testosterone replacement therapy  exposed males may have a greater likelihood of being lefthanded than unexposed males  research on des sons has explored the longstanding question of whether prenatal exposure to des in males may include sexual and genderrelated behavioral effects and also intersex conditions dr scott kerlin a major des researcher and founder of the des sons international research network in 1999 has documented for the past 16 years a high prevalence of individuals with confirmed prenatal des exposure who selfidentify as maletofemale transsexual transgender or have intersex conditions and many individuals who report a history of experiencing difficulties with gender dysphoria     a large us study in which recruitment was not dependent on health concerns and in which des exposure or lack of exposure was confirmed for all participants found the or odds ratio for exposed men having had a samesex sexual partner was 13  for desexposed men compared to unexposed men however no research into gender identity issues was explored in this study  various neurological changes occur after prenatal exposure of embryonic males to des and other estrogenic endocrine disrupters animals that exhibited these structural neurological changes were also shown to demonstrate various genderrelated behavioral changes socalled feminization of males several published studies in the medical literature on psychoneuroendocrinology have examined the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to estrogens including des may cause significant developmental impact on sexual differentiation of the brain and on subsequent behavioral and gender identity development in exposed males and females   there is significant evidence linking prenatal hormonal influences on gender identity and transsexual development    most of the initial research documenting the psychological effects of prenatal des exposure was poorly conducted often by mail card despite that some more carefully conducted studies show a clear link to depression   in the 1970s the negative publicity surrounding the discovery of dess longterm effects resulted in a huge wave of lawsuits in the united states against its manufacturers these culminated in a landmark 1980 decision of the supreme court of california sindell v abbott laboratories in which the court imposed a rebuttable presumption of market share liability upon all des manufacturers proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff a lawsuit was filed in boston federal court by 53 des daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of des being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them their cases survived a daubert hearing in 2013 the fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancerdes link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial the remaining litigants have received various settlements  researchers are still following the health of persons exposed to des to determine whether other health problems occur as they grow older current research also looks at des in the third generation these are the children of men and women who were exposed to des in utero thus they are also the grandchildren of women who were given des during pregnancy studies of the third generation are important because des might be associated with epigenetic changes which involve changes to the way genes behave not involving the dna itself that may be heritable from one generation to another if epigenetic changes occur and are heritable studies of the desexposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine disruptors on human health and evolution recent studies from the us national cancer institute nci show that the daughters of women who were exposed in utero to des may be less likely than the unexposed to have regular menstrual periods  a possible increased risk of infertility in the older third generation daughters was also noted the nci study provides limited evidence of an increased risk of birth defects in the sons or daughters of women who were exposed prenatally to des an increased risk of ovarian cancer in the daughters of women exposed in utero was observed but it was based on three cases of almost 800 so the finding is considered preliminary and requires further study some evidence suggests the sons of prenatally desexposed women might have an increased risk of hypospadias   but other studies suggest the increase in risk might not be as great as once thought  des is a very potent agonist of the estrogen receptors des produces paroxypropione as an active metabolite  des has been very successful in treating female canine incontinence stemming from poor sphincter control it is still available from compounding pharmacies and at the low 1mg dose does not have the carcinogenic properties that were so problematic in humans  it is generally administered once a day for seven to ten days and then once every week as needed during the 1960s des was used as a growth hormone in the beef and poultry industries it was later found to cause cancer and was phased out in the late 1970s  when des was discovered to be harmful to humans it was moved to veterinary use an account of dess use in the beef industry is depicted in the novel my year of meats by ruth l ozeki it was also prescribed as a cure for homosexuality in season 4 episode 3 of bbc series call the midwife

V potockilupski syndrome ptls also known as dup17p112p112 syndrome trisomy 17p112 or duplication 17p112 syndrome is a contiguous gene syndrome involving the microduplication of band 112 on the short arm of human chromosome 17 17p112  the duplication was first described as a case study in 1996  in 2000 the first study of the disease was released  and in 2007 enough patients had been gathered to complete a comprehensive study and give it a detailed clinical description  ptls is named for two researchers involved in the latter phases drs lorraine potocki and james r lupski of baylor college of medicine   ptls was the first predicted reciprocal of a homologous recombination microdeletion or microduplication where both reciprocal recombinations result in a contiguous gene syndrome  its reciprocal disease is smithmagenis syndrome sms in which the chromosome portion duplicated in ptls is deleted altogether  potockilupski syndrome is considered a rare disease   predicted to appear in at least 1 in 20000 humans  symptoms of the syndrome include mild mental retardation autism  and other disorders unrelated to the listed symptoms   clinically ptls presents as a milder syndrome than sms with distinct characteristics though ptls can be mistaken for sms  both syndromes are characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities and mental retardation a key feature which appears in 80 of cases is autism spectrum disorder  other unique features of potockilupski syndrome include infantile hypotonia sleep apnea structural cardiovascular anomalies cognitive deficits  abnormal social behaviors  learning disabilities attentiondeficit disorder obsessivecompulsive behaviours malocclusions short stature and failure to thrive   after noting that autism is commonly associated with ptls researchers at the centro de estudios científicos and the universidad austral de chile genetically engineered a ptls model mouse where the syntenic chromosome segment was duplicated and examined the social behaviours of these mice versus those without the anomaly the wildtype  one human autismrelated symptom is abnormal reciprocal social interaction  the researchers observed that the geneticallyengineered mice of both sexes had a slight statistically insignificant impairment of their preference of a social target ie a living breathing mouse over an inanimate one the average human will prefer the social target and preferred to explore newly introduced mice instead of familiar ones unlike the typical human and mouse preference of a friend over a stranger demonstrating a change in their liking of social novelty they also found that male mice in some scenarios showed increased anxiety and dominant behaviour than the control group anatomically the engineered mice had a decreased braintobody mass ratio and an alteration in the expression of several genes in the hippocampus   both potockilupski and smithmagenis syndromes arise through a faulty non allelic homologous recombination mechanism  both appear to involve a 1337mb chromosome section in 17p112 that includes the retinoic acid inducible 1 rai1 gene  other candidate genes have been identified within the duplicated section including srebf1 drg2 llgl1 shmt1 and zfp179  in mice of the subfamily murinae a 3234cm region of chromosome 11 is syntenic to 17p112 meaning that they contain the same genes in the same order and orientation  this conserved sequence has been exploited to learn more about sms and ptls through genetic studies on both laboratory mice and humans it has been discovered that rai1 is likely the gene responsible for these syndromes for example in one study it was shown that mice with one copy of the rai1 gene and 3 copies of each of the other 18 genes in the described translocated region of chromosome 11 appeared and behaved like the control mice with the described region intact   in other words rai1 is dosagesensitive this provides evidence that it is the number of rai1 copies present that affects the symptoms of ptls and sms it is therefore believed that rai1 is the critical gene involved in these disorders  however since no cases of rai1 duplication alone have been identified this has not been concluded  one group has noted that in a mouse model the flanking genes in the duplicated segment were also overexpressed suggesting some new candidates for analysis including mfap4 ttc19 and gja12  the duplication involved in ptls is usually large enough to be detected through gbanding alone  though there is a high false negative rate  to ascertain the diagnosis when karyotyping results are unclear or negative more sophisticated techniques such as subtelomeric fluorescent insitu hybridization analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization acgh may be used  parental support and information can be found at wwwpotockilupskisyndromeorg this site is ran by parents for parents visit for connection to over 300 families living with a child with ptls

V pachygyria from the greek pachy meaning thick or fat gyri is a congenital malformation of the cerebral hemisphere it results in unusually thick convolutions of the cerebral cortex typically children have developmental delay and seizures the onset and severity depending on the severity of the cortical malformation infantile spasms are common in affected children as is intractable epilepsy   pachygyria lissencephaly smooth brain and polymicrogyria multiple small gyri are all the results of abnormal cell migration the abnormal migration is typically associated with a disorganized cellular architecture failure to form six layers of cortical neurons a fourlayer cortex is common and functional problems the abnormal formation of the brain may be associated with seizures developmental delay and mental dysfunctions normally the brain cells begin to develop in the periventricular region germinal matrix and then migrate from medial to lateral to form the cerebral cortex the term pachygyria does not directly relate to a specific malformation but rather is used to generally describe physical characteristics of the brain in association with several neuronal migration disorders most commonly disorders relating to varied degrees of lissencephaly lissencephaly is present in 1 of 85470 births and the life span of those affected is short as only a few survive past the age of 20  pachygyria is a condition identified by a type of cortical genetic malformation clinicians will subjectively determine the malformation based on the degree of malposition and the extent of thickened abnormal grey differentiation present  different imaging modalities are commonly used for diagnosis while computed tomography ct provides higher spatial resolution imaging of the brain cerebral cortex malformations are more easily visualized in vivo and classified using magnetic resonance imaging mri which provides higher contrast imaging and better delineation of white and gray matter  diffuse pachygyria a mild form of lissencephaly can be seen on an mri as thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri and incomplete development of the sylvian fissures  cognitive ability correlates with the thickness of any subcortical band present and the degree of pachygyria   various degrees of intensity and locations of epilepsy are associated with malformations of cortical development researchers suggest that approximately 40 of children diagnosed with drugresistant epilepsy have some degree of cortical malformation   lissencephaly to which pachygyria is most closely linked is associated with severe mental retardation epilepsy and motor disability two characteristics of lissencephaly include its absence of convolutions agyria and decreased presence of convolutions pachygyria  the types of seizures associated with lissencephaly include other possible symptoms of lissencephaly include telecanthus estropia hypertelorism varying levels of mental retardation cerebellar hypoplasia corpus callosum aplasia and decreased muscle tone and tendon reflexes  over 90 of children affected with lissencephaly have seizures  patients with subcortical band heterotopia another disorder associated with pachygyria typically have milder symptoms and their cognitive function is closely linked to the thickness of the subcortical band and the degree of pachygyria present  the degree of cerebral cortex malformation caused by genetic mutations is classified by the degree of malposition and the extent of faulty grey matter differentiation  neuronal migration disorders are generally classified into three groups the other types are associated with corpus callosum agenesis or cerebellar hypoplasia while the cobblestone lissencephalies are associated with eye and muscle disorders  classical lissencephaly also known as type i or generalized agyriapachygyria is a severe brain malformation of a smooth cerebral surface abnormally thick 1020mm cortex with four layers widespread neuronal heterotopia enlarged ventricles and agenesis or malformation of the corpus callosum   classical lissencephaly can range from agyria to regional pachygyria and is usually present along with subcortical band heterotopia known as double cortex to describe the circumferential bands of heterotopic neurons located beneath the cortex  subcortical band heterotopia is a malformation slightly different from lissencephaly that is now classified under the agyriapachygyriaband spectrum because it consists of a gyral pattern consistent with broad convolutions and an increased cortical thickness  the established classification scheme for lissencephaly is based on the severity grades 16 and the gradient  grade 1 and grade 4 are very rare grade 2 is observed in children with millerdieker syndrome a combination of lissencephaly with dysmorphic facial features visceral abnormalities and polydactyly the most common lissencephaly observed consisting of frontotemporal pachygyria and posterior agyria is grade 3  another malformation worth mentioning because of its connections to pachygyria is polymicrogyria polymicrogyria is characterized by many small gyri separated by shallow sulci slightly thin cortex neuronal heterotopia and enlarged ventricle and is often superimposed on pachygyria  pachygyria is caused by a breakdown in the fetal neuronal migration process due to genetic or possibly environmental influences the affected cerebral cortex will typically have only four developed layers instead of the normal six one of the best known and most common types of neuronal migration disorders is lissencephaly a diffuse cortical malformation relating directly to agyria and pachygyria  incomplete neuronal migration during the early fetal brain development is the precursor to lissencephaly  should neurons follow an abnormal migration during development possible cortical malformations include classical lissencephaly as stated above and subcortical band heterotopia with an agyriapachygyria band spectrum  normal neuronal migration involves the development of six cortical layers each one performing distinct functions  normal cerebral development occurs in three dynamic and overlapping stages most types of incomplete neuronal migration to the cortex occur during the third and fourth gestational months  the abnormal migration of the neurons causes them to not reach their proper final destinations which results in failure of the sulci and gyri to form  the stage of cortical development at which migration is arrested is directly related to the level of structural malposition  one of the most critical stages in brain development is when the postmitotic neurons migrate from the ventricular zone to form the cortical plate  migration arrested toward the latter part of development usually restricts the abnormal cell position to the cortex level  several genetic mutations have been isolated and linked to specific malformations of the cerebral cortex  genes shown to cause lissencephaly include both autosomal and xlinked genes  below the mutations of lis1 or dcx genes are discussed as they are most commonly linked to neuronal migration disorders including lissencephalypachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia  lis1 is responsible for the autosomal form of lissencephaly  mutations of the lis1 gene are associated with about 80 of those affected with lissencephaly  lis1 was the first human neuronal migration gene to be cloned it is responsible for encoding the alpha subunit of the intracellular ib isoform of plateletactivating factor acetylhydrolase it is located on chromosome 17p133 and has 11 exons with a coding region of 1233bp lis1 protein appears to interact with tubulin to suppress microtubule dynamics the protein is highly conserved and studies have shown that it participates in cytoplasmic dyneinmediated nucleokinesis somal translocation cell motility mitosis and chromosome segregation  lis1 encodes for a 45kda protein called pafah1b1 that contains seven wd40 repeats required for proper neuronal migration  the lis1 gene encodes for a protein similar to the \u03b2 subunit of g proteins responsible for degrading bioactive lipid plateletactivating factor paf  this leads to theories that lis1 might exert its effect on migration through microtubules specific concentrations of paf may be necessary for optimal neuronal migration by influencing cell morphology adhesion properties studies have shown that addition of paf or inhibition of plateletactivating factor acetylhydrolase pafah decreases cerebellar granule cell migration in vitro addition of paf to hippocampal cells have shown growth cone collapse and neurite retraction lis1 knockout homozygous null mice die during embryogenesis and heterozygous mice survive with delayed neuronal migration confirmed by in vitro and in vivo cell migration assays  most lissencephaly cases are associated with deletions of mutations of the lis1 gene and the results are usually more severe in the posterior brain regions  one study showed that of an isolated group of patients with lissencephaly 40 resulted from an lis1 deletion and another 25 resulted from an intragenic mutation of the gene patients with missense mutations tend to have less severe symptoms pachygyria and rare cases of subcortical band heterotopia truncated shortened mutations of lis1 tend to cause severe lissencephaly  doublecortin dcx or xlis mutations are responsible for xlinked disorders  while lis1 mutations tend to cause severe malformations in the posterior brain dcx mutations focus much of their destruction on anterior malformations and are linked to lissencephaly in males and subcortical band heterotopias in females   women with dcx mutations tend to have an anteriorlypredominant subcortical band heterotopia and pachygyria    dcx was the first known gene causing xlinked lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia it is found on chromosome xq223q23 and has nine exons that code for 360 proteins dcx is expressed exclusively in the fetal brain  spastic for details on the most common form of cerebral palsy see spastic diplegia spastic cerebral palsy is by far the most common type occurring in 70 to 80 of all cases moreover spastic cp accompanies one of the other types in 30 of all cases people with this type are hypertonic and have a neuromuscular condition stemming from damage to the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex that affects the nervous systems ability to receive gamma amino butyric acid in the areas affected by the disability spastic cp is further classified by topography dependent on the region of the body affected these include spastic hemiplegia one side being affected generally injury to musclenerves controlled by the brains left side will cause a right body deficit and vice versa typically people that have spastic hemiplegia are the most ambulatory although they generally have dynamic equinus on the affected side and are primarily prescribed anklefoot orthoses to prevent said equinus11 spastic diplegia the lower extremities are affected with little to no upperbody spasticity the most common form of the spastic forms most people with spastic diplegia are fully ambulatory and have a scissors gait flexed knees and hips to varying degrees are common hip problems dislocations and in threequarters of spastic diplegics also strabismus crossed eyes can be present as well in addition these individuals are often nearsighted the intelligence of a person with spastic diplegia is unaffected by the condition spastic tetraplegia all four limbs affected equally people with spastic quadriplegia are the least likely to be able to walk or if they can to want to walk because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement occasionally terms such as monoplegia paraplegia triplegia and pentaplegia may also be used to refer to specific manifestations of the spasticity because pachygyria is a structural defect no treatments are currently available other than symptomatic treatments especially for associated seizures another common treatment is a gastrostomy insertion of a feeding tube to reduce possible poor nutrition and repeated aspiration pneumonia  microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism mopd type ii is an autosomal multisystem disorder including severe pre and postnatal growth retardation microcephaly with seckel syndromelike facial appearance and distinctive skeletal alterations usually those affected have mild to moderate mental retardation this female child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents at 35 weeks gestation through a cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation she had a retarded psychomotor development and was repeatedly hospitalized during her first six months of life due to recurring respiratory infections her electroencephalography auditory brainstem response evaluation and chromosomal analysis were relatively normal a brain mri revealed thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri prominently in the frontal and posterior temporal regions incomplete development of the sylvian fissures and dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles colpocephaly usually only mild brain malformations are associated with mopd type ii the imaging findings of this childs brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria a mild form of lissencephaly this childs neurodevelopmental findings were mild when compared to previous reports of a welldefined chromosome 17linked and xlinked

V encephalocele sometimes known by the latin name cranium bifidum is a neural tube defect characterized by saclike protrusions of the brain and the membranes that cover it through openings in the skull these defects are caused by failure of the neural tube to close completely during fetal development encephaloceles cause a groove down the middle of the skull or between the forehead and nose or on the back side of the skull the severity of encephalocele varies depending on its location    encephaloceles are often accompanied by craniofacial abnormalities or other brain malformations symptoms may include neurologic problems hydrocephalus cerebrospinal fluid accumulated in the brain spastic quadriplegia paralysis of the limbs microcephaly an abnormally small head ataxia uncoordinated muscle movement developmental delay vision problems mental and growth retardation and seizures a neonate with a large encephalocele encephalocele on the head of a twoyearold although the exact cause is unknown encephaloceles are caused by failure of the neural tube to close completely during fetal development research has indicated that teratogens substances known to cause birth defects trypan blue a stain used to color dead tissues or cells blue and arsenic may damage the developing fetus and cause encephaloceles  proper levels of folic acid have been shown to help prevent such defects when taken before pregnancy and early in pregnancy  usually encephaloceles are noticeable deformities and are diagnosed immediately after birth but a small encephalocele in the nasal or forehead region can go undetected various physical and mental developmental delays can indicate the presence of encephaloceles encephaloceles of the face are generally classified as nasofrontal nasoethmoidal or nasoorbital however there can be some overlap in the type of encephalocele they can also appear along any part of the cranial vault as they result from abnormal closure of cranial bones the most common location for enncephaloceles is the occipital region if the bulging portion contains only cerebrospinal fluid and the overlaying membrane it may be called a meningocele if brain tissue is present it may be referred to as a meningoencephalocele  it is recommended that women who may become pregnant take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily  1 2 3 4 5 6 currently the only effective treatment for encephaloceles is reparative surgery generally performed during infancy the extent to which it can be corrected depends on the location and size of the encephaloceles however large protrusions can be removed without causing major disability surgery repositions the bulging area back into the skull removes the protrusions and corrects the deformities typically relieving pressure that can delay normal brain development occasionally shunts are placed to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain  the goals of treatment include recovery is difficult to predict prior to surgery and depends on the type of brain tissue involved and location of the encephaloceles if surgery is successful and developmental delays have not occurred a patient can develop normally where neurologic and developmental damage has occurred the specialists will focus on minimizing both mental and physical disabilities in general when the bulging material consists of primarily cerebrospinal fluid a complete recovery can occur when a large amount of brain tissue is present in the encephaloceles there is a higher chance of perioperative complication encephaloceles occur rarely at a rate of one per 5000 live births worldwide encephaloceles of the back of the head are more common in europe and north america while encephaloceles on the front of the head more frequently occur in southeast asia africa malaysia and russia ethnic genetic and environmental factors as well as parental age can all affect the likelihood of encephaloceles the condition can occur in families with a family history of spina bifida

V craniopagus parasiticus is an extremely rare type of parasitic twinning occurring in about 4 to 6 of 10000000 births  in craniopagus parasiticus a parasitic twin head with an undeveloped body is attached to the head of a developed twin fewer than a dozen cases of this type of conjoined twin have been documented in the literature most infants with this condition are stillborn or die shortly after birth    in the past the use of terminology when describing parasitic twins has been somewhat inconsistent by definition a parasitic twin is joined to another twin in a certain anatomical location or position on the developed twins body the underdeveloped twin is termed the parasite and the developed twin is termed the autosite the autosite can have some abnormalities as well for the most part however it has developed enough to where it can live on its own  only ten cases of craniopagus parasiticus have been reported in the medical research literature of those cases only three have survived birth  the first case on record is that of everard homes two headed boy of bengal whose head is now preserved at the hunterian museum at the royal society of surgeons  the exact development of craniopagus parasiticus is not well known however it is known that the underdeveloped twin is a parasitic twin parasitic twins are known to occur in utero when monozygotic twins start to develop as an embryo but the embryo fails to completely split when this happens one embryo will dominate development while the others development is severely altered the key difference between a parasitic twin and conjoined twins is that in parasitic twins one twin the parasite stops development during gestation whereas the other twin the autosite develops completely  in normal monozygotic twin development one embryo is fertilized by a single sperm the egg will then completely split into two normally at the twocell stage if the egg splits in the early blastocyst stage two inner cell masses will be present eventually leading to the twins sharing the same chorion and placenta but with separate amnions however the egg can split into two but still have one blastocyst this will lead to one inner cell mass and one blastocyst then as the twins develop they will share the same placenta chorion and amnion  this is thought to be the most likely reason why conjoined twins occur  and could possibly play a role in the development of craniopagus parasiticus  one hypothesis is that craniopagus parasiticus starts with the development of two fetuses from a single zygote that fail to separate at the head region around the second week of gestation  some  believe however that it occurs later in development around the fourth week of gestation at which time the two embryos fuse together near the anterior open neuropore  another hypothesis is that there is joining of the somatic and placental vascular system of the twins as well as a degeneration of the umbilical cord of the parasitic twin this suggests that craniopagus parasiticus develops due to the lack of blood supply to one of the twins  the condition also seems to be more predominant in males than females with seven of the nine 78 reported cases being male with the number of cases being so small it is hard to say whether this data has any significance  however it might provide some insight into the possibility of a genetic predisposition to the condition  with so few individuals actually surviving until birth the only treatment option is surgery to try to remove the parasitic twin surgery however is very dangerous and has been successful only once the problem with surgical intervention is that the arterial supplies of the head are so intertwined that it is very hard to control the bleeding and it has been suggested that cutting off the parasitic twins arterial supply might improve the odds of the developed twins survival  only ten cases of craniopagus parasiticus have been documented out of a total of at least eighty known cases of craniopagus in general  only three cases have been documented by modern medicine to have survived birth in addition to craniopagus parasiticus a few other conditions involve a childs or animals birth with two heads or faces dicephalus parapagus is a condition where two heads are side by side on a single torso with varying degrees of twinning of organs and structures within the torso  diprosopus occurs when a single body and neck are present but there is a duplication of the structures of the face this is different from craniopagus parasiticus in that there is only one head although there is a duplication of the craniofacial features diprosopus can range from having two fully formed faces to just a duplication of the nose or eyes

V sitosterolemia also known as phytosterolemia   is a rare autosomal recessively inherited lipid metabolic disorder it is characterized by hyperabsorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols leading to hypercholesterolemia tendon and tuberous xanthomas premature development of atherosclerosis and abnormal hematologic and liver function test results   around 80 cases have been reported in the literature worldwide hence this condition appears to be relatively rare more than likely sitosterolemia is significantly underdiagnosed and many patients are probably misdiagnosed with hyperlipidemia sitosterolemia may share several clinical characteristics with the wellcharacterized familial hypercholesterolemia fh such as the development of tendon xanthomas in the first 10 years of life and the development of premature atherosclerosis  however in contrast to fh patients sitosterolemia patients usually have normal to moderately elevated total sterol levels and very high levels of plant sterols sitosterol campesterol stigmasterol avenosterol and 5\u03b1saturated stanols in their plasma plasma sitosterol levels in sitosterolemia patients are 1025 times higher than in normal individuals 860mgdl not all patients with sitosterolemia have tendon xanthomas thus absence of this should not be used to exclude this diagnosis xanthomas may appear at any age even in childhood these may be present as subcutaneous xanthomas on the buttocks in children or in usual locations eg achilles tendon extensor tendons of the hand in children and adultsxanthelasma and corneal arcus are less commondecreased range of motion with possible redness swelling and warmth of joints due to arthritis may be presentin addition sitosterolemia patients may develop hemolytic episodes and splenomegaly untreated the condition causes a significant increase in morbidity and mortality coronary heart disease and its inherent health consequences are the primary causes of illness and premature death in untreated patients mammalian cells cannot use plant sterols normally plant sterols are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract fewer than 5 of plant sterols are absorbed compared to approximately 40 of cholesterol absorbed the liver preferentially excretes plant sterols over cholesterol dietary sterols have recently been shown to passively enter intestinal cells and subsequently the vast majority are pumped back into the gut lumen by atpbinding cassette transporter abc transporter proteins sitosterolemia is inherited as a rare autosomal recessive condition it has been shown to result from mutations in either of two adjacent and oppositely oriented genes abcg5 and abcg8 located in chromosome 2 in band 2p21 and encode for abc transporter proteins named sterolin1 and sterolin2 respectively thus the active pumping back into the intestine of passively absorbed plant sterols is disrupted and hepatic secretion of the resultant accumulation of these sterols is decreased the ability of the liver to preferentially excrete plant sterols into the bile is apparently impaired while bile acid synthesis remains the same as in healthy people the total excretion of sterols in the bile is reportedly less than 50 in subjects with sitosterolemia compared to control subjects the mechanism for decreased hepatic secretion is unknown patients have markedly reduced wholebody cholesterol biosynthesis associated with suppressed hepatic ileal and mononuclear leukocyte hydroxymethylglutarylcoenzyme a reductase hmgcoa reductase the ratecontrolling enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway whether or not the downregulation is due to accumulated sitosterol is still debatable but most recent data indicate that secondary effects of unknown regulators other than sitosterol can lead to reduced hmgcoa reductase activity in the disease this is coupled with significantly increased lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptor expression the disorder is treated by strictly reducing the intake of foods rich in plant sterols eg vegetable oils olives and avocados however dietary therapy is never sufficient to control this disease since plant sterols are constituents of all plantbased foods statins have been used and while these lower cholesterol levels and may ameliorate atherosclerotic disease plant sterol levels are insufficiently lowered by their use alone if dietary treatment alone is insufficient bile acidbinding resins eg cholestyramine colestipol could be considered in october 2002 a new cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe received us food and drug administration fda approval for use in sitosterolemia this drug is now the standard of care as it blocks sterol entry and can be used in combination with bileacid resins finally ileal bypass has been performed in select cases to decrease the levels of plant sterols in the body though this therapy was undertaken prior to the advent of ezetimibe efficacy of treatment should be monitored by regular determinations of plant sterol measurements

V a mongolian spot also known as mongolian blue spot congenital dermal melanocytosis  and dermal melanocytosis  is a benign flat congenital birthmark with wavy borders and irregular shape in 1883 it was described and named after mongolians by erwin bälz a german anthropologist based in japan     it normally disappears three to five years after birth and almost always by puberty  the most common color is blue although they can be bluegray blueblack or deep brown   the mongolian spot is a congenital developmental condition  that is one existing from birth  exclusively involving the skin the blue colour is caused by melanocytes melanincontaining cells that are usually located in the surface of the skin the epidermis but are in the deeper region the dermis in the location of the spot  usually as multiple spots or one large patch it covers one or more of the lumbosacral area lower back the buttocks sides and shoulders  it results from the entrapment of melanocytes in the lower half to twothirds of the dermis during their migration from the neural crest to the epidermis during embryonic development  male and female infants are equally predisposed to mongolian spot  people who are not aware of the background of the mongolian spots may mistake them for bruises possibly resulting in unfounded concerns about abuse    infants may be born with one or more mongolian spots ranging from small area on the buttocks to a larger area on the back the spot is prevalent among east southeast north and central asian peoples malay archipelago islanders indigenous oceanians chiefly micronesians and polynesians africans  amerindians  east africans latin americans and caribbeans of mixedrace descent and turkish people    they occur in about 9095 of asian and 8085 native american infants  approximately 90 of polynesians and micronesians are born with mongolian spots as are about 46 of children in latin america  where they are associated with noneuropean descent these spots also appear on 510 of babies of full caucasian descent coria del río in spain has a high incidence due to the presence of descendants of the first japanese official envoy to spain in the early 17th century   black babies have mongolian spots at a frequency of 96  almost the entire mestizo mixed spanishindian people of mexico have the mongolian spot  central americans indigenous children were subjected to racism due to their mongolian spots but progressive circles began to make having the mongolian spot popular after the late 1960s  highland peruvians have the mongolian spot  the french anthropologist robert gessain interested himself in what he called the tache pigmentaire congenitale or coloured birthmark publishing multiple papers in the journal de la société des américanistes an academic journal covering the cultural anthropology of the americas gessain spent time with the huehuetla tepehua people in hidalgo mexico and wrote in 1947 about the spots location shape colour histology chemistry genetic transmission and racial distribution he had previously spent several winters in greenland and wrote an overview in 1953 of what was known about the spot he hypothesised that the age at which it faded in various populations might prove to be a distinguishing characteristic of those groups gessain claimed that the spot was first observed amongst the eskimo  hans egede saabye a danish priest and botanist spent 17701778 in greenland his diaries published in 1816 and translated into several european languages contained much ethnographic information he described the spot on newborns saying he had seen it often when the infants were presented naked for baptism a second danish observer was doctor and zoologist daniel frederik eschricht mainly based in copenhagen in 1849 he wrote of the mixed babies he had delivered at the lyingin hospital he also says that the observation made for the first time by saabye about eskimo children has been completely confirmed by captain holbøll who sent him a fetus pickled in alcohol   gessain goes on to state that it was only in 1883 that an anthropologist mentions the spot it was erwin bälz a german working in tokyo who described a dark blue mark on japanese infants he presented his findings in 1901 in berlin and from that point on bälzs name was associated with certain skin cells containing pigment captain gustav frederik holm wrote in 1887 that his greenlandic interpreter johannes hansen known as hanserak attested to the existence of the birthmark over the kidney region of newborns which grows larger as they grow older that year the danish anthropologist soren hansen drew the connection between the observations of bälz in japan and saabye in greenland this cannot be a coincidence it is not the first time that the resemblance between the japanese and the eskimo has been pointed out fridtjof nansen the norwegian polar explorer said that the spot was widespread in the mixed danisheskimo population of west greenland soren hansen confirmed this and further hypothesised that in both japan and greenland the spot might indicate an african connection a sign of direct descent from a black racial element see historical race concepts a missionary in bethel alaska a traditional gathering place of yupik people reported that the spots were common on children rudolf trebitsh an austrian linguist and ethnologist spent the summer of 1906 on the west coast of greenland and listed all the examples he came across gessain went to north labrador in 1926 looking for children with these spots in 1953 dr saxtorph medical advisor to the greenland department part of the danish government wrote that the greenlanders do not like outsiders to see or discuss these birthmarks they doubtless feel as a reminiscence of the time when they lived on a low cultural level   the presence or absence of the mongolian spot was used by racial theorists such as joseph deniker 18521918 the french anthropologist  the journal of cutaneous diseases including syphilis volume 23 contained several accounts of the mongolian spot on children in the americas a marriage between a chinese man and a white mexican woman was recorded in current anthropological literature volumes 12 published in 1912 titled note on two children born to a chinese and a mexican white note sur deux enfants nes dun chinois et d une

began to walk at ten months the girl a little after a year       the mongolian spot is referred to in the japanese idiom shiri ga aoi \u5c3b\u304c\u9752\u3044 meaning to have a blue butt   which is a reference to immaturity or inexperience in mexico where its name is the green butt spanish rabo verde it is referred to as la patada de cuauhtémoc meaning cuauhtémocs kick korean mythology explains

V situs inversus also called situs transversus or oppositus is a congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions the normal arrangement of internal organs is known as situs solitus while situs inversus is generally the mirror image of situs solitus although cardiac problems are more common than in the general population most people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications resulting from the condition and until the advent of modern medicine it was usually undiagnosed situs inversus is found in about 001 of the population or about 1 person in 10000 in the most common situation situs inversus totalis it involves complete transposition right to left reversal of all of the abdominal organs the heart is not in its usual position in the left chest but is on the right a condition known as dextrocardia literally righthearted because the relationship between the organs is not changed most people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications although they should wear a medical identification tag to warn emergency medical staff that the patients internal organs are reversed from normal so they can act accordingly eg by listening for a heartbeat on the right rather than left side of the chest  in rarer cases such as situs ambiguus or heterotaxy situs cannot be determined in these patients the liver may be midline the spleen absent or multiple and the bowel malrotated often structures are duplicated or absent altogether this is more likely to cause medical problems than situs inversus totalis    in the absence of congenital heart defects individuals with situs inversus are phenotypically normal and can live normal healthy lives without any complications related to their medical condition there is a 5 10 prevalence of congenital heart disease in individuals with situs inversus totalis most commonly transposition of the great vessels the incidence of congenital heart disease is 95 in situs inversus with levocardia many people with situs inversus totalis are unaware of their unusual anatomy until they seek medical attention for an unrelated condition the reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion as many signs and symptoms will be on the atypical side for example if an individual with situs inversus develops appendicitis they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain since that is where their appendix lies   thus in the event of a medical problem the knowledge that the individual has situs inversus can expedite diagnosis people with this rare condition may inform their physicians before an examination so the physician can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs wearing a medical identification tag can help to inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate situs inversus also complicates organ transplantation operations as donor organs will more likely come from situs solitus normal donors as hearts and livers are chiral geometric problems arise placing an organ into a cavity shaped in the mirror image for example a person with situs inversus who requires a heart transplant needs all the vessels to the transplant donor heart reattached to their existing ones however the orientation of these vessels in a person with situs inversus is reversed necessitating steps so that the blood vessels join properly situs inversus is generally an autosomal recessive genetic condition although it can be xlinked or found in identical mirror image twins   about 25 of individuals with situs inversus have an underlying condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia pcd pcd is a dysfunction of the cilia that manifests itself during the embryologic phase of development normally functioning cilia determine the position of the internal organs during early embryological development and so embryos with pcd have a 50 chance of developing situs inversus if they do they are said to have kartagener syndrome characterized by the triad of situs inversus chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis cilia are also responsible for clearing mucus from the lung and the dysfunction causes increased susceptibility to lung infections kartagener syndrome can also manifest with male infertility as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function the condition affects all major structures within the thorax and abdomen generally the organs are simply transposed through the sagittal plane the heart is located on the right side of the thorax the stomach and spleen on the right side of the abdomen and the liver and gall bladder on the left side the hearts normal right atrium occurs on the left and the left atrium is on the right the lung anatomy is reversed and the left lung has 3 lobes while the right lung has 2 lobes the intestines and other internal structures are also reversed from the normal and the blood vessels nerves and lymphatics are also transposed if the heart is swapped to the right side of the thorax it is known as situs inversus with dextrocardia or situs inversus totalis if the heart remains on the normal left side of the thorax a much more rare condition 1 in 2000000 of the general population it is known as situs inversus with levocardia or situs inversus incompletus dextrocardia the heart being located on the right side of the thorax was first seen and drawn by leonardo da vinci in 14521519  and then recognised by marco aurelio severino in 1643 however situs inversus was first described more than a century later by matthew baillie  the term situs inversus is a short form of the latin phrase situs inversus viscerum meaning inverted position of the internal organs notable individuals with documented cases of situs inversus

V hypospadias ha\u026apo\u028a\u02c8spe\u026ad\u026a\u0259s   refers to a birth defect of the urethra in the male where the urinary opening is not at the usual location on the head of the penis it is the second most common birth abnormality in boys affecting approximately 1 of every 250  in approximately 90 of cases the opening meatus is on or near the head of the penis glans referred to as distal hypospadias while the remainder have proximal hypospadias with a meatus near or within the scrotum shiny tissue seen extending from the meatus to the tip of the glans which would have made the urinary channel is referred to as the urethral plate in most cases the foreskin is also underdeveloped and does not wrap completely around the penis leaving the underside of the glans penis uncovered there may also be downward bending of the penis commonly referred to as chordee  this is found in 10 of distal hypospadias  and 50 of proximal hypospadias  at the time of surgery the scrotum may be higher than usual to either side of the penis called penoscrotal transposition adding to the abnormal overall appearance hypospadias is thought to result from failure of the urinary channel to completely tubularize to the end of the penis the cause of hypospadias is not known most often it is the only abnormal finding although in about 10 of cases hypospadias may be part of a syndrome with multiple abnormalities   the most common associated defect is an undescended testicle which has been reported in approximately 3 of infants with distal hypospadias and 10 of those having proximal hypospadias  the combination of hypospadias and an undescended testicle sometimes indicates a disorder of sexual differentiation and so additional testing may be recommended   otherwise no blood tests or xrays are routinely needed in newborns with hypospadias    hypospadias is thought to result from failure of the urinary channel to completely tubularize to the end of the penis the cause of hypospadias is not known most often it is the only abnormal finding although in about 10 of cases hypospadias may be part of a syndrome with multiple abnormalities   the most common associated defect is an undescended testicle which has been reported in approximately 3 of infants with distal hypospadias and 10 of those having proximal hypospadias  the combination of hypospadias and an undescended testicle sometimes indicates a disorder of sexual differentiation and so additional testing may be recommended   otherwise no blood tests or xrays are routinely needed in newborns with hypospadias  hypospadias is usually diagnosed in the newborn nursery by the characteristic appearance of the penis the urinary opening meatus is lower than normal and most boys have only partial development of the foreskin lacking the normal covering for the glans on the underside the abnormal hooded foreskin calls attention to the condition however not all newborns with partial foreskin development have hypospadias as some have a normal urinary opening with a hooded foreskin which is called chordee without hypospadias megameatus with intact prepuce mip variant of hypospadias occurs when the foreskin is normal and there is a concealed hypospadias the condition is discovered during newborn circumcision or later in childhood when the foreskin begins to retract a newborn with normalappearing foreskin and a straight penis who is discovered to have hypospadias after a circumcision was started can have circumcision completed without worry for jeopardizing future hypospadias repair   hypospadias discovered after a circumcision is almost never a result of injury during the circumcision the treatment usually recommended for hypospadias is surgery with the goal to restore normal appearance and function to the penis a urinary opening that is not surrounded by glans tissue is more likely to spray the urine which can cause a man to sit to urinate because he cannot reliably stand and hit the toilet downward curvature of the penis can impair sexual activity as an adult in addition the partially developed foreskin looks neither circumcised nor natural surgery extends the urinary channel to the end of the penis straightens bending and corrects the foreskin abnormality by either circumcision or by repairing it to look normal prepucioplasty depending on the desire of caregivers when the hypospadias is third degree or there are associated birth defects such as chordee or cryptorchidism the best management can be a more complicated decision a karyotype and endocrine evaluation should be performed to detect intersex conditions or hormone deficiencies if the penis is small testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin hcg injections may be given to enlarge it before surgery  surgical repair of severe hypospadias may require multiple procedures and mucosal grafting preputial skin is often used for grafting and circumcision should be avoided before repair in a minority of patients with severe hypospadias surgery produces unsatisfactory results such as scarring curvature or formation of urethral fistulas diverticula or strictures a fistula is an unwanted opening through the skin along the course of the urethra and can result in urinary leakage or an abnormal stream a diverticulum is an outpocketing of the lining of the urethra which interferes with urinary flow and may result in posturination leakage a stricture is a narrowing of the urethra severe enough to obstruct flow reduced complication rates even for third degree repair eg fistula rates below 5 have been reported in recent years from centers with the most experience and surgical repair is now performed for the vast majority of infants with hypospadias  hypospadias repair can be done in fullterm healthy infants at any time from 3 months of age premature babies generally have surgery done at 6 months or older using these guidelines most babies can undergo repair as same day surgery without need to stay in the hospital afterwards the results of surgery are probably not influenced by the age at which repair is done   but older boys are more likely to recall the event teens and adults typically spend one night in the hospital after surgery hormones potentially increase the size of the penis and have been used in boys with proximal hypospadias who have a smaller penis numerous articles report testosterone injections or topical creams increase the length and circumference of the penis however few studies discuss the impact of this treatment on the success of corrective surgery with conflicting results   therefore the role if any for preoperative hormone stimulation is not clear at this time hypospadias repair is done under general anesthesia most often supplemented by a nerve block to the penis or a caudal block in order to reduce the general anesthesia needed and to minimize discomfort after surgery there are many techniques which have been used during the past 100 years to extend the urinary channel to the correct location today the most common operation known as the tubularized incised plate or tip repair rolls the urethral plate from the low meatus to the end of the glans this procedure can be used for all distal hypospadias repairs with complications afterwards expected in less than 10 of cases   there is less consensus regarding proximal hypospadias repair  tip repair can be used when the penis is straight or has mild downward curvature with success in 85  alternatively the urinary channel can be reconstructed using the foreskin with reported success in from 55 to 75   most distal and many proximal hypospadias are corrected in a single operation however those with the most severe condition having a urinary opening in the scrotum and downward bending of the penis are often corrected in a 2stage operation during the first operation the curvature is straightened at the second the urinary channel is completed example of penis with hypospadias penis with hypospadias 1 and two fistulae 2 most boys having hypospadias repair heal without complications this is especially true for distal hypospadias operations which are successful in over 90 of cases problems that can arise include a small hole in the urinary channel below the meatus called a fistula the head of the penis which is open at birth in boys with hypospadias and is closed around the urinary channel at surgery sometimes reopens known as glans dehiscence the new urinary opening can scar resulting in meatal stenosis or internal scarring can create a stricture either of which cause partial blockage to urinating if the new urinary channel balloons when urinating a child is diagnosed with a diverticulum most complications are discovered within six months after surgery although they occasionally are not found for many years in general when there are no apparent problems after repair in childhood new complications arising after puberty are uncommon however some problems that were not adequately repaired in childhood may become more pronounced when the penis grows at puberty such as residual penile curvature or urine spraying due to glans dehiscence these complications are usually successfully corrected with another operation most often delayed for at least six months after the last surgery to allow the tissues to heal sufficiently before attempting another repair using modern surgical techniques a normal appearing penis can usually be expected from hypospadias repair results when circumcision or foreskin reconstruction are done are the same and so caregivers can choose whichever option they wish   figure 4a 4b while most hypospadias repairs are done in boys occasionally an adult was not operated and then desires surgery because of urinary spraying or unhappiness with the appearance other adults wanting surgery have complications that were never fully corrected during childhood there has been a general opinion that operations done in adults are less successful than those in boys for that reason some adults have been discouraged from having corrective surgery however a direct comparison of surgical results in boys versus men found they had the same outcomes and therefore men can undergo hypospadias repair or reoperations with good expectations for success  hypospadias is among the most common birth defects in the world and is said to be the second most common birth defect in boys occurring 1 in every 250 births  due to variations in the reporting requirements of different national databases data from such registries can not be used to accurately determine either incidence of hypospadias or geographical variations in its occurrences

V a cervical rib in humans is a supernumerary or extra rib which arises from the seventh cervical vertebra sometimes known as neck ribs  their presence is a congenital abnormality located above the normal first rib a cervical rib is estimated to occur in 06 1 in 150 people  to 08  of the population individuals may have a cervical rib on the right left or both sides  most cases of cervical ribs are not clinically relevant and do not have symptoms cervical ribs are generally discovered incidentally   however they vary widely in size and shape  and in rare cases they may cause problems such as contributing to thoracic outlet syndrome because of pressure on the nerves that may be caused by the presence of the rib  a cervical rib represents a persistent ossification of the c7 lateral costal element during early development this ossified costal element typically becomes reabsorbed failure of this process results in a variably elongated transverse process or complete rib that can be anteriorly fused with the t1 first rib below    the presence of a cervical rib can cause a form of thoracic outlet syndrome due to compression of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus or subclavian artery these structures become encroached upon by the cervical rib and scalene muscles compression of the brachial plexus may be identified by weakness of the muscles around the muscles in the hand near the base of the thumb compression of the subclavian artery is often diagnosed by finding a positive adsons sign on examination where the radial pulse in the arm is lost during abduction and external rotation of the shoulder a positive adsons sign is nonspecific for the presence of a cervical rib however as many individuals without a cervical rib will have a positive test many vertebrates especially reptiles have cervical ribs as a normal part of their anatomy rather than a pathological condition some sauropods had exceptionally long cervical ribs those of mamenchisaurus hochuanensis were nearly 4 meters long in birds the cervical ribs are small and completely fused to the vertebrae in mammals the ventral parts of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae are the fusedon cervical ribs recent studies have also found a high percent of cervical ribs in woolly mammoths it is believed that the decline in mammoth numbers may have forced inbreeding within the species which in turn has increased the number of mammoths being born with cervical ribs cervical ribs have been connected with leukaemia in children humans so it has given scientists new evidence to believe that the mammoths extinction was attributed to the condition

V hereditary pancreatitis hp is an inflammation of the pancreas attributed to genetic causes it was first described in 1952 by comfort and steinberg  but it was not until 1996 that whitcomb et al  isolated the first responsible mutation in the trypsinogen gene prss1 on the long arm of chromosome seven 7q35 the term hereditary pancreatitis is used when a genetic biomarker is identified and familial pancreatitis otherwise    hp is characterised by attacks of epigastric pain which are often associated with nausea and vomiting symptoms may start shortly after birth but onset varies periodically with some patients not exhibiting symptoms until adulthood there is usually progression to chronic pancreatitis with endocrine and exocrine failure and a mortally increased risk of pancreatic cancer lifetime risk of cancer has been variously calculated as 3554    to the age of 75 years and screening for early pancreatic cancer is being offered to hp sufferers on a scientific basis  some patients may choose to have their pancreas surgically removed to prevent pancreatic cancer from developing in the future  the epidemiology of hp follows a similar pattern to alcoholassociated chronic pancreatitis but there are important differences for example hp typically has an earlier age of pancreatitis onset although malabsorption and diabetes mellitus occur at a later stage in the disease progression  families are defined as having hp  if the phenotype is consistent with highly penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance in simple terms this would require two or more first degree relatives or three or more second degree relatives to have unexplained recurrentacute or chronic pancreatitis in two or more generations it is an autosomal dominant disease with penetrance that is generally accepted to be 80   the vast majority of the cases of hp are caused by substitutions at base 365 c365ga and base 86 of the cdna c86at on the prss1 gene the nucleotide substitutions were discovered in the late 1990s by classical linkage analysis   and are now known as pr122h and pn29i respectively according to the amino acid substitution and position in the protein sequence these mutations are rarely identified in general screens of patients with idiopathic disease     and the phenotype of pr122h and pn29i is now well characterised    with the pa16v mutation recently characterised for the first time  there are many other rare mutations or polymorphisms of prss1 which remain less well understood   and not all hp families have had the responsible genetic mutation identified the mechanism by which these genetic mutations cause pancreatitis is not yet known but is likely to be the result of increased autoactivation  or reduced deactivation  of trypsinogen however a novel mechanism has recently been identified in a pr116c kindred

V a preauricular sinus also known as a congenital auricular fistula a congenital preauricular fistula an ear pit   or a preauricular cyst  is a common congenital malformation characterized by a nodule dent or dimple located anywhere adjacent to the external ear  frequency of preauricular sinus differs depending on race 019 in the us 09 in the uk and 410 in asia and parts of africa frequency is known to be higher in african americans and asians compared to caucasians  they are inherited features and usually appear on one side but may be present on both sides in 25 to 50 of cases    preauricular sinuses and cysts result from developmental defects of the first and second pharyngeal arches  this and other congenital ear malformations are sometimes associated with renal anomalies  in rare cases they may be associated with branchiootorenal syndrome occasionally a preauricular sinus or cyst can become infected  most preauricular sinuses are asymptomatic and remain untreated unless they become infected too often  preauricular cysts are treated with surgery which because of their close proximity to the facial nerve is performed by an experienced surgeon such as an otolaryngologist a head and neck specialist

V an arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection or passageway between an artery and a vein it may be congenital surgically created for hemodialysis treatments or acquired due to pathologic process such as trauma or erosion of an arterial aneurysm   when an arteriovenous fistula is formed involving a major artery like the abdominal aorta it can lead to a large decrease in peripheral resistance this lowered peripheral resistance causes the heart to increase cardiac output to maintain proper blood flow to all tissues the physical manifestations of this would be a relatively normal systolic blood pressure with a decreased diastolic blood pressure resulting in a wide pulse pressure normal blood flow in the brachial artery is 85 to 110 milliliters per minute mlmin after the creation of a fistula the blood flow increases to 400500 mlmin immediately and 7001000 mlmin within 1 month a bracheocephalic fistula above the elbow has a greater flow rate than a radiocephalic fistula at the wrist both the artery and the vein dilate and elongate in response to the greater blood flow and shear stress but the vein dilates more and becomes arterialized in one study the cephalic vein increased from 23mm to 63mm diameter after 2 months when the vein is large enough to allow cannulation the fistula is defined as mature   an arteriovenous fistula can increase preload  av shunts also decrease the afterload of the heart this is because the blood bypasses the arterioles which results in a decrease in the total peripheral resistance tpr av shunts increase both the rate and volume of blood returning to the heart just like berry aneurysm an intracerebral arteriovenous fistula can rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage

V boomerang dysplasia is a lethal form of osteochondrodysplasia  known for a characteristic congenital feature in which bones of the arms and legs are malformed into the shape of a boomerang  death usually occurs in early infancy due to complications arising from overwhelming systemic bone malformations  osteochondrodysplasias are skeletal disorders that cause malformations of both bone and cartilage   prenatal and neonatal diagnosis of boomerang dysplasia includes several prominent features found in other osteochondrodysplasias though the boomerang malformation seen in the long bones is the delineating factor  featured symptoms of boomerang dysplasia include dwarfism  a lethal type of infantile dwarfism caused by systemic bone deformities  underossification lack of bone formation in the limbs spine and ilium pelvis  proliferation of multinucleated giantcell chondrocytes cells that produce cartilage and play a role in skeletal development  chondrocytes of this type are rarely found in osteochondrodysplasias  brachydactyly shortened fingers and micromelia undersized shortened bones  the characteristic boomerang malformation presents intermittently among random absences of long bones throughout the skeleton in affected individuals   for example one individual may have an absent radius and fibula with the boomerang formation found in both ulnas and tibias  another patient may present boomerang femora and an absent tibia  mutations in the filamin b flnb gene cause boomerang dysplasia  flnb is a cytoplasmic protein that regulates intracellular communication and signalling by crosslinking the protein actin to allow direct communication between the cell membrane and cytoskeletal network to control and guide proper skeletal development  disruptions in this pathway caused by flnb mutations result in the bone and cartilage abnormalities associated with boomerang dysplasia chondrocytes which also have a role in bone development are susceptible to these disruptions and either fail to undergo ossification or ossify incorrectly   flnb mutations are involved in a spectrum of lethal bone dysplasias one such disorder atelosteogenesis type i is very similar to boomerang dysplasia and several symptoms of both often overlap   early journal reports of boomerang dysplasia suggested xlinked recessive inheritance based on observation and family history  it was later discovered however that the disorder is actually caused by a sporadic genetic mutation fitting an autosomal dominant genetic profile  autosomal dominant inheritance indicates that the defective gene responsible for a disorder is located on an autosome and only one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder boomerang dysplasia although an autosomal dominant disorder  is not inherited because those afflicted do not live beyond infancy  they cannot pass the gene to the next generation ankyrin long qt syndrome 4

V cocaine also known as benzoylmethylecgonine or coke is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug  it is commonly snorted inhaled or injected into the veins mental effects may include loss of contact with reality an intense feeling of happiness or agitation physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate sweating and large pupils  high doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature  effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes  cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery  cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain after a short period of use there is a high risk that dependence will occur  its use also increases the risk of stroke myocardial infarction lung problems in those who smoke it blood infections and sudden cardiac death   cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics cornstarch quinine or sugar which can result in additional toxicity  following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired  cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine this results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain  it can easily cross the bloodbrain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier   cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant which are mostly grown in south america  in 2013 419 kilograms were produced legally  it is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion usd each year with further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine  after cannabis cocaine is the most frequently used illegal drug globally  between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year use is highest in north america followed by europe and south america between one and three percent of people in the developed world use cocaine at some point in their life  in 2013 cocaine use directly resulted in 4300 deaths up from 2400 in 1990  the leaves of the coca plant have been used by peruvians since ancient times  cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860  since 1961 the international single convention on narcotic drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a criminal offence  topical cocaine can be used as a local numbing agent to help with painful procedures in the mouth or nose  cocaine was historically useful as a topical anesthetic in eye and nasal surgery although it is now predominantly used for nasal and lacrimal duct surgery the major disadvantages of this use are cocaines intense vasoconstrictor activity and potential for cardiovascular toxicity cocaine has since been largely replaced in western medicine by synthetic local anesthetics such as benzocaine proparacaine lignocainexylocainelidocaine and tetracaine though it remains available for use if specified if vasoconstriction is desired for a procedure as it reduces bleeding the anesthetic is combined with a vasoconstrictor such as phenylephrine or epinephrine in australia it is currently  prescribed for use as a local anesthetic for conditions such as mouth and lung ulcers  some ent specialists occasionally use cocaine within the practice when performing procedures such as nasal cauterization in this scenario dissolved cocaine is soaked into a ball of cotton wool which is placed in the nostril for the 1015minutes immediately before the procedure thus performing the dual role of both numbing the area to be cauterized and vasoconstriction even when used this way some of the used cocaine may be absorbed through oral or nasal mucosa and give systemic effects  an alternative method of administration for ent surgery is mixed with adrenaline and sodium bicarbonate as moffetts solution cocaine is a powerful nervous system stimulant  its effects can last from fifteen to thirty minutes to an hour the duration of cocaines effects depends on the amount taken and the route of administration  cocaine can be in the form of fine white powder bitter to the taste when inhaled or injected it causes a numbing effect crack cocaine is a smokeable form of cocaine made into small rocks by processing cocaine with sodium bicarbonate baking soda and water  cocaine increases alertness feelings of wellbeing and euphoria energy and motor activity feelings of competence and sexuality cocaines effects are very similar to that of amphetamine however cocaines effects tend to be much shorter lasting and more prominent  many users rub the powder along the gum line or onto a cigarette filter which is then smoked which numbs the gums and teeth  hence the colloquial names of numbies gummers or cocoa puffs for this type of administration this is mostly done with the small amounts of cocaine remaining on a surface after insufflation snorting another oral method is to wrap up some cocaine in rolling paper and swallow parachute it this is sometimes called a snow bomb  coca leaves are typically mixed with an alkaline substance such as lime and chewed into a wad that is retained in the mouth between gum and cheek much in the same as chewing tobacco is chewed and sucked of its juices the juices are absorbed slowly by the mucous membrane of the inner cheek and by the gastrointestinal tract when swallowed alternatively coca leaves can be infused in liquid and consumed like tea ingesting coca leaves generally is an inefficient means of administering cocaine advocates of the consumption of the coca leaf state that coca leaf consumption should not be criminalized as it is not actual cocaine and consequently it is not properly the illicit drug  because cocaine is hydrolyzed and rendered inactive in the acidic stomach it is not readily absorbed when ingested alone only when mixed with a highly alkaline substance such as lime can it be absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach the efficiency of absorption of orally administered cocaine is limited by two additional factors first the drug is partly catabolized by the liver second capillaries in the mouth and esophagus constrict after contact with the drug reducing the surface area over which the drug can be absorbed nevertheless cocaine metabolites can be detected in the urine of subjects that have sipped even one cup of coca leaf infusion therefore this is an actual additional form of administration of cocaine albeit an inefficient one  orally administered cocaine takes approximately 30minutes to enter the bloodstream typically only a third of an oral dose is absorbed although absorption has been shown to reach 60 in controlled settings given the slow rate of absorption maximum physiological and psychotropic effects are attained approximately 60minutes after cocaine is administered by ingestion while the onset of these effects is slow the effects are sustained for approximately 60minutes after their peak is attained  contrary to popular belief both ingestion and insufflation result in approximately the same proportion of the drug being absorbed 30 to 60 compared to ingestion the faster absorption of insufflated cocaine results in quicker attainment of maximum drug effects snorting cocaine produces maximum physiological effects within 40minutes and maximum psychotropic effects within 20minutes however a more realistic activation period is closer to 5 to 10minutes which is similar to ingestion of cocaine physiological and psychotropic effects from nasally insufflated cocaine are sustained for approximately 4060minutes after the peak effects are attained  coca tea an infusion of coca leaves is also a traditional method of consumption the tea has often been recommended for travelers in the andes to prevent altitude sickness  however its actual effectiveness has never been systematically studied  this method of consumption has been practised for many centuries by the indigenous tribes of south america one specific purpose of ancient coca leaf consumption was to increase energy and reduce fatigue in messengers who made multiday quests to other settlements  in 1986 an article in the journal of the american medical association revealed that us health food stores were selling dried coca leaves to be prepared as an infusion as health inca tea  while the packaging claimed it had been decocainized no such process had actually taken place the article stated that drinking two cups of the tea per day gave a mild stimulation increased heart rate and mood elevation and the tea was essentially harmless despite this the dea seized several shipments in hawaii chicago georgia and several locations on the east coast of the united states and the product was removed from the shelves nasal insufflation known colloquially as snorting sniffing or blowing is a common method of ingestion of recreational powdered cocaine  the drug coats and is absorbed through the mucous membranes lining the sinuses when insufflating cocaine absorption through the nasal membranes is approximately 3060 with higher doses leading to increased absorption efficiency any material not directly absorbed through the mucous membranes is collected in mucus and swallowed this drip is considered pleasant by some and unpleasant by others in a study  of cocaine users the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 146minutes any damage to the inside of the nose is because cocaine highly constricts blood vessels and therefore blood and oxygennutrient flow to that area nosebleeds after cocaine insufflation are due to irritation and damage of mucus membranes by foreign particles and adulterants and not the cocaine itself  as a vasoconstrictor cocaine acts to reduce bleeding prior to insufflation cocaine powder must be divided into very fine particles cocaine of high purity breaks into fine dust very easily except when it is moist not well stored and forms chunks which reduces the efficiency of nasal absorption  rolled up banknotes hollowedout pens cut straws pointed ends of keys specialized spoons long fingernails and clean tampon applicators are often used to insufflate cocaine such devices are often called tooters by users the cocaine typically is poured onto a flat hard surface such as a mirror cd case or book and divided into bumps lines or rails and then insufflated  the amount of cocaine in a line varies widely from person to person and occasion to occasion the purity of the cocaine is also a factor but one line is generally considered to be a single dose and is typically 35mg a bump to 100mg a rail  as tolerance builds rapidly in the shortterm hours many lines are often snorted to produce greater effects  a 2001 study reported that the sharing of straws used to snort cocaine can spread blood diseases such as hepatitis c  drug injection provides the highest blood levels of drug in the shortest amount of time subjective effects not commonly shared with other methods of administration include a ringing in the ears moments after injection usually when in excess of 120milligrams lasting 2 to 5minutes including tinnitus and audio distortion this is colloquially referred to as a bell ringer in a study of cocaine users the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 31minutes  the euphoria passes quickly aside from the toxic effects of cocaine there is also danger of circulatory emboli from the insoluble substances that may be used to cut the drug as with all injected illicit substances there is a risk of the user contracting bloodborne infections if sterile injecting equipment is not available or used additionally because cocaine is a vasoconstrictor and usage often entails multiple injections within several hours or less subsequent injections are progressively more difficult to administer which in turn may lead to more injection attempts and more consequences from improperly performed injection  an injected mixture of cocaine and heroin known as speedball is a particularly dangerous combination as the converse effects of the drugs actually complement each other but may also mask the symptoms of an overdose it has been responsible for numerous deaths including celebrities such as john belushi chris farley mitch hedberg river phoenix layne staley and philip seymour hoffman experimentally cocaine injections can be delivered to animals such as fruit flies to study the mechanisms of cocaine addiction  inhalation or smoking is one of the several means cocaine is administered cocaine is smoked by inhaling the vapor by sublimating solid cocaine by heating  in a 2000 brookhaven national laboratory medical department study based on self reports of 32 abusers who participated in the studypeak high was found at mean of 14min  05minutes  smoking freebase or crack cocaine is most often accomplished using a pipe made from a small glass tube often taken from love roses small glass tubes with a paper rose that are promoted as romantic gifts  these are sometimes called stems horns blasters and straight shooters a small piece of clean heavy copper or occasionally stainless steel scouring pad often called a brillo actual brillo pads contain soap and are not used or chore named for chore boy brand copper scouring pads serves as a reduction base and flow modulator in which the rock can be melted and boiled to vapor crack smokers also sometimes smoke through a soda can with small holes in the bottom  crack is smoked by placing it at the end of the pipe a flame held close to it produces vapor which is then inhaled by the smoker the effects felt almost immediately after smoking are very intense and do not last long  usually 5 to 15 minutes  when smoked cocaine is sometimes combined with other drugs such as cannabis often rolled into a joint or blunt powdered cocaine is also sometimes smoked though heat destroys much of the chemical smokers often sprinkle it on cannabis  the language referring to paraphernalia and practices of smoking cocaine vary as do the packaging methods in the street level sale  little research has been focused on the suppository anal or vaginal insertion method of administration also known as plugging this method of administration is commonly administered using an oral syringe cocaine can be dissolved in water and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed anecdotal evidence of its effects are infrequently discussed possibly due to social taboos in many cultures the rectum and the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would be taken up through the membranes lining its walls  with excessive or prolonged use the drug can cause itching fast heart rate hallucinations and paranoid delusions  overdoses cause hyperthermia and a marked elevation of blood pressure which can be lifethreatening  arrhythmias  and death  anxiety paranoia and restlessness can also occur especially during the comedown with excessive dosage tremors convulsions and increased body temperature are observed  severe cardiac adverse events particularly sudden cardiac death become a serious risk at high doses due to cocaines blocking effect on cardiac sodium channels  chronic cocaine intake causes strong imbalances of transmitter levels in order to compensate extremes thus receptors disappear from the cell surface or reappear on it resulting more or less in an off or working mode respectively or they change their susceptibility for binding partners ligands mechanisms called downregulation and upregulation however studies suggest cocaine abusers do not show normal agerelated loss of striatal dopamine transporter dat sites suggesting cocaine has neuroprotective properties for dopamine neurons  possible side effects include insatiable hunger aches insomniaoversleeping lethargy and persistent runny nose depression with suicidal ideation may develop in very heavy users finally a loss of vesicular monoamine transporters neurofilament proteins and other morphological changes appear to indicate a long term damage of dopamine neurons all these effects contribute a rise in tolerance thus requiring a larger dosage to achieve the same effect   the lack of normal amounts of serotonin and dopamine in the brain is the cause of the dysphoria and depression felt after the initial high physical withdrawal is not dangerous physiological changes caused by cocaine withdrawal include vivid and unpleasant dreams insomnia or hypersomnia increased appetite and psychomotor retardation or agitation  physical side effects from chronic smoking of cocaine include coughing up blood bronchospasm itching fever diffuse alveolar infiltrates without effusions pulmonary and systemic eosinophilia chest pain lung trauma sore throat asthma hoarse voice dyspnea shortness of breath and an aching flulike syndrome cocaine constricts blood vessels dilates pupils and increases body temperature heart rate and blood pressure it can also cause headaches and gastrointestinal complications such as abdominal pain and nausea a common but untrue belief is that the smoking of cocaine chemically breaks down tooth enamel and causes tooth decay however cocaine does often cause involuntary tooth grinding known as bruxism which can deteriorate tooth enamel and lead to gingivitis  additionally stimulants like cocaine methamphetamine and even caffeine cause dehydration and dry mouth since saliva is an important mechanism in maintaining ones oral ph level chronic stimulant abusers who do not hydrate sufficiently may experience demineralization of their teeth due to the ph of the tooth surface dropping too low below 55 chronic intranasal usage can degrade the cartilage separating the nostrils the septum nasi leading eventually to its complete disappearance due to the absorption of the cocaine from cocaine hydrochloride the remaining hydrochloride forms a dilute hydrochloric acid  cocaine may also greatly increase this risk of developing rare autoimmune or connective tissue diseases such as lupus goodpasture syndrome vasculitis glomerulonephritis stevensjohnson syndrome and other diseases     it can also cause a wide array of kidney diseases and kidney failure   cocaine misuse doubles both the risks of hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes  as well as increases the risk of other infarctions such as myocardial infarction  cocaine addiction occurs through accumbal \u03b4fosb overexpression which arises through transcriptional regulation and epigenetic remodeling of the nucleus accumbens cocaine dependence is a form of psychological dependence that develops from regular cocaine use and produces a withdrawal state with emotionalmotivational deficits upon cessation of cocaine use the pharmacodynamics of cocaine involve the complex relationships of neurotransmitters inhibiting monoamine uptake in rats with ratios of about serotonindopamine  23 serotoninnorepinephrine  25  the most extensively studied effect of cocaine on the central nervous system is the blockade of the dopamine transporter protein dopamine transmitter released during neural signaling is normally recycled via the transporter ie the transporter binds the transmitter and pumps it out of the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic neuron where it is taken up into storage vesicles cocaine binds tightly at the dopamine transporter forming a complex that blocks the transporters function the dopamine transporter can no longer perform its reuptake function and thus dopamine accumulates in the synaptic cleft cocaines effects on serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine 5ht show across multiple serotonin receptors and is shown to inhibit the reuptake of 5ht3 specifically as an important contributor to the effects of cocaine the overabundance of 5ht3 receptors in cocaine conditioned rats display this trait however the exact effect of 5ht3 in this process is unclear  the 5ht2 receptor particularly the subtypes 5ht2ar 5ht2br and 5ht2cr show influence in the evocation of hyperactivity displayed in cocaine use  cocaine has been demonstrated to bind as to directly stabilize the dat transporter on the open outwardfacing conformation further cocaine binds in such a way as to inhibit a hydrogen bond innate to dat cocaines binding properties are such that it attaches so this hydrogen bond will not form and is blocked from formation due to the tightly locked orientation of the cocaine molecule research studies have suggested that the affinity for the transporter is not what is involved in habituation of the substance so much as the conformation and binding properties to where and how on the transporter the molecule binds  sigma receptors are affected by cocaine as cocaine functions as a sigma ligand agonist  further specific receptors it has been demonstrated to function on are nmda and the d1 dopamine receptor  cocaine also blocks sodium channels thereby interfering with the propagation of action potentials  thus like lignocaine and novocaine it acts as a local anesthetic it also functions on the binding sites to the dopamine and serotonin sodium dependent transport area as targets as separate mechanisms from its reuptake of those transporters unique to its local anesthetic value which makes it in a class of functionality different from both its own derived phenyltropanes analogues which have that removed in addition to this cocaine has some target binding to the site of the kappaopioid receptor as well  cocaine also causes vasoconstriction thus reducing bleeding during minor surgical procedures the locomotor enhancing properties of cocaine may be attributable to its enhancement of dopaminergic transmission from the substantia nigra recent research points to an important role of circadian mechanisms  and clock genes  in behavioral actions of cocaine cocaine can often cause reduced food intake many chronic users lose their appetite and can experience severe malnutrition and significant weight loss cocaine effects further are shown to be potentiated for the user when used in conjunction with new surroundings and stimuli and otherwise novel environs  cocaine is extensively metabolized primarily in the liver with only about 1 excreted unchanged in the urine the metabolism is dominated by hydrolytic ester cleavage so the eliminated metabolites consist mostly of benzoylecgonine be the major metabolite and other significant metabolites in lesser amounts such as ecgonine methyl ester eme and ecgonine further minor metabolites of cocaine include norcocaine phydroxycocaine mhydroxycocaine phydroxybenzoylecgonine pohbe and mhydroxybenzoylecgonine  if consumed with alcohol cocaine combines with alcohol in the liver to form cocaethylene studies have suggested cocaethylene is both more euphoric and has a higher cardiovascular toxicity than cocaine by itself    depending on liver and kidney function cocaine metabolites are detectable in urine benzoylecgonine can be detected in urine within four hours after cocaine intake and remains detectable in concentrations greater than 150ngml typically for up to eight days after cocaine is used detection of accumulation of cocaine metabolites in hair is possible in regular users until the sections of hair grown during use are cut or fall out cocaine in its purest form is a white pearly product cocaine appearing in powder form is a salt typically cocaine hydrochloride cas 53214 street market cocaine is frequently adulterated or cut with various powdery fillers to increase its weight the substances most commonly used in this process are baking soda sugars such as lactose dextrose inositol and mannitol and local anesthetics such as lidocaine or benzocaine which mimic or add to cocaines numbing effect on mucous membranes cocaine may also be cut with other stimulants such as methamphetamine  adulterated cocaine is often a white offwhite or pinkish powder the color of crack cocaine depends upon several factors including the origin of the cocaine used the method of preparation  with ammonia or baking soda  and the presence of impurities but will generally range from white to a yellowish cream to a light brown its texture will also depend on the adulterants origin and processing of the powdered cocaine and the method of converting the base it ranges from a crumbly texture sometimes extremely oily to a hard almost crystalline nature cocaine is a weakly alkaline compound an alkaloid and can therefore combine with acidic compounds to form various salts the hydrochloride hcl salt of cocaine is by far the most commonly encountered although the sulfate so4 and the nitrate no3 are occasionally seen different salts dissolve to a greater or lesser extent in various solvents  the hydrochloride salt is polar in character and is quite soluble in water as the name implies freebase is the base form of cocaine as opposed to the salt form it is practically insoluble in water whereas hydrochloride salt is watersoluble smoking freebase cocaine has the additional effect of releasing methylecgonidine into the users system due to the pyrolysis of the substance a side effect which insufflating or injecting powder cocaine does not create some research suggests that smoking freebase cocaine can be even more cardiotoxic than other routes of administration  because of methylecgonidines effects on lung tissue  and liver tissue  pure cocaine is prepared by neutralizing its compounding salt with an alkaline solution which will precipitate to nonpolar basic cocaine it is further refined through aqueoussolvent liquidliquid extraction crack is a lower purity form of freebase cocaine that is usually produced by neutralization of cocaine hydrochloride with a solution of baking soda sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and water producing a very hardbrittle offwhitetobrown colored amorphous material that contains sodium carbonate entrapped water and other byproducts as the main impurities the freebase and crack forms of cocaine are usually administered by vaporization of the powdered substance into smoke which is then inhaled  the origin of the name crack comes from the crackling sound and hence the onomatopoeic moniker crack that is produced when the cocaine and its impurities ie water sodium bicarbonate are heated past the point of vaporization  pure cocaine basecrack can be smoked because it vaporizes smoothly with little or no decomposition at 98c 208f  which is below the boiling point of water the smoke produced from cocaine base is usually described as having a very distinctive pleasant taste in contrast cocaine hydrochloride does not vaporize until heated to a much higher temperature about 197c and considerable decompositionburning occurs at these high temperatures this effectively destroys some of the cocaine and yields a sharp acrid and foultasting smoke smoking or vaporizing cocaine and inhaling it into the lungs produces an almost immediate high that can be very powerful and addicting quite rapidly  this initial crescendo of stimulation is known as a rush while the stimulating effects may last for hours the euphoric sensation is very brief prompting the user to smoke more immediately coca herbal infusion also referred to as coca tea is used in cocaleaf producing countries much as any herbal medicinal infusion would elsewhere in the world the free and legal commercialization of dried coca leaves under the form of filtration bags to be used as coca tea has been actively promoted by the governments of peru and bolivia for many years as a drink having medicinal powers visitors to the city of cuzco in peru and la paz in bolivia are greeted with the offering of coca leaf infusions prepared in teapots with whole coca leaves purportedly to help the newly arrived traveler overcome the malaise of high altitude sickness the effects of drinking coca tea are a mild stimulation and mood lift it does not produce any significant numbing of the mouth nor does it give a rush like snorting cocaine in order to prevent the demonization of this product its promoters publicize the unproven concept that much of the effect of the ingestion of coca leaf infusion would come from the secondary alkaloids as being not only quantitatively different from pure cocaine but also qualitatively different it has been promoted as an adjuvant for the treatment of cocaine dependence in one controversial study coca leaf infusion was usedin addition to counselingto treat 23 addicted cocapaste smokers in lima peru relapses fell from an average of four times per month before treatment with coca tea to one during the treatment the duration of abstinence increased from an average of 32days prior to treatment to 217days during treatment these results suggest that the administration of coca leaf infusion plus counseling would be an effective method for preventing relapse during treatment for cocaine addiction importantly these results also suggest strongly that the primary pharmacologically active metabolite in coca leaf infusions is actually cocaine and not the secondary alkaloids  the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine can be detected in the urine of people a few hours after drinking one cup of coca leaf infusion  the first synthesis and elucidation of the cocaine molecule was by richard willstätter in 1898  willstätters synthesis derived cocaine from tropinone since then robert robinson and edward leete have made significant contributions to the mechanism of the synthesis no3 the additional carbon atoms required for the synthesis of cocaine are derived from acetylcoa by addition of two acetylcoa units to the nmethyl\u03b4 pyrrolinium cation  the first addition is a mannichlike reaction with the enolate anion from acetylcoa acting as a nucleophile towards the pyrrolinium cation the second addition occurs through a claisen condensation this produces a racemic mixture of the 2substituted pyrrolidine with the retention of the thioester from the claisen condensation in formation of tropinone from racemic ethyl 2313c24nmethyl2pyrrolidinyl3oxobutanoate there is no preference for either stereoisomer  in the biosynthesis of cocaine however only the senantiomer can cyclize to form the tropane ring system of cocaine the stereoselectivity of this reaction was further investigated through study of prochiral methylene hydrogen discrimination  this is due to the extra chiral center at c2  this process occurs through an oxidation which regenerates the pyrrolinium cation and formation of an enolate anion and an intramolecular mannich reaction the tropane ring system undergoes hydrolysis samdependent methylation and reduction via nadph for the formation of methylecgonine the benzoyl moiety required for the formation of the cocaine diester is synthesized from phenylalanine via cinnamic acid  benzoylcoa then combines the two units to form cocaine the biosynthesis begins with lglutamine which is derived to lornithine in plants the major contribution of lornithine and larginine as a precursor to the tropane ring was confirmed by edward leete  ornithine then undergoes a pyridoxal phosphatedependent decarboxylation to form putrescine in animals however the urea cycle derives putrescine from ornithine lornithine is converted to larginine  which is then decarboxylated via plp to form agmatine hydrolysis of the imine derives ncarbamoylputrescine followed with hydrolysis of the urea to form putrescine the separate pathways of converting ornithine to putrescine in plants and animals have converged a samdependent nmethylation of putrescine gives the nmethylputrescine product which then undergoes oxidative deamination by the action of diamine oxidase to yield the aminoaldehyde schiff base formation confirms the biosynthesis of the nmethyl\u03b4 pyrrolinium cation the biosynthesis of the tropane alkaloid however is still uncertain hemscheidt proposes that robinsons acetonedicarboxylate emerges as a potential intermediate for this reaction  condensation of nmethylpyrrolinium and acetonedicarboxylate would generate the oxobutyrate decarboxylation leads to tropane alkaloid formation the reduction of tropinone is mediated by nadphdependent reductase enzymes which have been characterized in multiple plant species  these plant species all contain two types of the reductase enzymes tropinone reductase i and tropinone reductase ii tri produces tropine and trii produces pseudotropine due to differing kinetic and phactivity characteristics of the enzymes and by the 25fold higher activity of tri over trii the majority of the tropinone reduction is from tri to form tropine  cocaine and its major metabolites may be quantified in blood plasma or urine to monitor for abuse confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death most commercial cocaine immunoassay screening tests crossreact appreciably with the major cocaine metabolites but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances when interpreting the results of a test it is important to consider the cocaine usage history of the individual since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate a cocainenaive individual and the chronic user often has high baseline values of the metabolites in his system cautious interpretation of testing results may allow a distinction between passive or active usage and between smoking versus other routes of administration  in 2011 researchers at john jay college of criminal justice reported that dietary zinc supplements can mask the presence of cocaine and other drugs in urine similar claims have been made in web forums on that topic  according to a 2007 united nations report spain is the country with the highest rate of cocaine usage 30 of adults in the previous year  other countries where the usage rate meets or exceeds 15 are the united states 28 england and wales 24 canada 23 italy 21 bolivia 19 chile 18 and scotland 15  cocaine is the second most popular illegal recreational drug in europe behind cannabis since the mid1990s overall cocaine usage in europe has been on the rise but usage rates and attitudes tend to vary between countries european countries with the highest usage rates are the united kingdom spain italy and republic of ireland approximately 12 million europeans 36 have used cocaine at least once 4 million 12 in the last year and 2 million in the last month 05 about 35 million or 875 of those who have used the drug in the last year  are young adults 1534 years old usage is particularly prevalent among this demographic 4 to 7 of males have used cocaine in the last year in spain denmark republic of ireland italy and the united kingdom the ratio of male to female users is approximately 381 but this statistic varies from 11 to 131 depending on country  in 2014 london had the highest amount of cocaine in their sewage out of 50 european cities  cocaine is the second most popular illegal recreational drug in the united states behind cannabis  and the us is the worlds largest consumer of cocaine  cocaine is commonly used in middle to upper class communities and is known as a rich mans drug it is also popular amongst college students as a party drug a study throughout the entire united states has reported that around 48 percent of people who graduated high school in 1979 have used cocaine recreationally during some point in their lifetime compared to approximately 20 percent of students who graduated between the years of 1980 and 1995   its users span over different ages races and professions in the 1970s and 1980s the drug became particularly popular in the disco culture as cocaine usage was very common and popular in many discos such as studio 54 for over a thousand years south american indigenous peoples have chewed the leaves of erythroxylon coca a plant that contains vital nutrients as well as numerous alkaloids including cocaine the coca leaf was and still is chewed almost universally by some indigenous communities the remains of coca leaves have been found with ancient peruvian mummies and pottery from the time period depicts humans with bulged cheeks indicating the presence of something on which they are chewing  there is also evidence that these cultures used a mixture of coca leaves and saliva as an anesthetic for the performance of trepanation  when the spanish arrived in south america most at first ignored aboriginal claims that the leaf gave them strength and energy and declared the practice of chewing it the work of the devil  but after discovering that these claims were true they legalized and taxed the leaf taking 10 off the value of each crop  in 1569 nicolás monardes described the indigenous peoples practice of chewing a mixture of tobacco and coca leaves to induce great contentment  when they wished to make themselves drunk and out of judgment they chewed a mixture of tobacco and coca leaves which make them go as they were out of their wittes in 1609 padre blas valera wrote coca protects the body from many ailments and our doctors use it in powdered form to reduce the swelling of wounds to strengthen broken bones to expel cold from the body or prevent it from entering and to cure rotten wounds or sores that are full of maggots and if it does so much for outward ailments will not its singular virtue have even greater effect in the entrails of those who eat it  although the stimulant and hungersuppressant properties of coca had been known for many centuries the isolation of the cocaine alkaloid was not achieved until 1855 various european scientists had attempted to isolate cocaine but none had been successful for two reasons the knowledge of chemistry required was insufficient at the time  and contemporary conditions of seashipping from south america could degrade the cocaine in the plant samples available to european chemists  the cocaine alkaloid was first isolated by the german chemist friedrich gaedcke in 1855 gaedcke named the alkaloid erythroxyline and published a description in the journal archiv der pharmazie  in 1856 friedrich wöhler asked dr carl scherzer a scientist aboard the novara an austrian frigate sent by emperor franz joseph to circle the globe to bring him a large amount of coca leaves from south america in 1859 the ship finished its travels and wöhler received a trunk full of coca wöhler passed on the leaves to albert niemann a phd student at the university of göttingen in germany who then developed an improved purification process  niemann described every step he took to isolate cocaine in his dissertation titled über eine neue organische base in den cocablättern on a new organic base in the coca leaves which was published in 1860it earned him his phd and is now in the british library he wrote of the alkaloids colourless transparent prisms and said that its solutions have an alkaline reaction a bitter taste promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue niemann named the alkaloid cocaine from coca from quechua cuca  suffix ine   because of its use as a local anesthetic a suffix caine was later extracted and used to form names of synthetic local anesthetics the first synthesis and elucidation of the structure of the cocaine molecule was by richard willstätter in 1898  it was the first biomimetic synthesis of an organic structure recorded in academic chemical literature   the synthesis started from tropinone a related natural product and took five steps the name comes from coca and the alkaloid suffix ine forming cocaine with the discovery of this new alkaloid western medicine was quick to exploit the possible uses of this plant in 1879 vassili von anrep of the university of würzburg devised an experiment to demonstrate the analgesic properties of the newly discovered alkaloid he prepared two separate jars one containing a cocainesalt solution with the other containing merely salt water he then submerged a frogs legs into the two jars one leg in the treatment and one in the control solution and proceeded to stimulate the legs in several different ways the leg that had been immersed in the cocaine solution reacted very differently from the leg that had been immersed in salt water  karl koller a close associate of sigmund freud who would write about cocaine later experimented with cocaine for ophthalmic usage in an infamous experiment in 1884 he experimented upon himself by applying a cocaine solution to his own eye and then pricking it with pins his findings were presented to the heidelberg ophthalmological society also in 1884 jellinek demonstrated the effects of cocaine as a respiratory system anesthetic in 1885 william halsted demonstrated nerveblock anesthesia  and james leonard corning demonstrated peridural anesthesia  1898 saw heinrich quincke use cocaine for spinal anesthesia today cocaine has very limited medical use see the section cocaine as a local anesthetic in 1859 an italian doctor paolo mantegazza returned from peru where he had witnessed firsthand the use of coca by the local indigenous peoples he proceeded to experiment on himself and upon his return to milan he wrote a paper in which he described the effects in this paper he declared coca and cocaine at the time they were assumed to be the same as being useful medicinally in the treatment of a furred tongue in the morning flatulence and whitening of the teeth a chemist named angelo mariani who read mantegazzas paper became immediately intrigued with coca and its economic potential in 1863 mariani started marketing a wine called vin mariani which had been treated with coca leaves to become cocawine the ethanol in wine acted as a solvent and extracted the cocaine from the coca leaves altering the drinks effect it contained 6mg cocaine per ounce of wine but vin mariani which was to be exported contained 72mg per ounce to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the united states a pinch of coca leaves was included in john styth pembertons original 1886 recipe for cocacola though the company began using decocainized leaves in 1906 when the pure food and drug act was passed in 1879 cocaine began to be used to treat morphine addiction cocaine was introduced into clinical use as a local anesthetic in germany in 1884 about the same time as sigmund freud published his work über coca in which he wrote that cocaine causes  exhilaration and lasting euphoria which in no way differs from the normal euphoria of the healthy person you perceive an increase of selfcontrol and possess more vitality and capacity for work in other words you are simply normal and it is soon hard to believe you are under the influence of any drug long intensive physical work is performed without any fatigue this result is enjoyed without any of the unpleasant aftereffects that follow exhilaration brought about by alcoholic beverages no craving for the further use of cocaine appears after the first or even after repeated taking of the drug in 1885 the us manufacturer parkedavis sold cocaine in various forms including cigarettes powder and even a cocaine mixture that could be injected directly into the users veins with the included needle the company promised that its cocaine products would supply the place of food make the coward brave the silent eloquent and render the sufferer insensitive to pain by the late victorian era cocaine use had appeared as a vice in literature for example it was injected by arthur conan doyles fictional sherlock holmes generally to offset the boredom he felt when he was not working on a case in early 20thcentury memphis tennessee cocaine was sold in neighborhood drugstores on beale street costing five or ten cents for a small boxful stevedores along the mississippi river used the drug as a stimulant and white employers encouraged its use by black laborers  in 1909 ernest shackleton took forced marchbrand cocaine tablets to antarctica as did captain scott a year later on his illfated journey to the south pole  during the mid1940s amidst wwii cocaine was considered for inclusion as an ingredient of a future generation of pep pills for the german military code named dix  calls for prohibition began long before the harrison act was passed by congress in 1914  a law requiring cocaine and narcotics to be dispensed only with a doctors order  before this various factors and groups acted on primarily a state level influencing a move towards prohibition and away from a laissezfaire attitude  cocaine consumption had grown in 1903 to about five times that of 1890 predominately by nonmedical users outside the middleaged white professional class cocaine became associated with laborers youths blacks and the urban underworld  popularization of cocaine is first evident with laborers who used it as a stimulant to increase productivity  often supplied by employers  african american workers were believed by employers to be better at physical work and it was thought that it provided added strength to their constitution which according to the medical news made blacks impervious to the extremes of heat and cold  instead cocaine use quickly acquired a reputation as dangerous and in 1897 the first state bill of control for cocaine sales came from a mining county in colorado  laborers from other races used cocaine such as in northern cities where cocaine was often cheaper than alcohol  in the northeast in particular cocaine became popular amongst workers in factories textile mills and on rail roads  in some instances cocaine use supplemented or replaced caffeine as the drugofchoice to keep workers awake and working overtime  fears of coerced cocaine use and in particular that young girls would become addicted and thereby enter prostitution were widespread   tales of the corruption of the youth by cocaine were common but there is little evidence to support their veracity  mainstream media reported cocaine epidemics as early as 1894 in dallas texas reports of the cocaine epidemic would foreshadow a familiar theme in later socalled epidemics namely that cocaine presented a social threat more dangerous than simple health effects and had insidious results when used by blacks and members of the lower class similar anxietyridden reports appeared throughout cities in the south leading some to declare that the cocaine habit has assumed the proportions of an epidemic among the colored people in 1900 state legislatures in alabama georgia and tennessee considered anticocaine bills for the first time  hyperbolic reports of the effect of cocaine on african americans went handinhand with this hysteria in 1901 the atlanta constitution reported that use of the drug cocaine among negroes is growing to an alarming extent  the new york times reported that under the influence of cocaine sexual desires are increased and perverted  peaceful negroes become quarrelsome and timid negroes develop a degree of dutch courage that is sometimes almost incredible  a medical doctor even wrote cocaine is often the direct incentive to the crime of rape by the negroes  to complete the characterization a judge in mississippi declared that supplying a negro with cocaine was more dangerous than injecting a dog with rabies  these attitudes not only influenced drug law and policy but also led to increased violence against african americans in 1906 a major race riot led by whites erupted it was sparked by reports of crimes committed by black cocaine fiends  indeed whiteled race riots spawning from reports of blacks under the influence of cocaine were not uncommon  police in the south widely adopted the use of a heavier caliber handguns so as to better stop a cocainecrazed black person  believed to be empowered with superhuman strength  another dangerous myth perpetuated amongst police was that cocaine imbued african americans with tremendous accuracy with firearms and therefore police were better advised to shoot first in questionable circumstances  ultimately public opinion rested against the cocaine user criminality was commonly believed to be a natural result of cocaine use  much of the influence for these kind of perceptions came from the widespread publicity given to notorious cases  while the historical reality of cocaines effect on violence and crime is difficult to disentangle from inflamed perceptions it does appear that public opinion was swayed by the image of the violent cocainecrazed fiend and pushed over the edge by a few violent episodes  it was an image of the cocaineuser that carried acute racial overtones  before any substantive federal regulation of cocaine state and local municipalities evoked their own means to regulate cocaine because of the initial lack of targeted legislation on both federal and state level the most typical strategy by law enforcement was the application of nuisance laws pertaining to vagrancy and disturbing the peace  subsequent legislative actions aimed at controlling the distribution of cocaine rather than its manufacture  reformers took this approach in part because of legal precedents which made it easier to control distributors such as pharmacies state and local boards of health or boards of pharmacy often took the place of regulatory bodies for controlling the distribution of cocaine  some states took the position of outright banning of all forms of cocaine sale georgia was the first to do this in 1902  a new orleans ordinance banned cocaine sales as well but left an illdefined exception for therapeutic uses  a more common requirement was to restrict the sale of cocaine or impose labeling requirements a 1907 california law limiting sale of cocaine to only those with a physicians prescription resulted in the arrest of over 50 store owners and clerks in the first year  a 1913 new york state law limited druggists cocaine stocks to under 5 ounces labeling requirements initially operated on a state level with some states even going so far as to require that cocaine and cocainecontaining products be labeled as poison  eventually the federal government stepped in and instituted a national labeling requirement for cocaine and cocainecontaining products through the food and drug act of 1906  the next important federal regulation was the harrison narcotics tax act of 1914 while this act is often seen as the start of prohibition the act itself was not actually a prohibition on cocaine but instead set up a regulatory and licensing regime  the harrison act did not recognize addiction as a treatable condition and therefore the therapeutic use of cocaine heroin or morphine to such individuals was outlawed  leading the journal of american medicine to remark the addict is denied the medical care he urgently needs open aboveboard sources from which he formerly obtained his drug supply are closed to him and he is driven to the underworld where he can get his drug but of course surreptitiously and in violation of the law  the harrison act left manufacturers of cocaine untouched so long as they met certain purity and labeling standards  despite that cocaine was typically illegal to sell and legal outlets were more rare the quantities of legal cocaine produced declined very little  legal cocaine quantities did not decrease until the jonesmiller act of 1922 put serious restrictions on cocaine manufactures  in many countries cocaine is a popular recreational drug in the united states the development of crack cocaine introduced the substance to a generally poorer innercity market use of the powder form has stayed relatively constant experiencing a new height of use during the late 1990s and early 2000s in the us and has become much more popular in the last few years in the uk   cocaine use is prevalent across all socioeconomic strata including age demographics economic social political religious and livelihood  the estimated us cocaine market exceeded us70 billion in street value for the year 2005 exceeding revenues by corporations such as starbucks   there is a tremendous demand for cocaine in the us market particularly among those who are making incomes affording luxury spending such as single adults and professionals with discretionary income cocaines status as a club drug shows its immense popularity among the party crowd in 1995 the world health organization who and the united nations interregional crime and justice research institute unicri announced in a press release the publication of the results of the largest global study on cocaine use ever undertaken however a decision by an american representative in the world health assembly banned the publication of the study because it seemed to make a case for the positive uses of cocaine an excerpt of the report strongly conflicted with accepted paradigms for example that occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems in the sixth meeting of the b committee the us representative threatened that if world health organization activities relating to drugs failed to reinforce proven drug control approaches funds for the relevant programs should be curtailed this led to the decision to discontinue publication a part of the study was recuperated and published in 2010 including profiles of cocaine use in 20 countries but are unavailable as of 2015  in october 2010 it was reported that the use of cocaine in australia has doubled since monitoring began in 2003  a problem with illegal cocaine use especially in the higher volumes used to combat fatigue rather than increase euphoria by longterm users is the risk of ill effects or damage caused by the compounds used in adulteration cutting or stepping on the drug is commonplace using compounds which simulate ingestion effects such as novocain procaine producing temporary anesthaesia as many users believe a strong numbing effect is the result of strong andor pure cocaine ephedrine or similar stimulants that are to produce an increased heart rate the normal adulterants for profit are inactive sugars usually mannitol creatine or glucose so introducing active adulterants gives the illusion of purity and to stretch or make it so a dealer can sell more product than without the adulterants  the adulterant of sugars allows the dealer to sell the product for a higher price because of the illusion of purity and allows to sell more of the product at that higher price enabling dealers to significantly increase revenue with little additional cost for the adulterants a 2007 study by the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction showed that the purity levels for street purchased cocaine was often under 5 and on average under 50 pure  the production distribution and sale of cocaine products is restricted and illegal in most contexts in most countries as regulated by the single convention on narcotic drugs and the united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in the united states the manufacture importation possession and distribution of cocaine is additionally regulated by the 1970 controlled substances act some countries such as peru and bolivia permit the cultivation of coca leaf for traditional consumption by the local indigenous population but nevertheless prohibit the production sale and consumption of cocaine in addition some parts of europe and australia allow processed cocaine for medicinal uses only in 2004 according to the united nations 589 tonnes of cocaine were seized globally by law enforcement authorities colombia seized 188t the united states 166t europe 79t peru 14t bolivia 9t and the rest of the world 133 t  because of the drugs potential for addiction and overdose cocaine is generally treated as a hard drug with severe penalties for possession and trafficking demand remains high and consequently black market cocaine is quite expensive unprocessed cocaine such as coca leaves are occasionally purchased and sold but this is exceedingly rare as it is much easier and more profitable to conceal and smuggle it in powdered form the scale of the market is immense 770 tonnes times 100 per gram retail  up to 77 billion  until 2012 colombia was the worlds leading producer of cocaine   threequarters of the worlds annual yield of cocaine has been produced in colombia both from cocaine base imported from peru primarily the huallaga valley and bolivia and from locally grown coca there was a 28 increase from the amount of potentially harvestable coca plants which were grown in colombia in 1998 this combined with crop reductions in bolivia and peru made colombia the nation with the largest area of coca under cultivation after the mid1990s coca grown for traditional purposes by indigenous communities a use which is still present and is permitted by colombian laws only makes up a small fragment of total coca production most of which is used for the illegal drug trade  an interview with a coca farmer published in 2003 described a mode of production by acidbase extraction that has changed little since 1905 roughly 625 pounds 283kg of leaves were harvested per hectare six times per year the leaves were dried for half a day then chopped into small pieces with a strimmer and sprinkled with a small amount of powdered cement replacing sodium carbonate from former times several hundred pounds of this mixture were soaked in 50 us gallons 190l of gasoline for a day then the gasoline was removed and the leaves were pressed for remaining liquid after which they could be discarded then battery acid weak sulfuric acid was used one bucket per 55lb 25kg of leaves to create a phase separation in which the cocaine free base in the gasoline was acidified and extracted into a few buckets of murkylooking smelly liquid once powdered caustic soda was added to this the cocaine precipitated and could be removed by filtration through a cloth the resulting material when dried was termed pasta and sold by the farmer the 3750pound yearly harvest of leaves from a hectare produced 6lb 25kg of pasta approximately 4060 cocaine repeated recrystallization from solvents producing pasta lavada and eventually crystalline cocaine were performed at specialized laboratories after the sale  attempts to eradicate coca fields through the use of defoliants have devastated part of the farming economy in some coca growing regions of colombia and strains appear to have been developed that are more resistant or immune to their use whether these strains are natural mutations or the product of human tampering is unclear these strains have also shown to be more potent than those previously grown increasing profits for the drug cartels responsible for the exporting of cocaine although production fell temporarily coca crops rebounded in numerous smaller fields in colombia rather than the larger plantations  the cultivation of coca has become an attractive economic decision for many growers due to the combination of several factors including the lack of other employment alternatives the lower profitability of alternative crops in official crop substitution programs the eradicationrelated damages to nondrug farms the spread of new strains of the coca plant due to persistent worldwide demand  the latest estimate provided by the us authorities on the annual production of cocaine in colombia refers to 290 metric tons as of the end of 2011 the seizure operations of colombian cocaine carried out in different countries have totaled 3518 metric tons of cocaine ie 1213 of colombias annual production according to the us department of states estimates    synthetic cocaine would be highly desirable to the illegal drug industry as it would eliminate the high visibility and low reliability of offshore sources and international smuggling replacing them with clandestine domestic laboratories as are common for illicit methamphetamine however natural cocaine remains the lowest cost and highest quality supply of cocaine actual full synthesis of cocaine is rarely done formation of inactive enantiomers cocaine has 4 chiral centres  1r 2r 3s and 5s  hence a total potential of 16 possible enantiomers and diastereoisomers plus synthetic byproducts limits the yield and purity  names like synthetic cocaine and new cocaine have been misapplied to phencyclidine pcp and various designer drugs  organized criminal gangs operating on a large scale dominate the cocaine trade most cocaine is grown and processed in south america particularly in colombia bolivia peru and smuggled into the united states and europe the united states being the worlds largest consumer of cocaine  where it is sold at huge markups usually in the us at 80120 for 1gram and 250300 for 35grams \u215b of an ounce or an eight ball  as of 2005  cocaine shipments from south america transported through mexico or central america were generally moved over land or by air to staging sites in northern mexico the cocaine is then broken down into smaller loads for smuggling across the usmexico border the primary cocaine importation points in the united states have been in arizona southern california southern florida and texas typically land vehicles are driven across the usmexico border sixty five percent of cocaine enters the united states through mexico and the vast majority of the rest enters through florida   cocaine traffickers from colombia and mexico have established a labyrinth of smuggling routes throughout the caribbean the bahama island chain and south florida they often hire traffickers from mexico or the dominican republic to transport the drug using a variety of smuggling techniques to us markets these include airdrops of 500 to 700kg 1102 to 1543lb in the bahama islands or off the coast of puerto rico midocean boattoboat transfers of 500 to 2000kg 1102 to 4409lb and the commercial shipment of tonnes of cocaine through the port of miami  another route of cocaine traffic goes through chile which is primarily used for cocaine produced in bolivia since the nearest seaports lie in northern chile the arid boliviachile border is easily crossed by 4x4 vehicles that then head to the seaports of iquique and antofagasta while the price of cocaine is higher in chile than in peru and bolivia the final destination is usually europe especially spain where drug dealing networks exist among south american immigrants  cocaine is also carried in small concealed kilogram quantities across the border by couriers known as mules or mulas who cross a border either legally for example through a port or airport or illegally elsewhere the drugs may be strapped to the waist or legs or hidden in bags or hidden in the body if the mule gets through without being caught the gangs will reap most of the profits if he or she is caught however gangs will sever all links and the mule will usually stand trial for trafficking alone  bulk cargo ships are also used to smuggle cocaine to staging sites in the western caribbeangulf of mexico area these vessels are typically 150250foot 5080m coastal freighters that carry an average cocaine load of approximately 25 tonnes commercial fishing vessels are also used for smuggling operations in areas with a high volume of recreational traffic smugglers use the same types of vessels such as gofast boats as those used by the local populations  sophisticated drug subs are the latest tool drug runners are using to bring cocaine north from colombia it was reported on 20 march 2008 although the vessels were once viewed as a quirky sideshow in the drug war they are becoming faster more seaworthy and capable of carrying bigger loads of drugs than earlier models according to those charged with catching them  cocaine is readily available in all major countries metropolitan areas according to the summer 1998 pulse check published by the us office of national drug control policy cocaine use had stabilized across the country with a few increases reported in san diego bridgeport miami and boston in the west cocaine usage was lower which was thought to be due to a switch to methamphetamine among some users methamphetamine is cheaper three and a half times more powerful and lasts 1224times longer with each dose   nevertheless the number of cocaine users remain high with a large concentration among urban youth in addition to the amounts previously mentioned cocaine can be sold in bill sizes as of 2007 for example 10 might purchase a dime bag a very small amount 01015g of cocaine twenty dollars might purchase 01503g however in lower texas it is sold cheaper due to it being easier to receive a dime for 10 is 04g a 20 is 0810gram and an 8ball 35g is sold for 60 to 80 depending on the quality and dealer  these amounts and prices are very popular among young people because they are inexpensive and easily concealed on ones body quality and price can vary dramatically depending on supply and demand and on geographic region  in 2008 the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction reports that the typical retail price of cocaine varied between 50 and 75 per gram in most european countries although cyprus romania sweden and turkey reported much higher values  world annual cocaine consumption as of 2000 stood at around 600 tonnes with the united states consuming around 300 t 50 of the total europe about 150 t 25 of the total and the rest of the world the remaining 150 t or 25  the 2010 un world drug report concluded that it appears that the north american cocaine market has declined in value from us47 billion in 1998 to us38 billion in 2008 between 2006 and 2008 the value of the market remained basically stable  in 2005 researchers proposed the use of cocaine in conjunction with phenylephrine administered in the form of an eye drop as a diagnostic test for parkinsons disease

V hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes is a common occurrence many of these multianomaly disorders involve structural malformations of the outer or middle ear making a significant hearing loss highly likely   individuals with treacher collins syndrome often have both cleft palate and hearing loss in addition to other disabilities hearing loss is often secondary to absent small or unusually formed ears microtia and commonly results from malformations of the middle ear researchers have found that most patients with treacher collins syndrome have symmetric external ear canal abnormalities and symmetrically dysmorphic or absent ossicles in the middle ear space inner ear structure is largely normal most patients show a moderate hearing impairment or greater and the type of loss is generally a conductive hearing loss patients with treacher collins syndrome exhibit hearing losses similar to those of patients with malformed or missing ossicles pron et al 1993 persons with pierre robin sequence prs are at greater risk for hearing impairment than persons with cleft lip andor palate without prs one study showed an average of 83 hearing loss in prs compared to 60 in cleft

effusion is generally apparent with no middle ear or inner ear malformations accordingly management by ear tubes myringotomy tubes is often effective and may restore normal levels of hearing handzic et al 1995 the hearing loss most typical in patients with stickler syndrome is a sensorineural hearing loss indicating that the source of the deficit lies in the inner ear the vestibulocochlear nerve or the processing centers of the brain szymkobennett et al 2001 found that the overall hearing loss in type i stickler syndrome is generally mild and is not significantly progressive hearing loss is more common in the higher frequencies from about 40008000hz szymkobennett et al 2001 this mildly progressive sensorineural loss or more significant losses associated with types ii and iii stickler syndrome is present in about 80 of patients with stickler syndrome however other patients are also susceptible to conductive losses similar to nonsyndromic cleft patients petersonfalzone et al 2001

population due to almost constant middle ear disease gould et al 1982 patients with crouzon syndrome sometimes exhibit malformations of the external ear andor the middle ear such as malalignment of the pinna petersonfalzone et al 2001 literature has suggested that persons with crouzon syndrome typically have conductive hearing loss caused by middle ear effusion or fluid in the middle ear and perforation to ossicular fixation ossicles intratympanic bony masses tympanic membrane ossicular anomalies and closure of the oval window patients with a sensorineural hearing loss have also been reported but are less likely to occur a conductive hearing loss along with middle ear disease is most commonly seen in patients with pfeiffer syndrome although there have been reports of mixed hearing loss as well the hearing loss is most typically caused by stenosis or atresia of the auditory canal middle ear hypoplasia and ossicular hypoplasia vallinonapoli 1996 conductive hearing loss has been reported by many with ectrodactylyectodermal dysplasiacleft eec syndrome in association with a cleft palate pertersonfalzone 2001 in saethrechotzen syndrome the ears may be low set posteriorly rotated have other minor anomalies and there may be a presence of a conductive hearing loss or a mixed hearing loss pertersonfalszone 2001 hearing loss in this group can also be caused by middle ear disease when a cleft palate is present httpwwwworldcforgchotzencfm about 70 of individuals with velocardiofacial syndrome vcfs have minor auricular malformations or malformations of the ear in this syndrome the ears are typically lowset and somewhat posteriorly rotated in addition to external malformations individuals with vcfs are more vulnerable to otitis media because of the presence of a cleft or other form of velopharyngeal inadequacy the hearing loss associated with vcfs is conductive when otitis media is present petersonfalzone et al 2001 there are also sporadic reports of sensorineural hearing loss and a mixed hearing loss of individuals with vcfs who have a hearing loss only 11 had a sensorineural loss and 5 a mixed loss reyes et al 1999 individuals with hemifacial microsomia also called oculoauriculovertebral spectrum often have ear malformations these malformations can be in the form of preauricular ear pits complete absence of the auricle stenosis or atresia of the external auditory canal ossicular malformations middle ear deformities and incomplete pneumatization of the temporal bone rahbar et al 2001 found that 95 of individuals with this syndrome have an ear malformation of some type in addition to ear malformations a conductive hearing loss can be present typically ranging from mild to severe there are also reported cases of cochlear involvement and sensorineural hearing loss rahbar et al 2001 found that 86 of patients with hemifacial microsomia have a conductive hearing loss and 10 have a sensorineural hearing loss there is no correlation between the severity of dysmorphic features and the degree of hearing loss meaning individuals with mild malformations can have severely impaired hearing individuals with nager syndrome typically have the malformations of the auricle external auditory canal and middle ear including the ossicles these malformations were found in 80 of individuals with nager syndrome inner ear malformations however are not typically seen in this population middle ear disease is common among individuals with nager syndrome chronic otitis media and eustachian tube deformity can result in conductive hearing loss for this reason early detection and treatment for middle ear disease is crucial in this population sensorineural hearing loss is not a typical characteristic of nager syndrome however a subset of individuals present with a mixed hearing loss due to a progressive sensorineural component combined with the typical conductive hearing loss herrman et al 2005

V amniotic band constriction also known as amniotic band syndrome adam complex amniotic band sequence congenital constriction bands and pseudoainhum  is a congenital disorder caused by entrapment of fetal parts usually a limb or digits in fibrous amniotic bands while in utero   the constriction of appendages by amniotic bands may result in a strong relationship between abs and clubfoot also called talipes exists a 315 of associated clubfoot deformity and abs can be correlated with 20 occurring bilaterally other abnormalities found with abs include clubhands cleft lip andor cleft palate and hemangioma decreased fetal movement could be a sign of a serious problem which may include abs it is rare but possible for the membrane to become wrapped around the placenta or the neck of the baby in the womb causing strangulation and death to explain the cause of abs there are two main theories the amniotic band theory is that abs occurs due to a partial rupture of the amniotic sac this rupture involves only the amnion the chorion remains intact fibrous bands of the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can encircle and trap some part of the fetus later as the fetus grows but the bands do not the bands become constricting this constriction reduces blood circulation hence causes congenital abnormalities in some cases a complete natural amputation of a digits or limb may occur before birth or the digits or limbs may be necrotic dead and require surgical amputation following birth the vascular disruption theory because the constricting mechanism of the amniotic band theory does not explain the high incidence of cleft palate and other forms of cleft defects occurring together with abs this cooccurrence suggests an intrinsic defect of the blood circulation amniotic band syndrome is often difficult to detect before birth as the individual strands are small and hard to see on ultrasound often the bands are detected indirectly because of the constrictions and swelling upon limbs digits etc misdiagnosis is also common so if there are any signs of amniotic bands further detailed ultrasound tests should be done to assess the severity 3d ultrasound and mri can be used for more detailed and accurate diagnosis of bands and the resulting damagedanger to the fetus in rare cases if diagnosed in utero fetal surgery may be considered to save a limb which is in danger of amputation or other deformity this typically would not be attempted if neither vital organs nor the umbilical cord were affected this operation has been successfully performed on fetuses as young as 22 weeks  the surgery took place at melbournes monash medical centre in australia and is believed to be the earliest surgery of its type as surgeons usually hold off on operating until the woman is in week 28 of gestation  there are also several facilities in the united states that have performed successful amniotic band release surgery treatment usually occurs after birth and where plastic and reconstructive surgery is considered to treat the resulting deformity  plastic surgery ranges from simple to complex depending on the extent of the deformity physical and occupational therapy may be needed long term prosthetics may help some abs sufferers to live more functional lives the price and complexity of these prosthetics vary dramatically but advances in 3d printing have helped to increase the availability of artificial fingers while reducing their cost of production  the prognosis depends on the location and severity of the constricting bands every case is different and multiple bands may be entangled around the fetus bands which wrap around fingers and toes can result in syndactyly or amputations of the digits in other instances bands can wrap around limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet in more severe cases the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation amniotic bands can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate if the bands become wrapped around the head or umbilical cord it can be lifethreatening for the fetus the number of cases of miscarriage that can be attributed to abs is unknown although it has been reported that it may be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages amniotic band syndrome is considered an accidental event and it does not appear to be genetic or hereditary so the likelihood of it occurring in another pregnancy is remote the cause of amnion tearing is unknown and as such there are no known preventative measures amniotic banding affects approximately 1 in 1200 live births it is also believed to be the cause of 178 in 10000 miscarriages up to 50 of cases have other congenital anomalies including cleft lip cleft palate and clubfoot deformity hand and finger anomalies occur in up to 80 among the more notable people living with abs are

V brugada syndrome brs is a genetic disease that is characterised by abnormal electrocardiogram ecg findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death it is named by the spanish cardiologists pedro brugada and josep brugada it is the major   cause of sudden unexplained death syndrome suds also known as sudden adult death syndrome sads and is the most common cause of sudden death in young men without known underlying cardiac disease in thailand and laos  although the ecg findings of brugada syndrome were first reported  among survivors of cardiac arrest in 1989 it was only in 1992 that the brugada brothers  recognized it as a distinct clinical entity causing sudden death by causing ventricular fibrillation a potentially lethal arrhythmia in the heart   approximately 20 of the cases of brugada syndrome have been shown to be associated with mutations in a gene that encodes for a sodium ion channel in the cell membranes of the muscle cells of the heart the myocytes this is often referred to as a sodium channelopathy the majority of patients affected by brugada syndrome are not found to have known genetic mutations to explain the disease as of 2015  the gene named scn5a is located on the short arm of the third chromosome 3p21 lossoffunction mutations in this gene lead to a loss of the action potential dome of some epicardial areas of the right ventricle this results in transmural and epicardial dispersion of repolarization the transmural dispersion underlies stsegment elevation and the development of a vulnerable window across the ventricular wall whereas the epicardial dispersion of repolarization facilitates the development of phase 2 reentry which generates a phase 2 reentrant extrasystole that captures the vulnerable window to precipitate ventricular tachycardia andor ventricular fibrillation that often results in sudden cardiac death at present time however all the reported patients who died because of the disease and were submitted to detailed autopsy study have shown a structural right ventricular pathology underlying the syndrome over 160 mutations in the scn5a gene have been discovered to date each having varying mechanisms and effects on function thereby explaining the varying degrees of likelihood of the genetic mutation leading to the disease  that is to say penetrance and expression of this disorder  an example of one of the mechanisms in which a loss of function of the sodium channel occurs is a mutation in the gene that disrupts the sodium channels ability to bind properly to ankyring an important protein mediating interaction between ion channels and cytoskeletal elements very recently a mutation in a second gene glycerol3phosphate dehydrogenase 1like gene gpd1l has been shown to result in brugada syndrome in a large multigenerational family london 2006 this gene acts as an ion channel modulator in the heart although the exact mechanism is not yet understood recently antzelevitch has identified mutations in the ltype calcium channel subunits cacna1c a39v and g490r and cacnb2 s481l leading to st elevation and a relatively short qt interval below 360ms  for a comprehensive list of all mutations see   in 2013 bezzina et al showed that common variants at scn5ascn10a and hey2 are associated with brugada syndrome  this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and manifests itself more commonly in males due to a higher penetrance in addition it has a higher prevalence in most asian populations the prevalence of brugada ecg is indeed higher in asia than in the united states and europe specifically brugada type 1 ecg appears more frequently in asia 0036 of the population and europe 0025 than in the united states 003 type 2 and type 3 ecg is more prevalent in asia 012223 than in europe 0006 or the united states 002  genetic testing for brugada syndrome is clinically available and may help confirm a diagnosis as well as differentiate between relatives who are at risk for the disease and those who are not some symptoms when pinpointing this disease include fainting irregular heartbeats and chaotic heartbeats however just detecting the irregular heartbeat may be a sign of another disease so the doctor must detect another symptom as well   in some cases the disease can be detected by observing characteristic patterns on an electrocardiogram which may be present all the time or might be elicited by the administration of particular drugs eg class ia ajmaline procainamide or class 1c flecainide pilsicainide antiarrhythmic drugs that block sodium channels and cause appearance of ecg abnormalities or resurface spontaneously due to as yet unclarified triggers brugada syndrome has three different ecg patterns  the pattern seen on the ecg is persistent st elevations in the electrocardiographic leads v1v3 with a right bundle branch block rbbb appearance with or without the terminal s waves in the lateral leads that are associated with a typical rbbb a prolongation of the pr interval a conduction disturbance in the heart is also frequently seen the ecg can fluctuate over time depending on the autonomic balance and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs adrenergic stimulation decreases the st segment elevation while vagal stimulation worsens it there is a case report of a patient who died while shaving presumed due to the vagal stimulation of the carotid sinus massage the administration of class ia ic and iii drugs increases the st segment elevation as does fever  exercise decreases st segment elevation in some patients but increases it in others after exercise when the body temperature has risen the changes in heart rate induced by atrial pacing are accompanied by changes in the degree of st segment elevation when the heart rate decreases the st segment elevation increases and when the heart rate increases the st segment elevation decreases however the contrary can also be observed the cause of sudden death in brugada syndrome is ventricular fibrillation vf the average age of death is 41 according to clinical reports sudden death in people with brugada syndrome most often happens during sleepthe episodes of syncope fainting and sudden death aborted or not are caused by fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardias or ventricular fibrillation these arrhythmias appear with no warning while there is no exact treatment modality that reliably and totally prevents ventricular fibrillation from occurring in this syndrome treatment lies in termination of this lethal arrhythmia before it causes death this is done via insertion of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator icd which continuously monitors the heart rhythm and will shock the wearer if ventricular fibrillation is sensed recent studies have evaluated the role of quinidine a class ia antiarrhythmic drug for decreasing vf episodes occurring in this syndrome quinidine has been found to both decrease the number of vf episodes and correct spontaneous ecg changes possibly via inhibiting ito channels  some drugs have been reported to induce the type1 ecg andor fatal arrhythmias in brugada syndrome patients patients with brugada syndrome can prevent arrhythmias by avoiding these drugs or using them only in controlled conditions  those with risk factors for coronary artery disease may require an angiogram before icd implantation

V congenital lactic acidosis cla is a rare disease caused by mutations in mitochondrial dna mtdna that affect the ability of cells to use energy and cause too much lactic acid to build up in the body a condition called lactic acidosis   severe cases of cla manifest in the neonatal period milder cases caused by mtdna mutations may not manifest until as late as early adulthood symptoms may be constant or brought on by an event causing stress such as an asthma attack seizure or infection symptoms in the neonatal period include hypotonia lethargy vomiting and tachypnea as the disease progresses it causes developmental delay cognitive disabilities abnormal development of the face and head and organ failure  though lactic acidosis can be a complication of other congenital diseases when it occurs in isolation it is typically caused by a mutation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex genes it has either an autosomal recessive or xlinked mode of inheritance congenital lactic acidosis can be caused by mutations on the x chromosome or in mitochondrial dna  congenital lactic acidosis can be suspected based on blood or cerebrospinal fluid tests showing high levels of lactate the underlying genetic mutation can only be diagnosed with genetic testing  there is no proven treatment for congenital lactic acidosis treatments that are occasionally used or that are under investigation include the ketogenic diet and dichloroacetate other treatments aim to relieve symptoms  for example anticonvulsants may be used to relieve seizures
