V a coronary stent is a tubeshaped device placed in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart to keep the arteries open in the treatment of coronary heart disease it is used in a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention pci stents reduce chest pain and have been shown to improve survivability in the event of an acute myocardial infarction  similar stents and procedures are used in noncoronary vessels eg in the legs in peripheral artery disease   treating a blocked stenosed coronary artery with a stent follows the same steps as other angioplasty procedures with a few important differences the interventional cardiologist uses angiography to assess the location and estimate the size of the blockage lesion by injecting a contrast medium through the guide catheter and viewing the flow of blood through the downstream coronary arteries intravascular ultrasound ivus may be used to assess the lesions thickness and hardness calcification the cardiologist uses this information to decide whether to treat the lesion with a stent and if so what kind and size drug eluting stents are most often sold as a unit with the stent in its collapsed form attached onto the outside of a balloon catheter outside the us physicians may perform direct stenting where the stent is threaded through the lesion and expanded common practice in the us is to predilate the blockage before delivering the stent predilation is accomplished by threading the lesion with an ordinary balloon catheter and expanding it to the vessels original diameter the physician withdraws this catheter and threads the stent on its balloon catheter through the lesion the physician expands the balloon which deforms the metal stent to its expanded size the cardiologist may customize the fit of the stent to match the blood vessels shape using ivus to guide the work  it is critically important that the framework of the stent be in direct contact with the walls of the vessel to minimize potential complications such as blood clot formation very long lesions may require more than one stentthis result of this treatment is sometimes referred to as a full metal jacket  the procedure itself is performed in a catheterization clinic cath lab barring complications patients undergoing catheterizations are kept at least overnight for observation  dealing with lesions near branches in the coronary arteries presents additional challenges and requires additional techniques  coronary artery stents typically a metal framework can be placed inside the artery to help keep it open however as the stent is a foreign object not native to the body it incites an immune response this may cause scar tissue cell proliferation to rapidly grow over the stent in addition there is a strong tendency for clots to form at the site where the stent damages the arterial wall since platelets are involved in the clotting process patients must take dual antiplatelet therapy afterwards usually clopidogrel or brilinta and aspirin for one year and aspirin indefinitely  in order to reduce the treatment a new generation of stent has been developed with biodegradable polymer  however the dual antiplatelet therapy may be insufficient to fully prevent clots that may result in stent thrombosis these and the cell proliferation may cause the standard baremetal stents to become blocked restenosis drugeluting stents were designed to lessen this problem by releasing an antiproliferative drug drugs typically used against cancer or as immunosuppressants they can help avoid this instent restenosis renarrowing one of the drawbacks of vascular stents is the potential for restenosis via the development of a thick smooth muscle tissue inside the lumen the socalled neointima development of a neointima is variable but can at times be so severe as to reocclude the vessel lumen restenosis especially in the case of smaller diameter vessels which often results in reintervention consequently current research focuses on the reduction of neointima after stent placement substantial improvements have been made including the use of more biocompatible materials antiinflammatory drugeluting stents resorbable stents and others restenosis can be treated with a reintervention using the same method on september 4 2007 an international study showed that some heart attack patients would be better off not using drugcoated stents in emergency to open their clogged arteries patients were five times as likely to die after two years as those who received baremetal stents dr valentin fuster director of the cardiovascular institute at mount sinai school of medicine in new york said stents are less commonly used in europe implanted in only about 15 percent of patients there while druglined stents are used in up to 30 percent of americans having heart attacks the new research was presented by dr gabriel steg of the hospital bichatclaude bernard in paris at a meeting of the european society of cardiology in vienna dr eckhart fleck director of cardiology at the german heart institute in berlin and a spokesman for the european society of cardiology said drugeluting stents are not for everyone  the value of stenting in rescuing someone having a heart attack by immediately alleviating an obstruction is clearly defined in multiple studies but studies have failed to find reduction in hard endpoints for stents vs medical therapy in stable angina patients see below the arteryopening stent can temporarily alleviate chest pain but does not contribute to longevity the vast majority of heart attacks do not originate with obstructions that narrow arteries  a more permanent and successful way to prevent heart attacks in patients at high risk is to give up smoking to exercise regularly and take drugs to get blood pressure under control drive cholesterol levels down and prevent blood clotting  some cardiologists believe that stents are overused however in certain patient groups such as the elderly grace and other studies have found evidence of underuse one cardiologist was convicted of billing patients for performing medically unnecessary stenting   guidelines recommend a stress test before implanting stents but most patients do not receive a stress test  while revascularisation by stenting or bypass surgery is of clear benefit in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute symptoms acute coronary syndromes including myocardial infarction their benefit is less marked in stable patients clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that coronary stents improve survival over best medical treatment several other clinical trials have been performed to examine the efficacy of coronary stenting and compare with other treatment options a consensus of the medical community does not exist the first type developed by john robert dugan of shelbyville in were baremetal stents more recent are drugeluting stents in development are stents with biocompatible surface coatings which do not elute drugs and also absorbable stents metal or polymer

V the thomas stretcher is a british mountain rescue stretcher designed by in the 1930s by a climbing club committee formed to investigate the construction of a stretcher specifically for carrying injured climbers over rough ground   a stretcher committee was formed by the rucksack club after a prominent member had severe fall whilst rock climbing the member was badly injured and had to be transported from the climb on a makeshift stretcher formed from a farm gate in much discomfort  with his leg being later amputated in hospital the joint stretcher committee was formed in 1933  when the rucksack club stretcher committee merged with the similar venture of the fell  rock climbing club their requirements  were by easter 1934  the committee had the preliminary design of a stretcher later to become known as the thomas stretcher after one of the committee members eustace thomas as well as recommendations of first aid and survival equipment to accompany it the equipment could be packed into two rucksacks the basic design of the stretcher was an lightweight aluminium frame supporting a canvas bed extendible handles at each corner folded so that the stretcher to be used on narrow paths and wooden skis kept the casualty clear of the ground and allowed sledging on mud or snow the thomas stretcher was one of the most widely used  mountain rescue stretcher in the uk until the early 1970s when it was superseded by the bell stretcher modified thomas stretchers are still in regular use by at least one english mountain rescue team

V an oxygen concentrator is a device which concentrates the oxygen from a gas supply typically ambient air to supply an oxygen enriched gas stream   union carbide corporation ucc invented home medical oxygen concentrators in the late 1970s home medical oxygen concentrators began to be made in large numbers in the early 1980s prior to that time home medical oxygen therapy required the use of high pressure oxygen cylinders or small liquid cryogenic oxygen systems medicare switched from feeforservice payment to a flat monthly rate for home oxygen therapy in the mid1980s causing the durable medical equipment dme industry to quickly embrace concentrators as a way to control costs this reimbursement change dramatically decreased the number of home liquid medical oxygen systems in the us at that time the number of manufacturers entering the oxygen concentrator market increased exponentially as a result of this change ucc invented molecular sieve that made these devices possible in the 1950s ucc also invented the first home medical liquid oxygen systems in the 1960s oxygen concentrators typically use pressure swing adsorption technology and are used very widely for oxygen provision in healthcare applications especially where liquid or pressureised oxygen is too dangerous or inconvenient such as in homes or in portable clinics oxygen concentrators are also used to provide an economical source of oxygen in industrial processes where they are also known as oxygen gas generators or oxygen generation plants oxygen concentrators utilize a molecular sieve to adsorb gasses and operate on the principle of rapid pressure swing adsorption of atmospheric nitrogen onto zeolite minerals and then venting the nitrogen this type of adsorption system is therefore functionally a nitrogen scrubber leaving the other atmospheric gasses to pass through this leaves oxygen as the primary gas remaining psa technology is a reliable and economical technique for small to midscale oxygen generation with cryogenic separation more suitable at higher volumes and external delivery generally more suitable for small volumes  at high pressure the porous zeolite adsorbs large quantities of nitrogen due to its large surface area and chemical character after the oxygen and other free components are collected the pressure drops which allows nitrogen to desorb an oxygen concentrator has an air compressor two cylinders filled with zeolite pellets a pressure equalizing reservoir and some valves and tubes in the first halfcycle the first cylinder receives air from the compressor which lasts about 3 seconds during that time the pressure in the first cylinder rises from atmospheric to about 15 times normal atmospheric pressure typically 20 psi138 kpa gauge or 136 atmospheres absolute and the zeolite becomes saturated with nitrogen as the first cylinder reaches near pure oxygen there are small amounts of argon co2 water vapour radon and other minor atmospheric components in the first halfcycle a valve opens and the oxygen enriched gas flows to the pressure equalizing reservoir which connects to the patients oxygen hose at the end of the first half of the cycle there is another valve position change so that the air from the compressor is directed to the 2nd cylinder pressure in the first cylinder drops as the enriched oxygen moves into the reservoir allowing the nitrogen to be desorbed back into gas part way through the second half of the cycle there is another valve position change to vent the gas in the first cylinder back into the ambient atmosphere keeping the concentration of oxygen in the pressure equalizing reservoir from falling below about 90 the pressure in the hose delivering oxygen from the equalizing reservoir is kept steady by a pressure reducing valve older units cycled with a period of about 20 seconds and supplied up to 5 litres per minute of 90 oxygen since about 1999 units capable of supplying up to 10 lpm have been available psa generators provide a costefficient source of oxygen they are a safer  less expensive  and more convenient alternative to tanks of cryogenic oxygen or pressurised cylinders they can be used in various industries including medical pharmaceutical production water treatment and glass manufacture psa generators are particularly useful in remote or inaccessible parts of the world or mobile medical facilities military hospitals disaster facilities   since the early 2000s a number of companies have produced portable oxygen concentrators  typically these devices produce one to five liters per minute of oxygen and they use some version of pulse flow or demand flow to deliver oxygen only when the patient is inhaling they can also provide pulses of oxygen either to provide higher intermittent flows or to reduce the power consumption research into oxygen concentration is ongoing and modern techniques suggest that the amount of adsorbent required by a medical oxygen concentrators can be potentially reduced by a factor of three while offering 1020 higher oxygen recovery compared to a typical commercial unit  these portable concentrators typically plug into an electrical outlet and may have an internal battery or external battery pack for operation away from home portable oxygen concentrators usually can be plugged into the dc outlet of a vehicle and most of these devices are suitable for ambulatory use the united states federal aviation administration faa has approved the use of portable oxygen concentrators on commercial airlines  however users of these devices should check in advance as to whether a particular brand or model is permitted on a particular airline  unlike in commercial airlines users of aircraft without cabin pressurization need oxygen concentrators which are able to deliver enough flowrate even at high altitudes such as oxyfly  usually demand or pulseflow oxygen concentrators are not used by patients while they sleep there have been problems with the oxygen concentrators not being able to detect when the sleeping patient is inhaling some larger portable oxygen concentrators are designed to operate in continuousflow mode in addition to pulseflow mode continuousflow mode is considered safe for night use when coupled with a cpap machine common models retail at around 2500  leasing arrangements may be available through various medicalsupply companies andor insurance agencies military aircraft sometimes use oxygen concentrators to supply the aircrew with oxygen at high altitudes otherwise supplies of compressed oxygen are used repurposed medical oxygen concentrators or specialized industrial oxygen concentrators can be made to operate small oxyacetylene or other fuel gas cutting welding and lampworking torches  in both clinical and emergencycare situations oxygen concentrators have the advantage of not being as dangerous as oxygen cylinders which can if ruptured or leaking greatly increase the combustion rate of a fire as such oxygen concentrators are particularly advantageous in military or disaster situations where oxygen tanks may be dangerous or unfeasible oxygen concentrators are considered sufficiently foolproof to be supplied to individual patients as a prescription item for use in their homes typically they are used as an adjunct to cpap treatment of severe sleep apnea there also are other medical uses for oxygen concentrators including emphysema and other respiratory diseases temperamental units are worthless to the medical community since an individuals health frequently relies on the constant extended operation of the unit however such units are valuable to metal and glasswork hobbyists because oxygen is a permanent gas cannot be liquefied at any reasonable pressure at room temperature it is expensive to obtain in bottled form industrial processes may use much higher pressures and flows than medical units to meet that need another process called vacuum swing adsorption vsa has been developed by air products this process uses a single low pressure blower and a valve that reverses the flow through the blower so that the regeneration phase occurs under a vacuum generators using this process are being marketed to the aquaculture industry industrial oxygen concentrators are often available in a much wider range of capacities than medical concentrators industrial oxygen concentrators are sometimes referred to as oxygen generators within the oxygen and ozone industries to distinguish them from medical oxygen concentrators the distinction is used in an attempt to clarify that industrial oxygen concentrators are not medical devices approved by the food and drug administration fda and they are not suitable for use as bedside medical concentrators however applying the oxygen generator nomenclature can lead to confusion the term oxygen generator is a misnomer in that the oxygen is not generated as it is with a chemical oxygen generator but rather it is concentrated from the air the use of the oxygen generator terminology can also be a problem in shipping in the wake of the crash of valujet flight 592  which crashed due to a fire caused by chemical oxygen generators  nonmedical oxygen concentrators can be used as a feed gas to a medical oxygen system such as the oxygen system in a hospital though governmental approval is required such as by the fda and additional filtering is generally required

V medical therapy bedsrecliner chairsportable therapeutic health devicesportable cycloid therapy hand unitadjustable sleep system bedsportable thermocyclopad unit niagara therapy is an international group of independent companies manufacturing distributing and promoting various forms of cycloid vibration therapy cvt devices niagara therapy products are based upon cvt technology incorporating elements of heat and massage therapy niagaras range of medical device products includes medical therapy adjustable beds therapy reclining chairs and portable therapeutic health devices   niagara therapy was founded in north america in 1949 when the patent to the technology was purchased niagara and more specifically cycloidal vibration therapy was then introduced to australia in 1969  niagara therapy products are based upon cycloidal vibration therapy  a treatment therapy that uses 3dimensional vibration and massage to assist users with varying conditions niagara therapy medical devices are listed on the australian register of therapeutic goods artg     in order to maintain the artg listings the tga completes regular surveillance audits at niagara therapy cycloidal vibration therapy originated in the canadian coalfields in the 1920s used to separate lumps of coal a mine supervisor found that when he leant against the separator machine it relieved the symptoms of his sore joints and aching back after the mine supervisors coalfield discovery the wettlaufer brothers who were inventors mimicked the action and bought the patent in 1931 today the action of the coal separator forms the basis of cvt technology in 1946 the father of niagara therapy owen k murphy was introduced to the wettlaufer brothers and their invention at an auction having served in the war owen k murphy knew how a lack of circulation could save damaged limbs and because the auctioneer said that he believed the device could improve blood flow murphy decided to bid for the device and try it in 1949 after seeing and purportedly experiencing the benefits of cvt firsthand owen k murphy bought the patent off the wettlaufer brothers this purchase was the beginnings of what would later become niagara therapy the patent for the therapy device was purchased for 150000 which was a significant amount in the forties by the 1950s other medical professionals were beginning to support the use of cvt technologies dr william bierman who was named outstanding physician of the year in 1955 was impressed with the initial results founder of the institute of physical medicine dr bierman studied the effects of injecting a radioactive sodium salt solution into a patients leg pre and post treatment with cycloid vibration therapy based on dr biermans research findings this led to claims relating to blood circulation at that time it was during the 1950s that portable niagara products were designed and manufactured allowing individuals the ability to use cvt treatment at home 1952 founding of the niagara research institute owen k murphy founding father of niagara established the niagara research institute in 1952 the institutes main goal was to research the benefits of using cvt at the helm of the research institute was dr john r mote order of the british empire  a distinguished medical professional dr mote was former chief medical advisor united kingdom to the allied forces in world war ii had discovered cortisone and the birth control pill and was a specialist in oriental diseases two other prominent authorities were also part of the birth of the niagara research institute including dr william edmondson and dr william kolossvary dr edmondson was a mental health disease specialist who worked in calming patients to facilitate communication it was his background in this field and his work at the institute that resulted in findings that led to his belief that cycloid vibration therapy eased nervous tension dr kolossvary on the other hand was a physicist who researched the cvt action this led to the discovery of the cvt action a form of new energy becoming known as cyclotherapy it is the use of cycloid vibration that differentiates cvt from other vibrations  in 1954 owen k murphy the founder of niagara therapy joined forces with dr ed connor a paediatrician to create the fairyland centre concept in the 1950s awardwinning actor walter matthau featured in a television program entitled doctor ed in this program the beginning of the fairyland centre concept was described with matthau playing dr ed connor  1961 niagara in ireland the uk and south africa in 1961 an individual by the name of peter crealey who later became a pivotal part of niagaras international operation joined the canadian team after experiencing success as a sales consultant peter was given rights to distribute niagara products in his native ireland in 1963  the companys first expansion outside of north america due to peters success and at niagaras request peter took over the entire operation in the united kingdom from here peter crealey opened distributor ships in belgium france italy greece sweden south africa and australia  in 1969 niagara arrived in australia niagara is located in the state of queensland in 1985 niagara established sales operations in new zealand through licensed distributors initially and moved to company controlled operations after this time niagara therapy australasia is an independently owned company with its headquarters in queensland the company sources components from both domestic and international suppliers niagara australasia has an international network of distributors selling throughout australia new zealand and asia peter crealey is the current chairman of niagara in australasia  niagara australasia headquarters were based in meadowbrook queensland from 2004 to april 2014 where it manufactured all of its medical devices for the australasian market niagara therapy australasia made the decision to build new premises and invested heavily to improve all areas of its manufacturing and head office completed in april 2014 in parkinson queensland the environmentally conscious design features over 380 solar panels to power the building  niagara therapy has been involved in charity work through efforts at its fairyland centres since 1954 niagara therapy fairyland are rehabilitation centres serving children with physical and emotional disorders fairyland centres offer children a place where they can both receive therapy and spend time away from home the fairyland centres place an emphasis on entertaining children through the use of internally developed therapeutic toys  such as the big red chair and trains the toys used in the centres are designed and manufactured by niagara employees specifically for charity the fairyland centres receive most of their funding from internal sources this includes numerous fundraising events conducted by niagara and its personnel in 1954 the first fairyland centre was established in meadville pennsylvania usa owen k murphy the founder of niagara therapy joined forces with dr ed connor in creating the concept of the fairyland centre   it was owen k murphy  the founder of niagara and individual who bought the patent to the technology  that drove the fairyland centre concept and ensured it was replicated across the world it was also here at the first

V vagus nerve stimulation or vagal nerve stimulation vns is a medical treatment that involves delivering electrical impulses to the vagus nerve it is used as an adjunctive treatment for certain types of intractable epilepsy and treatmentresistant depression   vagus the tenth cranial nerve arises from the medulla and carries both afferent and efferent fibers the afferent vagal fibers connect to the nucleus of the solitary tract which in turn projects connections to other locations in the central nervous system little is understood about exactly how vagal nerve stimulation modulates mood and seizure control but proposed mechanisms include alteration of norepinephrine release by projections of solitary tract to the locus coeruleus elevated levels of inhibitory gaba related to vagal stimulation and inhibition of aberrant cortical activity by reticular activation system  in 1997 the us food and drug administrations neurological devices panel met to consider approval of a vagus nerve stimulator vns the manufacturer cyberonics said it could prevent or reduce seizures in patients with partial onset epilepsy who did not respond to drug treatment the device consists of a generator the size of a matchbox that is implanted under the skin below the patients clavicle lead wires from the generator are tunnelled up to the patients neck and wrapped around the left vagus nerve at the carotid sheath where it delivers electrical impulses to the nerve lasting about 30 seconds every 35 minutes  representatives from cyberonics offered no definitive explanation during the fda meeting of how the device stopped or reduced seizures but they had three studies e03 e04 and e05 to show its safety and efficacy two of the studies e03 and e05 involved 313 patients with treatment resistant partial seizures randomised to high or low dose stimulation the low stimulation arm was intended to avoid the problem of an unblinded placebo arm because all patients would be implanted and told they were receiving stimulation the studies did not include a medical treatment arm for comparison leaving unanswered the question of whether either treatment arm was superior to existing care researchers reported that 25 of patients in the high stimulation arms of the trials achieved the primary end point a 50 reduction in seizure frequency from baseline however 20 of patients in the high stimulation arm had more seizures   although the use of vns for trd has been endorsed by the american psychiatric association the fdas approval of vns for trd remains controversial according to dr a john rush vice chairman for research in the department of psychiatry at the university of texas southwestern medical center at dallas results of the vns pilot study showed that 40 percent of the treated patients displayed at least a 50 percent or greater improvement in their condition according to the hamilton depression rating scale   many other studies concur that vns is indeed efficacious in treating depression however these findings do not take into account improvements over time in patients without the device in the only randomized controlled trial vns failed to perform any better when turned on than in otherwise similar implanted patients whose device was not turned on  charles e donovan a study subject in the investigational trial of vagus nerve stimulation therapy for treatmentresistant depression wrote out of the black hole the patients guide to vagus nerve stimulation and depression dennis fegan subject of the readers digest article medical devices that can kill   because the vagus nerve is associated with many different functions and brain regions research is being done to determine its usefulness in treating other illnesses including various anxiety disorders alzheimers disease migraines  fibromyalgia  obesity  and tinnitus  other brain stimulation techniques used to treat depression include electroconvulsive therapy ect and cranial electrotherapy stimulation ces deep brain stimulation is currently under study as a treatment for depression transcranial magnetic stimulation tms is under study as a therapy for both depression and epilepsy  trigeminal nerve stimulation tns is being researched at ucla as a treatment for epilepsy  the value of the fdas maude database as an early warning system is undermined by two key problems underreporting of the numerator the number of adverse events and the lack of a denominator the total number of exposures one cause of underreporting is that manufacturers do not have to report serious adverse events including deaths if they decide that the event is not related to the device jerome hoffman an expert in clinical epidemiology at the university of california los angeles is critical of the fdas policy of allowing manufacturers to make that determination the manufacturer has a powerful motive to find an alternative explanation for an adverse event theres always the possibility of a separate cause dr hoffman says that the agency should insist on independent adjudication of serious adverse events the databases value could be further improved says dr hoffman by including denominator data its often claimed that even when bad events occur they have to be relatively rare given the huge number of exposures that certainly may be true in some cases but its hard to know for sure in any individual instance because the fda doesnt track the number of exposures it shouldnt be that hard  considering that walmart can apparently track every head of lettuce they sell at every point of its existence of course the fda would have to require that companies submit data on the quantity of devices sold and in use ultimately says dr hoffman the process of ensuring device safety will continue to be compromised unless the thorny problem of interference from politicians and industry is tackled none of this occurs in a vacuum of course if we want to see fewer of these debacles in the future it seems only logical that were going to have to look to root causes such as how campaigns are financed and how the wealthy and powerful get to have so much more influence on laws regulations and policies than do scientists and others who would advocate for making the public health more important than corporate profit however it is not clear that dr hoffmans wish that scientists have greater influence on regulation than industry is likely to be realised any time soon president obama has appointed margaret hamburg as fda commissioner she has said she will step down as director with henry scheinthe largest supplier of medical devices in north america and europe hamburg and her husband who is a hedge fund executive reported their 2008 income at 10m17    cardiac arrhythmia during implantation    along with multitudes of late onset cardiovascular events have been reported       intermittent decrease in respiratory flow during sleep has consistently been demonstrated in patients with vns implants  this seems to be due to an increase in vagal tone  a measure of the control the vagus nerve has over the heartbeat  clinically significant sleep disordered breathing associated with vns has been described in pediatric  and adult  patient populations most patients undergoing vns treatment experience an increase of apnoea hypopnoea index ahi post treatment  up to approximately one third develop mild obstructive sleep apnoea post treatment  and a minority of patients develop severe obstructive sleep aponea related to vns therapy  these obstructive events can be alleviated by decreasing the frequency or intensity of vns stimulation  by having the patient sleep in nonsupine position or by applying positive airway pressure  screening for obstructive sleep apnoea osa in patients with a seizure disorder who are undergoing a vns implant is also important because adequate treatment of previously undiagnosed and untreated osa is likely to result in better seizure control in these patients  vns causes stimulation of the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves and is associated with problems ranging from alteration of voice66 coughing45 pharyngitis35 and throat pain28  and hoarseness very common to frank laryngeal muscle spasm and upper airway obstruction rare  increased muscle tension presumably in the upper body may be experienced during the stimulation period  the left vagus has proportionally lesser number of cardiac efferent fibers and placing the stimulator on this side potentially limits the arrhythmogenic effects of vagal stimulation but reversible bradyarrhythmias associated with vagal nerve stimulators have been well described  other nonspecific symptoms include headache nausea vomiting dyspepsia  dyspnea and paresthesia  in the treatment of epilepsy randomized control trials conducted in the united states indicated that onethird of the patients had some type of an increase in seizures with 17 percent having greater than a 25 percent increase in each of the studies there were patients who had greater than a 100 percent increase in the e05 study the range went up to a 234 percent increase while in the e04 study it went even higher to a 680 percent maximum range   the discovery by kevin j tracey that vagus nerve stimulation inhibits inflammation by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine production has led to significant interest in the potential to use this approach for treating inflammatory diseases ranging from arthritis to colitis ischemia myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure  action potentials transmitted in the vagus nerve activate the efferent arm of the inflammatory reflex the neural circuit that converges on the spleen to inhibit the production of tnf and other proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages there  this efferent arc is also known as the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway  because this strategy targets the release of tnf and other proinflammatory cytokines it may be possible to use vagus nerve stimulation instead of antiinflammatory antibodies eg remicade or enbrel to treat inflammation  a recent study published in science  demonstrated the existence of acetylcholinesynthesizing tcells in the spleen that respond to vagal stimulation resulting in suppression of inflammatory response  tnfalpha via macrophages this is currently the only widely used method of therapeutic vns it requires the surgical implantation of a stimulator device the cyberonics vns devices consist of a titaniumencased generator about the size of a pocket watch with a lithium battery to fuel the generator a lead wire system with electrodes and an anchor tether to secure leads to the vagus nerve the battery life for the pulse generator is between 1 and 16 years depending on the settings ie how strong the signal being sent is the length of time the device stimulates the nerve each time and how frequently the device stimulates the nerve  implantation of the cyberonics vns device is usually done as an outpatient procedure the procedure goes as follows an incision is made in the upper left chest and the generator is implanted into a little pouch on the left chest under the clavicle a second incision is made in the neck so that the surgeon can access the vagus nerve the surgeon then wraps the leads around the left branch of the vagus nerve and connects the electrodes to the generator once successfully implanted the generator sends electric impulses to the vagus nerve at regular intervals  the left vagus nerve is stimulated rather than the right because the right plays a role in cardiac function such that stimulating it could have negative cardiac effects the device is currently only made by cyberonics inc wearable devices are being tested and developed by other companies that involve transcutaneous stimulation and do not require surgery these devices are similar to tens transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices that are often used for pain management this method allows for the stimulation of the vagus nerve without surgical procedure electrical impulses are targeted at the aurical ear at points where branches of the vagus nerve have cutaneous representation specifically the concha has been target for tvns

V a retinal implant is a biomedical implant technology currently being developed by a number of private companies and research institutions worldwide the implant is meant to partially restore useful vision to people who have lost their vision due to degenerative eye conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa rp or macular degeneration there are three types of retinal implants currently in clinical trials epiretinal implants on the retina subretinal implants behind the retina and suprachoroidal implants above the vascular choroid retinal implants provide the user with low resolution images by electrically stimulating surviving retinal cells such images may be sufficient for restoring specific visual abilities such as light perception and object recognition   foerster was the first to discover that electrical stimulation of the occipital cortex could be used to create visual percepts phosphenes  the first application of an implantable stimulator for vision restoration was developed by drs brindley and lewin in 1968  this experiment demonstrated the viability of creating visual percepts using direct electrical stimulation and it motivated the development of several other implantable devices for stimulation of the visual pathway including retinal implants  retinal stimulation devices in particular have become a focus of research as approximately half of all cases of blindness are caused by retinal damage  the development of retinal implants has also been motivated in part by the advancement and success of cochlear implants which has demonstrated that humans can regain significant sensory function with limited input  the argus ii retinal implant manufactured by second sight medical products received market approval in the usa in feb 2013 and in europe in feb 2011 becoming the first approved implant  the device may help adults with rp who have lost the ability to perceive shapes and movement to be more mobile and to perform daytoday activities the epiretinal device is known as the retina implant and was originally developed in germany by retina implant ag it completed a multicentre clinical trial in europe and was awarded a ce mark in 2013 making it the first wireless epiretinal device to gain approval optimal candidates for retinal implants have retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa or agerelated macular degeneration these diseases cause blindness by affecting the photoreceptor cells in the outer layer of the retina while leaving the inner and middle retinal layers intact       minimally a patient must have an intact ganglion cell layer in order to be a candidate for a retinal implant this can be assessed noninvasively using optical coherence tomography oct imaging  other factors including the amount of residual vision overall health and family commitment to rehabilitation are also considered when determining candidates for retinal implants in subjects with agerelated macular degeneration who may have intact peripheral vision retinal implants could result in a hybrid form of vision in this case the implant would supplement the remaining peripheral vision with central vision information  there are two main types of retinal implants epiretinal implants are placed in the internal surface of the retina while subretinal implants are placed between the outer retinal layer and the retinal pigment epithelium epiretinal implants sit in the inner surface of the retina directly stimulating ganglion cells and bypassing all other retinal layers epiretinal implants consist of a silicon platinum electrode array mounted onto the inner retinal layer the array is stabilized using micro tacks along with the slight mechanical pressure provided by the vitreous humour the epiretinal implant requires an external video camera to acquire images  the camera receives an image of the surrounding environment processes the image and communicates the image information to the implanted electrode array wirelessly via telemetry an external transmitter is also required to provide continuous power to the implant via radiofrequency induction coils or infrared lasers the external camera and image processing chip are generally mounted onto eyeglasses for the patient  the image processing involves reducing the resolution of the image and converting the image into a spatial and temporal pattern of stimulation to activate the appropriate retinal cells   the epiretinal implant system must be capable of processing images in real time to prevent any noticeable delays between the camera input and retinal stimulation which could confound visual perception the processing chip may also need to perform additional functions such as motion and edge detection  epiretinal implants are advantageous as they bypass a large portion of the retina relying on the function of ganglion cells in the innermost layer of the retina therefore epiretinal implants could provide visual perception to individuals with retinal diseases extending beyond the photoreceptor layer the majority of electronics can be incorporated into the associated external components allowing for a smaller implant and simpler upgrades without additional surgery  the external electronics also allow a doctor to have full control over the image processing and adapt the processing for each patient  additionally the location of epiretinal implants allows the vitreous humor to serve as a heat sink for the implant  the main disadvantage of epiretinal implants is the need for an external apparatus which can be cumbersome to wear the external camera also requires a subject to make head movements in order to change their gaze epiretinal implants can stimulate not only ganglion cell bodies but also the nearby axons which may be associated with other retinotopic areas this can result in a slightly distorted stimulation pattern which must be corrected during electronic processing  additionally stimulation at the ganglion cell layer requires more sophisticated image processing techniques in order to account for the normal processing associated with the bypassed retinal layers  while an epiretinal implant can be stabilized by the pressure of the vitreous humour mechanical fixation using microtacks may be required to further stabilize the implant onto the inner retinal layer   the first epiretinal implant the argus device included a silicon platinum array with 16 electrodes  the phase i clinical trial of argus began in 2002 by implanting six participants with the device all patients reported gaining a perception of light and discrete phosphenes with the visual function of some patients improving significantly over time future versions of the argus device are being developed with increasingly dense electrode arrays allowing for improved spatial resolution the most recent argus ii device contains 60 electrodes and a 200 electrode device is under development by ophthalmologists and engineers at the usc eye institute  the argus ii device received marketing approval in february 2011 ce mark demonstrating safety and performance and it is available in germany france italy and uk interim results on 30 patients long term trials were published in ophthalmology in 2012 argus ii received approval from the us fda on april 14 2013 fda approval another epiretinal device the learning retinal implant has been developed by iip technologies gmbh and has begun to be evaluated in clinical trials  a third epiretinal device epiret has been developed and progressed to clinical testing in six patients the epiret device contains 25 electrodes and requires the crystalline lens to be replaced with a receiver chip all subjects have demonstrated the ability to discriminate between different spatial and temporal patterns of stimulation  subretinal implants sit on the outer surface of the retina between the photoreceptor layer and the retinal pigment epithelium directly stimulating retinal cells and relying on the normal processing of the inner and middle retinal layers  adhering a subretinal implant in place is relatively simple as the implant is mechanically constrained by the minimal distance between the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium a subretinal implant consists of a silicon wafer containing light sensitive microphotodiodes which generate signals directly from the incoming light incident light passing through the retina generates currents within the microphotodiodes which directly inject the resultant current into the underlying retinal cells via arrays of microelectrodes the pattern of microphotodiodes activated by incident light therefore stimulates a pattern of bipolar horizontal amacrine and ganglion cells leading to a visual perception representative of the original incident image in principle subretinal implants do not require any external hardware beyond the implanted microphotodiodes array however some subretinal implants require power from external circuitry to enhance the image signal  a subretinal implant is advantageous over an epiretinal implant in part because of its simpler design the light acquisition processing and stimulation are all carried out by microphotodiodes mounted onto a single chip as opposed to the external camera processing chip and implanted electrode array associated with an epiretinal implant  the subretinal placement is also more straightforward as it places the stimulating array directly adjacent to the damaged photoreceptors   by relying on the function of the remaining retinal layers subretinal implants allow for normal inner retinal processing including amplification thus resulting in an overall lower threshold for a visual response  additionally subretinal implants enable subjects to use normal eye movements to shift their gaze the retinotopic stimulation from subretinal implants is inherently more accurate as the pattern of incident light on the microphotodiodes is a direct reflection of the desired image subretinal implants require minimal fixation as the subretinal space is mechanically constrained and the retinal pigment epithelium creates negative pressure within the subretinal space  the main disadvantage of subretinal implants is the lack of sufficient incident light to enable the microphotodiodes to generate adequate current thus subretinal implants often incorporate an external power source to amplify the effect of incident light  the compact nature of the subretinal space imposes significant size constraints on the implant the close proximity between the implant and the retina also increases the possibility of thermal damage to the retina from heat generated by the implant  subretinal implants require intact inner and middle retinal layers and therefore are not beneficial for retinal diseases extending beyond the outer photoreceptor layer additionally photoreceptor loss can result in the formation of a membrane at the boundary of the damaged photoreceptors which can impede stimulation and increase the stimulation threshold  optobionics was the first company to develop a subretinal implant and evaluate the design in a clinical trial initial reports indicated that the implantation procedure was safe and all subjects reported some perception of light and mild improvement in visual function  the current version of this device has been implanted in 10 patients who have each reported improvements in the perception of visual details including contrast shape and movement  retina implant ag in germany has also developed a subretinal implant which has undergone clinical testing in nine patients trial was put on hold due to repeated failures  the retina implant ag device contains 1500 microphotodiodes allowing for increased spatial resolution but requires an external power source retina implant ag reported 12 months results on the alpha ims study in feb 2013 showing that six out of nine patients had a device failure in the nine months post implant proceedings of the royal society b and that five of the eight subjects reported various implantmediated visual perceptions in daily life one had optic nerve damage and did not perceive stimulation the boston subretinal implant project has also developed several iterations of a functional subretinal implant and focused on short term analysis of implant function  results from all clinical trials to date indicate that patients receiving subretinal implants report perception of phosphenes with some gaining the ability to perform basic visual tasks such as shape recognition and motion detection  the quality of vision expected from a retinal implant is largely based on the maximum spatial resolution of the implant current prototypes of retinal implants are capable of providing low resolution pixelated images the state of the art retinal implants incorporate 60100 channels which is sufficient for basic object discrimination and recognition tasks however simulations of the resultant pixelated images assume that all electrodes on the implant are in contact with the desired retinal cell therefore the expected spatial resolution provided is even lower as a few of the electrodes may not function optimally  tests of reading performance indicated that a 60 channel implant is sufficient to restore some reading ability but only with significantly enlarged text  similar experiments evaluating room navigation ability with pixelated images demonstrated that 60 channels were sufficient for experienced subjects while nave subjects required 256 channels this experiment therefore not only demonstrated the functionality provided by low resolution visual feedback but also the ability for subjects to adapt and improve over time  however these experiments are based merely on simulations of low resolution vision in normal subjects rather than clinical testing of implanted subjects the number of electrodes necessary for reading or room navigation may differ in implanted subjects and further testing needs to be conducted within this clinical population to determine the required spatial resolution for specific visual tasks simulation results indicate that 6001000 electrodes would be required to enable subjects to perform a wide variety of tasks including reading face recognition and navigating around rooms  thus the available spatial resolution of retinal implants needs to increase by a factor of 10 while remaining small enough to implant to restore sufficient visual function for those tasks clinical reports to date have demonstrated mixed success with all patients report at least some sensation of light from the electrodes and a smaller proportion gaining more detailed visual function such as identifying patterns of light and dark areas the clinical reports indicate that even with low resolution retinal implants are potentially useful in providing crude vision to individuals who otherwise would not have any visual sensation  however clinical testing in implanted subjects is somewhat limited and the majority of spatial resolution simulation experiments have been conducted in normal controls it remains unclear whether the low level vision provided by current retinal implants is sufficient to balance the risks associated with the surgical procedure especially for subjects with intact peripheral vision several other aspects of retinal implants need to be addressed in future research including the long term stability of the implants and the possibility of retinal neuron plasticity in response to prolonged stimulation  the manchester royal infirmary and prof paulo e stanga announced on july 22 2015 the first successful implantation of second sights argus ii in patients suffering from severe age related macular degeneration article in times and bbc these results are very impressive as it appears that the patients integrate the residual vision and the artificial vision it potentially opens the use of retinal implants to millions of patients suffering from amd

V alimlouis benabid is an emeritus professor neurosurgeon and member of the academy of sciences in france who has had a global impact in the development of deep brain stimulation dbs for parkinsons disease and other movement disorders he became emeritus professor of biophysics at the joseph fourier university in grenoble in september 2007 and chairman of the board of the edmond j safra biomedical research center in 2009 at clinatec a multidisciplinary institute he cofounded in grenoble that applies nanotechnologies to neurosciences   alimlouis benabid was born may 2 1942 in grenoble france the son of a doctor from algeria benabid was quoted as saying he could not easily decide between studying physics or medicine  he received his medical degree in 1970 and a doctorate in physics in 1978 both from joseph fourier university in grenoble  he became a staff neurosurgeon at joseph fourier university in 1972 professor of experimental medicine in 1978 and professor of biophysics from 1983  2007  benabid also had a fellowship in 1979  1980 in preclinical neuropharmacology in the laboratory of floyd bloom at the salk institute in la jolla california  from 1988  2007 he directed the preclinical neurosciences unit at the french biomedical and public health research institution inserm and from 1989  2007 served as head of the neurosurgery department at the university hospital of grenoble  in other roles benabid coordinated the claudio munari center for surgery of epilepsy and movement disorders at hospital niguarda in milan italy from 1998 to 2007 and was a staff consultant at the cleveland clinic foundation in ohio from 2000 to 2003  in 2007 benabid joined the french commissariat d energie atomique cea  frances nuclear and renewable energy commission as a scientific adviser during the time a campus for publicprivate innovation was being created the grenoble innovation for advanced new technologies giant campus which includes the minatec research complex and the lifescience cluster nanobio    in 2009 he became chairman of the board of the edmond j safra biomedical research center at clinatec a translational biomedical technology organization he helped found within minatec clinatec was jointly created by cealeti laboratoire dlectronique des technologies de linformationan applied micro and nanotechnology subsidiary of cea grenoble university hospital inserm and joseph fourier university    in 2013 when awarding benabid a 100000 robert a pritzker prize for leadership in parkinsons research to fund continued research the michael j fox foundation said in its award announcement that benabid had published 523 scientific papers achieving an h index of 67 as well as given 18 honorary lectures and received 23 medals and prizes  benabid developed stereotactic surgery methods for brain surgery in patients who had brain tumors or certain types of movement disorder  as part of the work he and his team members created tissue banks using tissue from brain tumor biopsies the tissue samples were used to characterize brain tumors by oncogenic mapping studies of genomics and proteomics have highlighted the factors involved in tumor progression and led to therapeutic advances such as antiangiogenic factors  for patients suffering from parkinsons disease benabid and pierre pollak a neurologist at the university hospital of grenoble also developed deep brain stimulation dbs in 1987    parkinsons disease is commonly treated with medicines such as levodopa to improve muscle control balance and walking but higher dosages tend to be needed over time in this progressive neurological condition and longterm use can lead to motor fluctuations such as tremor rigidity or slowness  prior to development of dbs the main surgical treatment for parkinsons disease was lesioning to inhibit involuntary abnormal motion associated with severe parkinsons disease not controlled by optimal medication  as described in a 2010 interview with benabid in the medical journal lancet electrical stimulation was used during surgery to locate the ablation target and predict lesioning effects to precisely locate the right area an electrode would be placed around the target and those surrounding areas stimulated with physiological frequencies of 20  50hz while observing the patients movement since electrical stimulation itself sometimes seemed to quiet tremor during the procedure benabid reasoned this might be a solution he tested from very low frequencies of 1 5 10hz and more up to 100hz which mimicked effects of ablation without destroying tissue initially the thalamus was stimulated later animal studies indicated the subthalamic nucleus might be a more effective stimulation target as technology advanced to allow such stimulation to be continuously applied for a long time dbs became widely adopted in the 1990s for treatment of movement disorders such as parkinsons disease essential tremor and dystonia   a metaanalysis of six randomized controlled trials published in 2014 showed that in 1184 study subjects dbs significantly improved untreated motor symptoms of parkinsons disease permitting a reduction in medication doses and their associated complications as well as contributing moderately during the phase when the patients were taking parkinsons disease medication to fewer motor symptoms greater function and more quality of life  as detailed in his 2008 biography by the french academy of sciences  and more recent news releases    dr benabid has received a number of awards and honors

V an epinephrine autoinjector is a medical device for injecting a measured dose or doses of epinephrine adrenaline by means of autoinjector technology it is most often used for the treatment of anaphylaxis the epipen is derived from the mark i naak combopen which was developed for the us military for treating exposure to nerve agents in the course of chemical warfare  trademark names for the autoinjector device include epipen emerade twinject adrenaclick anapen jext allerject and auviq   after activation the patient holds the device in place for between 5 and 10 seconds as the epinephrine is delivered this gives the drug enough time to be absorbed by the bodys muscles and diffused into the bloodstream autoinjectors are sometimes used unnecessarily injection into a vein intravenous injection can be fatal it can cause ventricular tachycardia in which the heart beats uncontrollably and is not able to pump blood adequately it can also restrict blood flow to the area of the injection site and damage the extremities  after administering the device patients are advised to seek immediate medical attention an emergency technique not manufacturerapproved to obtain additional epinephrine from a used autoinjector has been published in the medical literature  units that have exceeded their expiration date can still be used in an emergency if an unexpired unit is unavailable and the solution is neither discoloured nor contains precipitates  none of these devices prevent future episodes of anaphylaxis patients who experience severe or lifethreatening reactions may be treated further via allergen immunotherapy for longterm protection a series of allergy injections composed of increasing concentrations of naturally occurring substances such as venom provide excellent and usually lifelong protections against adverse effects of future insect stings the initial injections have a very low concentration usually 1 ppb or less  the devices contain a springloaded needle that exits the tip of the device in some cases through a sterile membrane and penetrates the recipients skin to deliver the medication via intramuscular injection    epinephrine autoinjectors contain a predetermined dose of epinephrine usually between 300\u03bcg   and 500\u03bcg   of active ingredient at a concentration of 11000 they typically contain more medication than the amount needed for a single dose but any extra amount is not intended for use and is inaccessible without destroying the device manufacturers have also made pediatric dosed versions available at 150\u03bcg of active ingredient   there was a version that contained two individual doses in case a repeated application is required previously sold under the trade name twinject  the company that produced twinject autoinjectors shionogi announced that it was discontinuing twinject effective march 30 2012  in 2010 european regulators approved a new epinephrine autoinjector made by alk and sold under the brand name jext    the product was launched in the european union in september 2011  on august 13 2012 the us food and drug administration fda approved a new version of epinephrine autoinjector developed by intelliject  equipped with a sound chip to provide electronic voice instructions   to guide the user in the proper use of the device  the device is made and marketed by sanofi who licensed the north american commercialization rights to it from richmondbased kalo formerly known as intelliject  it is called auviq  in the us the same name initially used by intelliject and allerject in canada  the device is rectangular in shape 35 inches by 2 inches by 05 inch in nearly all countries epinephrine is a prescription drug and therefore obtaining the device requires a prescription from a doctor however according to some published reports epinephrine autoinjectors are an overthecounter drug in some countries but credible information as to the specific countries is not available  the epinephrine autoinjection devices made by drugmaker sanofi sold in the us as auviq and in canada as allerject were voluntarily recalled on october 28 2015   the reason stated by sanofi was that the products have been found to potentially have inaccurate dosage delivery which may include failure to deliver drug    in its news release on october 28 2015 sanofi canada stated that it was actively working with suppliers of alternative epinephrine autoinjectors to have a full stock available in canada as soon as possible canadian customers were asked to immediately return the product to their local pharmacy to obtain an alternate epinephrine autoinjector  the canadian medical association journal on november 3 2015 indicated that availability of the most popular alternative product would be great within a few days because pfizer canada confirmed that it had shipped its entire inventory of epipen products to wholesalers and has ordered five times its usual stock of epipen and epipen jr to meet the unexpected demand  the us food and drug administration confirmed the recall of all current auviq products   on its web site and provided information for affected consumers in the united states sanofi us confirmed on its web site that it will provide reimbursement for out of pocket costs incurred for the purchase of new alternate epinephrine autoinjectors to replace auviq with proof of purchase  the manufacturer of the most popular  autoinjector products mylan indicated after the sanofi recall that it would have a sufficient supply of epipens to meet any anticipated demand

V grady straps are a specific strapping configuration used in full body spinal immobilization   spine trauma and immobilization prehospital care providers such as paramedics and emergency medical technicians emts utilize various immobilization techniques as treatment and management of patients with definite or potential spinal trauma common mechanisms of spinal cord injury include motor vehicle crashes motorcycle crashes pedestrianvehicle collisions falls blunt trauma penetrating trauma and diving accidents  full body spinal immobilization is the process by which a person with obvious or suspected spinal trauma is secured to a long backboard lbb in a neutral inline position  the goal of immobilization is to effectively splint the spine in order to prevent movement and additional damage to the vertebral column and spinal cord   immobilization equipment a long backboard also called a long spine board lsb is a reinforced firm surface with several hand and strap holes along its lateral edges  other immobilization equipment consists of straps or cravats and cervical immobilization devices cids cids which stabilize the neck and reduce movement include a soft or rigid cervical spine immobilization collar also called a ccollar or neck brace  in addition to the ccollar commercial head supports or substituted items such as bulky blankets rolled towels or foam head blocks are placed on each side of the head and then secured to the backboard with tape  straps are used to secure the torso chest and pelvis and extremities arms and legs to the backboard other strapping techniques several different strapping techniques exist for immobilizing the torso so that the thoracic lumbar and sacral sections of the spine are supported with spinal motion restriction   one method calls for three separate straps one at the level of the chest one at the hippelvis and one across the legs  a revised variation of this technique uses two straps for the chest in a diagonal pattern with an additional strap below the knees   spider straps are a commercial alternative that uses a single velcro system with ten points of attachment  grady straps are a specific configuration forming a crisscross x across the chest and a v across the pelvis in a harnesstype fashion using only two long straps  this technique is highly effective for stabilizing both the upper torso shoulders and chest and the lower torso pelvis  grady straps protect against movement in all directions up down left and right and prohibit the patient from sliding on the backboard   because this method prevents anterior posterior and lateral shifts it is very useful for highangle rescues and awkward extrications where the backboard must be rotated sideways or tilted vertically   grady straps are also effective in situations where the backboard must be positioned in a way other than supine such as left lateral recumbent or recovery position for pregnant patients this method also allows the backboard to be tilted in order to facilitate patient care in cases of emetic episodes where protecting the airway against aspiration is crucial  another benefit of grady straps is that they can be applied in a quick timely manner which enables rapid transport for trauma patients  grady emergency medical service grady ems website in atlanta georgia implemented this strapping technique over eight years ago grady straps are the only accepted technique for grady ems field personnel to immobilize a patient with possible spinal injury to a long backboard  members of the atlanta fire department also utilize grady straps the national association of emergency medical technicians naemt website in cooperation with the committee on trauma of the american college of surgeons also recognizes the effectiveness of this technique in the prehospital trauma life support 6th edition textbook

V medtronic is a medical device company headquartered in dublin ireland     the operational headquarters is centered in fridley minnesota usa   medtronic is the worlds largest standalone medical technology development company  in 2015 at the time of its acquisition of covidien medtronics market cap was about 100 billion while the market cap for crhf irelands largest indigenous business was 184 billion  medtronic operates in more than 140 countries  the company employs over 80000 people and has more than 53000 patents    medtronic was founded in 1949 in northeast minneapolis by earl bakken and his brotherinlaw palmer hermundslie as a medical equipment repair shop  through their repair business bakken came to know dr c walton lillehei a doctor in the field of heart surgery then at the university of minnesota medical school the deficiencies of such pacemakers were made painfully obvious following a power outage over halloween in 1957 which affected large sections of minnesota and western wisconsin  as a direct result of this blackout a pacemakerdependent pediatric patient of lillehei died the next day lillehei spoke with bakken about developing some form of batterypowered pacemaker stemming from this need bakken modified a design for a transistorized metronome to create the first batterypowered external artificial pacemaker the company expanded through the 1950s mostly selling equipment built by other companies but also developing some custom devices bakken built a small transistorized pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries work into this new field continued producing an implantable pacemaker in 1960 it built a headquarters in the minneapolis suburb of st anthony in 1960  and moved to fridley in the 1970s medtronics main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include boston scientific and st jude medical in 1998 medtronic acquired physiocontrol for 538 million  in 2005 2008 and 2010 medtronic failed to reach an agreement with peta to improve animal welfare standards in the companys laboratories in the united states and china after critics alleged that they were engaged in the unethical treatment of animals in 2005 peta attempted to stop five specific animal experiments which they deemed crude and cruel in 2008 peta protested the outsourcing of animal testing to counties with lax animal welfare laws such as china in 2010 peta attempted to stop medtronics reported use of live animals in testing and training a practice which peta said had been halted by rival companies in response medtronic conducted a feasibility study to see whether banning the use of live animals was practical this study concluded that it was not and medtronic continues to use live animals for testing and training but has said that they will look for alternatives in the future in each case peta was unsuccessful in reaching an agreement to reduce animal cruelty in medtronics research practices as a result peta withdrew its shareholder resolution compelling the company to address animal welfare issues   after 2008 and the global financial crisis medtronic stock value dropped dramatically despite sales and margin well above the average of most industries with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60 medtronic initiated a series of restructurings in 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 including physiocontrols spinoff for 487 million  and the stock price now approaches prerecession values in may 2014 medtronic agreed to pay over 1 billion to settle patent litigation with edwards lifesciences after years of protracted legal battles   in june 2014 medtronic announced its acquisition of covidien plc of ireland for 429 billion in cash and stock  this was the largest acquisition in its history following the acquisition medtronic ceased to be a minnesotabased company moving its headquarters to lowtax ireland allowing it to avoid taxation on more than 14 billion held overseas   the following

medtronic is composed of six main business units which develop and manufacture devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases including heart failure parkinsons disease urinary incontinence downs syndrome obesity chronic pain spinal disorders and diabetes the cardiac rhythm disease management crdm is the oldest and largest of medtronics business units its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957 when cofounder earl bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally slow heart rates since then crdm has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases crdm has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices an independently operating dutch pacemaker manufacturer vitatron acquired by medtronic in 1986 is now a european subsidiary of the medtronic crdm unit  medtronic and vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by medtronic carelink model 2090 programmer for medtronic and vitatron devices using separate interfaces  in 2007 medtronic recalled its sprint fidelis product consisting of the flexible wires or leads which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart the sprint fidelis leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate resulting in unnecessary shocks or a failure to administer a shock when needed either can be lethal the scope of this problem continues to be a matter of research studies since the recall disputed by medtronic suggest the failure rate of alreadyimplanted sprint fidelis leads is increasing exponentially medtronic liability in this matter is limited by various court decisions  spinal and biologics is medtronics second largest business and medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies in 2007 medtronic purchased kyphon a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants necessary for procedures like kyphoplasty  in may 2008 medtronic spine agreed to pay the us government 75 million to settle a qui tam whistleblower lawsuit alleging that medtronic committed medicare fraud the company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty a spinal fracture repair surgery as an inpatient rather than outpatient procedure thereby making thousands more in profits per surgery  a special report by writer steven brill in time showed that according to medtronics quarterly sec filing of october 2012 the company has on average a 751 profit margin on its spine products and therapies  medtronics therapies in this business span the major specialties of interventional cardiology cardiac surgery and vascular surgery the products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary aortic and structural heart disease products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain common movement disorders and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders medtronic diabetes is the diabetes management manufacturing and sales division of medtronic based in northridge california  the original company minimed technologies was founded in the early 1980s by alfred mann and spun off from pacesetter systems in order to design a practical insulin pump for lifelong wear  most devices at the time were either too large or impossible to program and extremely unreliable the release of the lightweight menudriven minimed 500 series changed the landscape and was a major factor in bringing insulin pump usage to the mainstream in 1996 the minimed was redesigned by the innovation consulting rks design to look more flashy more elegant and resemble a beeper the friendliness of the device boosted adoption rate and sales increased by 357  in the early 2000s medtronic purchased minimed to form medtronic minimed  on 11 may 2009 medtronic announced it had chosen san antonio texas for the location of its new diabetes therapy management and education center the company announced that it expected 1400 new jobs would be created to staff the 150000squarefoot 14000m  facility  the surgical technologies business designs and manufactures products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear nose and throat ent diseases and cranial spinal and neurologic conditions it also encompasses a surgical navigation division that designs stealthstation systems software and instruments for computer assisted surgery cas and a special intraoperative xray imaging system known as the oarm imaging system many of these products are used for minimally invasive surgical procedures jay radcliffe an independent security researcher presented a speech at the blackhat 2011 he revealed a security vulnerability in the medtronic brand insulin pump allowing an attacker remote control of that pump medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of their devices  in 2008 a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a medtronic cardiac implant the team using an unused implant in a lab was able to not only control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component but also glean patient data from the device

V singleuse medical device reprocessing is the disinfection cleaning remanufacturing testing packaging and labeling and sterilization among other steps of a used or in some cases a device opened from its original packaging but unused medical device to be put in service again all reprocessed medical devices originally labeled for single use in the united states are subject to us food and drug administration fda manufacturing requirements and must meet strict cleaning functionality and sterility specifications prior to use  although first regulated in the us the reprocessing of medical devices particularly those that are labeled single use device suds is a global practice with countries in europe asia africa and north america actively engaged in reprocessing  currently approximately 2 of all suds on the us market are eligible for reprocessing by a qualified thirdparty vendor  the us revenue for reprocessed suds is estimated to be around 400million annually    the practice of reusing medical devices labeled for only one use began in hospitals in the late 1970s  after a thorough review by the us fda in 1999 and 2000  the agency released a guidance document for reprocessed suds that began regulating the sale of these reprocessed devices on the market  under the condition that thirdparty reprocessors would be treated as the manufacturer and would meet the same criteria as the original equipment manufacturers oems of the medical device  following the implementation of fda regulation the us congress codified these standards and other requirements in the medical device user fee act of 2002  original equipment manufacturers undergo a thorough analysis to determine whether a device should be singleuse or reusable factors in determining to label a device singleuse include but are not limited to possible infectionsterility concerns and the risk of reduced efficacy depending on the device and its design failure to completely clean a singleuse device could lead to cross patient infection or there is the risk that the chemicals used to clean the device will themselves pose a risk to patients by being absorbed for example by the plastic from which the device is made and then subsequently leaching out into a patients body there can also be the risk of deterioration of the device when exposed to cleaning or sterilization processes which could lead to device malfunction when a manufacturer designs and develops a product it determines the materials used and how the device is labeled  in the us to market a device as reusable a manufacturer must provide increased data requirements and invest the resources necessary to demonstrate to fda that the product can be safely reprocessed at the hospital level  unlike reusable devices singleuse devices are not sold with instructions on how they can be properly cleaned and sterilized nor have they been validated or tested for exposure to cleaning or sterilization processes including chemical exposure and heat commonly reprocessed medical devices include lowerrisk us fda class i noninvasive devices such as sequential compression sleeves tourniquet cuffs and pulse oximeter sensors to mediumrisk fda class ii minimally invasive surgical devices including ear nose and throat microdebriders and cautery electrodes laparoscopic graspers scissors forceps scalpels orthopedic blades bits burs external fixation clamps bolts and components and electrophysiological cardiac catheters  to date the fda has not approved for reprocessing any class iii or higher risk suds the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma and medical device user fee stabilization act of 2005 were signed into law on october 26 2002 and august 1 2005 respectively all medical devices including reprocessed devices are subject to premarket review by the us fda unless the agency has by regulation declared the device to be exempt from premarket requirements  unless exempt the lower risk class i and class ii devices whether original or reprocessed are required to have cleared premarket notification submissions 510ks  with regard to premarket review reprocessors are subject to more stringent regulation by fda than are oems  because mdufma require fda to withdraw premarket notification exemptions for a significant number of previously exempt reprocessed devices although original devices remain exempt from premarket review  reprocessors must also validate the cleaning and sterilization methods they seek to use in the reprocessing of a sud and include in their 510k submissions validation data  regarding cleaning sterilization and functional performance to show that the reprocessed device will remain substantially equivalent  after the maximum number of times the device is reprocessed as intended  both oems and reprocessors are subject to establishment registration and medical device listing medical device reporting medical device tracking reports of corrections and removals the quality system regulation qsr and labeling requirements  fda and the independent us government accountability office gao have concluded that there is no evidence of harm to patients from fdaregulated reprocessed suds a 2008 gao report found that of the over 320000 adverse events filed with fda between 2000 and 2006 only 65 adverse events actually involved or were suspected to involve a reprocessed sud and that the reprocessed sud was one of several possible causal factors in the adverse event in reviewing these 65 reports fda found that the types of adverse events reported to be associated with the use of reprocessed suds were the same types of events that were reported for new devices  the 2008 gao report concluded after reviewing the available evidence  including fdas process for identifying and investigating devicerelated adverse events reported to involve reprocessed suds peerreviewed studies published since 2000 and the results of our and fdas consultations with hospital representatives  we found no reason to question fdas analysis indicating that no causative link has been established between reported injuries or deaths and reprocessed suds  in a separate letter from fda to congressman tom davis and harry waxman dated january 23 2006 fda indicated that a total of 65325 reports have been filed between 2003 and 2006 for the malfunction or injury associated with the first use of devices labeled for single use the same search produced 176 cases of apparent malfunction or injury associated with reprocessed devices upon analysis of the latter reports fda determined that these adverse events were not related to the reprocessing of the single use device  fdaregulated reprocessed devices cost between 4060 of an original device  currently reprocessors estimate that a typical 200bed hospital if taking advantage of a reprocessors full product line can save between 600000 and 1million a year and divert between 5000 and 15000pounds of waste from landfills  according to a study by the commonwealth fund with funding from the robert wood johnson foundation and health care without harm in november 2012 they estimated that from hospitals implementing a reprocessing program cost savings over five years was about 57 per procedure and that if hospitals nationwide adopted an sud reprocessing intervention cost savings would be 540million annually or 27billion over five years  regulated medical waste rmw or red bag waste is a waste expenditure that typically costs hospitals 6 to 10 times more to dispose of than regular solid waste  among the inventory of devices reprocessed annually ninetyfive percent 95 are recycled at the end of their life cycle rather than sent to landfills  a variety of otherwise reprocessable raw materials that end up in a hospitals rmw include stainless steel aluminum titanium gold polycarbonate and polyurethane reprocessing has allowed some hospitals to divert over 8000pounds of rmw from landfills each year while larger systems can divert more than 50000pounds  the association of medical device reprocessors amdr  based in washington dc is the global trade association representing the interests of the thirdparty singleuse medical device reprocessing industry amdr was founded in 1997 and the thirdparty singleuse medical device reprocessors in the association now serve a majority of us hospitals including the countrys honor roll hospitals as ranked by us news  world report  the reprocessing of suds is commonplace worldwide even in developed nations including those that have reprocessing prohibitions in place hospitals routinely reuse suds in an unregulated manner in many cases particularly in africa and asia uncontrolled reuse of such devices is relatively common if not the norm  currently the european union eu does not have a single policy regarding the reprocessing of suds however it is in the process of revising its medical device directive in 1993 at the issuance of the last medical device directive the issue of medical device reprocessing was identified as in need of additional clarification and the european commission was instructed to submit a report on the issue by 2010  in august 2010 the commission released its report  highlighting the risks of unregulated reprocessing ultimately the european commission released its proposal  and the european parliament approved its draft  9 october 2013 both legislative versions propose to regulate reprocessing as manufacturing the european council is now set to approve its own version of the legislation ultimately both the council and parliament will have to agree meeting in trialogue with the european commission on the final version of the legislation it is hoped the final agreement on the regulation will completed in 2015 until then regulation of reprocessing activities is left to the individual member states since 2001 germany has had in place a regulatory framework that does not distinguish between the reprocessing of reusable and socalled singleuse medical devices the guidelines therefore allow for sud reprocessing if conformance with certain standards is achieved the german medical devices law and the medical devices operator ordinance regulate the reprocessing of medical devices and in doing so refer to the mutual recommendation by the robert koch institute rki and the federal institute for drugs and medical devices bfarm for the reprocessing of medical devices  as a result the rkis requirements must be observed institutions which want to reprocess singleuse medical devices must adopt and implement a quality management system according to din en iso 134852007 compliance with the quality management requirements is monitored annually by notified bodies that have been accredited by the central authority of the lnder for health protection with regard to medicinal products and medical devices zlg other member states such as the united kingdom spain and france  discourage or prohibit sud reprocessing the majority of member states in europe do not have any national regulations regarding reprocessing  the lack of resources including medical devices and distribution channels necessitates the reuse of singleuse devices in much of africa  this includes the reuse of syringes and needles that have not been sterilized and even rubber gloves in the middle east available data indicates that reuse of suds is common throughout arab countries particularly for cardiac catheters despite the absence of a regulatory framework reprocessing in both africa and the middle east is done at the userfacility level  israel does not have regulations in place specific to the reprocessing of suds but as a general matter medical devices must be registered with the ministry of health moh before they can be sold in the country if a product is approved by the us fda it will generally be registered by the moh with no further testing requirements and therefore may be lawfully marketed in the country consistent with this policy fdacleared reprocessed devices have been registered with moh and are actively imported into the country  the reuse of suds in much of asia is common particularly for injection needles  for the most part there are no national regulations governing reuse of suds and thus thirdparty reprocessors do not offer their services in asia rather most reuse in asia is conducted in an unregulatedmanner at the userfacility level reprocessing is not currently regulated in japan but available data indicates that the reuse of suds is relatively common a 2003 survey found that 80 to 90 percent of hospitals reused suds  australia enacted regulations regarding the reprocessing remanufacturing in australia of suds in 2003  similar to the us in australia all reprocessors thirdparty hospital and oem must conform to medical device manufacturer requirements as regulated by the therapeutic goods administration tga prior to implementation of these requirements hospital reprocessing of suds was common health canada does not currently regulate reprocessed singleuse devices or the thirdparty companies that are reprocessing these devices for canadian hospitals whether or not to reprocess a singleuse device is determined by the territorial and provincial health ministries as well as hospital boards  a number of provinces have adopted similar positions that allow for the reprocessing of suds if the third party reprocessor is regulated by the fda british columbia issued a policy to its health authorities stating that by january 1 2008 all health authorities must have eliminated the reprocessing and reuse of critical contact suds unless they have been reprocessed by a licensed thirdparty reprocessor that is certified by a national regulatory authority such as health canada or the us food and drug administration  the policy was revised in 2011 with additional information that sharps eg scalpel blades drill bits saw blades shavers and needles shall be singleuse and shall not be reprocessed manitoba does not permit hospitals to reuse suds inhouse but does permit hospitals to contract with an fda regulated vendor among other requirements  alberta health services issued a policy in 2012 prohibiting the reuse and reprocessing of both critical and semicritical singleuse medical devices  since 2005 the northwest territories have prohibited reprocessing specifically the northwest territories department of health and social services revised its hospital and health care facility standards regulations to require that a disposable device intended to be used on a patient during a single procedure shall not be used on a patient for more than one procedure and shall not be used on another patient   in 2006 the ontario ministry of health and long term care endorsed a guidance document developed by its provincial infectious diseases advisory committee pidac advising that critical and semicritical suds must not be reprocessed and reused unless the reprocessing is done by a licensed reprocessor  in 2013 the saskatchewan ministry of health affirmed a policy outlining requirements for hospitals that reprocess suds consistent with the policies of other provinces saskatchewan requires among other things that hospitals outsource to an fda regulated vendor

fourthlargest manufacturer of semiconductors by revenues after intel corporation samsung electronics and texas instruments toshiba is listed on the tokyo stock exchange where it is a constituent of the nikkei 225 and topix indices the osaka securities exchange and the nagoya stock exchange    toshiba was founded in 1939 by the merger of shibaura seisakusho shibaura engineering works  and tokyo denki tokyo electric shibaura seisakusho had been founded as tanaka seisakusho by tanaka hisashige in 1875 as japans first manufacturer of telegraph equipment  in 1904 it was renamed shibaura seisakusho through the first decades of the 20th century shibaura seisakusho had become a major manufacturer of heavy electrical machinery as japan modernized during the meiji era and became a world industrial power tokyo denki was founded as hakunetsusha in 1890 and had been japans first producer of incandescent electric lamps it later diversified into the manufacture of other consumer products and in 1899 had been renamed tokyo denki the merger of shibaura and tokyo denki created a new company called tokyo shibaura denki tokyo shibaura electric \u6771\u4eac\u829d\u6d66\u96fb\u6c17 it was soon nicknamed toshiba but it was not until 1978 that the company was officially renamed toshiba corporation the group expanded rapidly driven by a combination of organic growth and by acquisitions

forming semp toshiba through the combination of the two companies south american operations in 1987 tocibai machine a subsidiary of toshiba was accused of illegally selling cnc milling machines used to produce very quiet submarine propellers to the soviet union in violation of the cocom agreement an international embargo on certain countries to comecon countries the toshibakongsberg scandal involved a subsidiary of toshiba and the norwegian company kongsberg vaapenfabrikk the incident strained relations between the united states and japan and resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two senior executives as well as the imposition of sanctions on the company by both countries  senator john heinz of pennsylvania said what toshiba and kongsberg did was ransom the security of the united states for 517 million in 2001 toshiba signed a contract with orion electric one of the worlds largest oem consumer video electronic makers and suppliers to manufacture and supply finished consumer tv and video products for toshiba to meet the increasing demand for the north american market the contract ended in 2008 ending seven years of oem production with orion in december 2004 toshiba quietly announced it would discontinue manufacturing traditional inhouse cathode ray tube crt televisions in 2006 toshiba terminated production of inhouse plasma tvs to ensure its future competitiveness in the flatpanel digital television and display market toshiba has made a considerable investment in a new kind of display technology called sed before world war ii toshiba was a member of the mitsui group zaibatsu familycontrolled vertical monopoly today toshiba is a member of the mitsui keiretsu a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings and still has preferential arrangements with mitsui bank and the other members of the keiretsu membership in a keiretsu has traditionally meant loyalty both corporate and private to other members of the keiretsu or allied keiretsu this loyalty can extend as far as the beer the employees consume which in toshibas case is asahi in july 2005 bnfl confirmed it planned to sell westinghouse electric company then estimated to be worth 18 billion 1 billion  the bid attracted interest from several companies including toshiba general electric and mitsubishi heavy industries and when the financial times reported on january 23 2006 that toshiba had won the bid it valued the companys offer at 5 billion 28 billion the sale of westinghouse by the government of the united kingdom surprised many industry experts who questioned the wisdom of selling one of the worlds largest producers of nuclear reactors shortly before the market for nuclear power was expected to grow substantially china the united states and the united kingdom are all expected to invest heavily in nuclear power  the acquisition of westinghouse for 54 billion was completed on october 17 2006 with toshiba obtaining a 77 share and partners the shaw group a 20 share and ishikawajimaharima heavy industries co ltd a 3 share in late 2007 toshiba took over from discover card as the sponsor of the topmost screen of one times square in new

V a gel coined by 19thcentury scottish chemist thomas graham by clipping from gelatine  is a solid jellylike material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough gels are defined as a substantially dilute crosslinked system which exhibits no flow when in the steadystate  by weight gels are mostly liquid yet they behave like solids due to a threedimensional crosslinked network within the liquid it is the crosslinking within the fluid that give a gel its structure hardness and contribute to the adhesive stick tack in this way gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid in which the solid is the continuous phase and the liquid is the discontinuous phase gel nonfluid colloidal network or polymer network that is expanded throughout its whole volume by a fluid  note 1 a gel has a finite usually rather small yield stress note 2 a gel can contain note 3 corrected from ref  where the definition is via the property identified in note 1 above rather than of the structural characteristics that describe a gel  hydrogel gel in which the swelling agent is water note 1 the network component of a hydrogel is usually a polymer network note 2 a hydrogel in which the network component is a colloidal network may be referred to as an aquagel note 3 definition quoted from refs      gels consist of a solid threedimensional network that spans the volume of a liquid medium and ensnares it through surface tension effects this internal network structure may result from physical bonds physical gels or chemical bonds chemical gels as well as crystallites or other junctions that remain intact within the extending fluid virtually any fluid can be used as an extender including water hydrogels oil and air aerogel both by weight and volume gels are mostly fluid in composition and thus exhibit densities similar to those of their constituent liquids edible jelly is a common example of a hydrogel and has approximately the density of water polyionic polymers are polymers with an ionic functional group the ionic charges prevent the formation of tightly coiled polymer chains this allows them to contribute more to viscosity in their stretched state because the stretchedout polymer takes up more space see polyelectrolyte for more information a hydrogel is a network of polymer chains that are hydrophilic sometimes found as a colloidal gel in which water is the dispersion medium hydrogels are highly absorbent they can contain over 90 water natural or synthetic polymeric networks hydrogels also possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue due to their significant water content the first appearance of the term hydrogel in the literature was in 1894  common uses for hydrogels include other less common uses include common ingredients include polyvinyl alcohol sodium polyacrylate acrylate polymers and copolymers with an abundance of hydrophilic groups natural hydrogel materials are being investigated for tissue engineering these materials include agarose methylcellulose hyaluronan and other naturally derived polymers an organogel is a noncrystalline nonglassy thermoreversible thermoplastic solid material composed of a liquid organic phase entrapped in a threedimensionally crosslinked network the liquid can be for example an organic solvent mineral oil or vegetable oil the solubility and particle dimensions of the structurant are important characteristics for the elastic properties and firmness of the organogel often these systems are based on selfassembly of the structurant molecules   an example of formation of an undesired thermoreversible network is the occurrence of wax crystallization in petroleum  organogels have potential for use in a number of applications such as in pharmaceuticals  cosmetics art conservation  and food  a xerogel \u02c8z\u026a\u0259ro\u028a\u02ccd\u0292\u025bl is a solid formed from a gel by drying with unhindered shrinkage xerogels usually retain high porosity 1550 and enormous surface area 150900 m g along with very small pore size 110nm when solvent removal occurs under supercritical conditions the network does not shrink and a highly porous lowdensity material known as an aerogel is produced heat treatment of a xerogel at elevated temperature produces viscous sintering shrinkage of the xerogel due to a small amount of viscous flow and effectively transforms the porous gel into a dense glass nanocomposite hydrogels   are also known as hybrid hydrogels can be defined as highly hydrated polymeric networks either physically or covalently crosslinked with each other andor with nanoparticles or nanostructures nanocomposite hydrogels can mimic native tissue properties structure and microenvironment due to their hydrated and interconnected porous structure a wide range of nanoparticles such as carbonbased polymeric ceramic and metallic nanomaterials can be incorporated within the hydrogel structure to obtain nanocomposites with tailored functionality nanocomposite hydrogels can be engineered to possess superior physical chemical electrical and biological properties  many gels display thixotropy  they become fluid when agitated but resolidify when resting in general gels are apparently solid jellylike materials by replacing the liquid with gas it is possible to prepare aerogels materials with exceptional properties including very low density high specific surface areas and excellent thermal insulation properties some species secrete gels that are effective in parasite control for example the longfinned pilot whale secretes an enzymatic gel that rests on the outer surface of this animal and helps prevent other organisms from establishing colonies on the surface of these whales bodies  hydrogels existing naturally in the body include mucus the vitreous humor of the eye cartilage tendons and blood clots their viscoelastic nature results in the soft tissue component of the body disparate from the mineralbased hard tissue of the skeletal system researchers are actively developing synthetically derived tissue replacement technologies derived from hydrogels for both temporary implants degradable and permanent implants nondegradable a review article on the subject discusses the use of hydrogels for nucleus pulposus replacement cartilage replacement and synthetic tissue models  many substances can form gels when a suitable thickener or gelling agent is added to their formula this approach is common in manufacture of wide range of products from foods to paints and adhesives in fiber optics communications a soft gel resembling hair gel in viscosity is used to fill the plastic tubes containing the fibers the main purpose of the gel is to prevent water intrusion if the buffer tube is breached but the gel also buffers the fibers against mechanical damage when the tube is bent around corners during installation or flexed additionally the gel acts as a processing aid when the cable is being constructed keeping the fibers central whilst the tube material is extruded around it recently conde et al developed a selfassembled dualcolor rna triplehelix structure comprising two mirnas a mir mimic tumor suppressor mirna and an antagomir oncomir inhibitor provides outstanding capability to synergistically abrogate tumors  the authors hypothesized that efficacious delivery of the rna triplehelix hydrogel nanoconjugates would be achieved by coating the breast tumor with the adhesive hydrogel scaffold that they have previously shown able to enhance the stability of embedded nanoparticles used for local gene and drug delivery using smart gold nanobeacons  conjugation of rna triplehelices to dendrimers allows the formation of stable triplex nanoparticles which form an rnatriplehelix adhesive scaffold on interaction with dextran aldehyde the latter able to chemically interact and adhere to natural tissue amines in the tumor the authors also show that the selfassembled rnatriplehelix conjugates remain functional in vitro and in vivo and that they lead to nearly 90 levels of tumor shrinkage two weeks postgel implantation in a triplenegative breastcancer mouse model these findings suggest that the rnatriplehelix hydrogels can be used as an efficient anticancer platform to locally modulate the expression of endogenous mirs in cancer the authors reported on a novel strategy for concomitant oncomir inhibition and tumor suppressor mir replacement therapy using a rna triplehelix hydrogel scaffold that affords highly efficacious local anticancer therapy selfassembled rna triplehelix conjugates remain functional in vitro with high selective uptake and control over mir expression compared to their respective singlestranded or doublestranded forms hence cancer gene delivery systems should provide potent selective and specific treatment to tumor cells only unlike the standard delivery of most conventional chemotherapeutic drugs this approach can be implemented to design selfassembled triplex structures from any other mir combination or from other genetic materials including antisense dna or sirna to treat a range of diseases

V in chemistry a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances in such a mixture a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance known as a solvent the solution more or less takes on the characteristics of the solvent including its phase and the solvent is commonly the major fraction of the mixture the concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of how much of that solute is dissolved in the solvent with regard to how much solvent is present   homogeneous means that the components of the mixture form a single phase the properties of the mixture such as concentration temperature and density can be uniformly distributed through the volume but only in absence of diffusion phenomena or after their completion usually the substance present in the greatest amount is considered the solvent solvents can be gases liquids or solids one or more components present in the solution other than the solvent are called solutes the solution has the same physical state as the solvent if the solvent is a gas only gases are dissolved under a given set of conditions an example of a gaseous solution is air oxygen and other gases dissolved in nitrogen since interactions between molecules play almost no role dilute gases form rather trivial solutions in part of the literature they are not even classified as solutions but addressed as mixtures if the solvent is a liquid then gases liquids and solids can be dissolved here are some examples counterexamples are provided by liquid mixtures that are not homogeneous colloids suspensions emulsions are not considered solutions body fluids are examples for complex liquid solutions containing many solutes many of these are electrolytes since they contain solute ions such as potassium furthermore they contain solute molecules like sugar and urea oxygen and carbon dioxide are also essential components of blood chemistry where significant changes in their concentrations may be a sign of severe illness or injury if the solvent is a solid then gases liquids and solids can be dissolved the ability of one compound to dissolve in another compound is called solubility when a liquid can completely dissolve in another liquid the two liquids are miscible two substances that can never mix to form a solution are called immiscible all solutions have a positive entropy of mixing the interactions between different molecules or ions may be energetically favored or not if interactions are unfavorable then the free energy decreases with increasing solute concentration at some point the energy loss outweighs the entropy gain and no more solute particles can be dissolved the solution is said to be saturated however the point at which a solution can become saturated can change significantly with different environmental factors such as temperature pressure and contamination for some solutesolvent combinations a supersaturated solution can be prepared by raising the solubility for example by increasing the temperature to dissolve more solute and then lowering it for example by cooling usually the greater the temperature of the solvent the more of a given solid solute it can dissolve however most gases and some compounds exhibit solubilities that decrease with increased temperature such behavior is a result of an exothermic enthalpy of solution some surfactants exhibit this behaviour the solubility of liquids in liquids is generally less temperaturesensitive than that of solids or gases the physical properties of compounds such as melting point and boiling point change when other compounds are added together they are called colligative properties there are several ways to quantify the amount of one compound dissolved in the other compounds collectively called concentration examples include molarity volume fraction and mole fraction the properties of ideal solutions can be calculated by the linear combination of the properties of its components if both solute and solvent exist in equal quantities such as in a 50 ethanol 50 water solution the concepts of solute and solvent become less relevant but the substance that is more often used as a solvent is normally designated as the solvent in this example water in principle all types of liquids can behave as solvents liquid noble gases molten metals molten salts molten covalent networks and molecular liquids in the practice of chemistry and biochemistry most solvents are molecular liquids they can be classified into polar and nonpolar according to whether their molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment another distinction is whether their molecules can form hydrogen bonds protic and aprotic solvents water the most commonly used solvent is both polar and sustains hydrogen bonds salts dissolve in polar solvents forming positive and negative ions that are attracted to the negative and positive ends of the solvent molecule respectively if the solvent is water hydration occurs when the charged solute ions become surrounded by water molecules a standard example is aqueous saltwater such solutions are called electrolytes polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents forming polar bonds or hydrogen bonds as an example all alcoholic beverages are aqueous solutions of ethanol on the other hand nonpolar solutes dissolve better in nonpolar solvents examples are hydrocarbons such as oil and grease that easily mix with each other while being incompatible with water an example for the immiscibility of oil and water is a leak of petroleum from a damaged tanker that does not dissolve in the ocean water but rather floats on the surface it is common practice in laboratories to make a solution directly from its constituent ingredients there are three cases in practical calculation in the following equations a is solvent b is solute and c is concentration solute volume contribution is considered through ideal solution model example make 2 g100ml of nacl solution with 1 l water water properties the density of resulting solution is considered to be equal to that of water statement holding especially for dilute solutions so the density information is not required mb  c va  2  100  x 1000 20 g

V a spinal cord stimulator is a device used to exert pulsed electrical signals to the spinal cord to control chronic pain further applications are in motor disorders the lumbar spinal cord is a preferred target for the control of spinal spasticity   or augmentation of standing and stepping capabilities     spinal cord stimulation scs in the simplest form consists of stimulating electrodes implanted in the epidural space an electrical pulse generator implanted in the lower abdominal area or gluteal region conducting wires connecting the electrodes to the generator and the generator remote control scs has notable analgesic properties and at the present is used mostly in the treatment of failed back surgery syndrome complex regional pain syndrome and refractory pain due to ischemia   electrotherapy of pain by neurostimulation began shortly after melzack and wall proposed the gate control theory in 1965  this theory proposed that nerves carrying painful peripheral stimuli and nerves carrying touch and vibratory sensation both terminate in the dorsal horn the gate of spinal cord it was hypothesized that input to the latter could be manipulated to close the gate to the former as an application of the gate control theory shealy et al implanted the first spinal cord stimulator device directly on the dorsal column for the treatment of chronic pain  and in 1971 shimogi and colleagues first reported the analgesic properties of epidural spinal cord stimulation  since then this technique has undergone numerous technical and clinical developments  at this time neurostimulation for the treatment of pain is used with nerve stimulation spinal cord stimulation deep brain stimulation and motor cortex stimulation the neurophysiologic mechanisms of action of spinal cord stimulation are not completely understood yet linderoth and others   have noted that the mechanism of analgesia when scs is applied in neuropathic pain states may be very different from that involved in analgesia due to limb ischemia in neuropathic pain states experimental evidence show that scs alters the local neurochemistry in dorsal horn suppressing the hyperexcitability of the neurons specifically there is some evidence for increased levels of gaba release serotonin and perhaps suppression of levels of some excitatory amino acids including glutamate and aspartate in the case of ischemic pain analgesia seems to derive from restoration of the oxygen demand supply  this effect could be mediated by inhibition of the sympathetic system although vasodilation is another possibility it is also probable that a combination of the two above mentioned mechanisms is involved  scs in simplest form consists of a pulse generator with its remote controls implanted stimulating electrodes and conducting wires connecting the electrodes to the generator  the generator implanted subcutaneously could be a complete pulse generator module with its own battery or only a radio frequency rf receiver the former case usually called implantable pulse generator or ipg has a battery of its own and could come with rechargeable battery which can be charged externally via a wireless power charger so that it does not need to be replaced surgically when it loses charge the rf receiver on the other hand is externally driven by a transmitter from which it gets its power and pulses this external transmitter has a battery which can be easily replaced rf receivers have traditionally been used for patients who require high power settings that would quickly deplete a primarycell ipg  the patient is also provided with a remote control to turn on and off the stimulator and depending on the device and the surgeons preference can change the programming of the stimulation patterns the surgeon has a programming device that could be used to modify a wide range of stimulation settings of the rf generator  various current voltage and waveforms configurations are possible sc stimulators come in constant current variable voltage or constant voltage variable current  the electrodes which consist of an array of leads could be percutaneous type or paddle type percutaneous electrodes are easier to insert in comparison with paddle type which are inserted via incision over spinal cord and laminectomy  scs procedure involves careful placement of electrodes in the epidural space a trial period which takes between 57 days and if the results of pain relieving was satisfactory in the trial period anchoring the electrodes to the interspinal ligaments positioning and implantation of the pulse generator tunneling and connection of the connecting wires programming the system for the special pattern of stimulation and performing required postoperative cares  the representation of the dermatomal level in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord is much higher than the corresponding vertebral level for instance the sweet spot for sciatic pain dermatomal level l5s1 is around t10 nerve  see dermatome and spinal cord segments for the scs to be effective the area of paresthesia must overlap the area of pain selection of leads depends on which arrangement will give the best paresthesia coverage to the painful area the ipg or the rf unit is usually implanted in the lower abdominal area or in the posterior superior gluteal region it should be in a location that patients can access with their dominant hand for adjustment of their settings with the patientheld remote control the decision to use a fully implantable ipg or an rf unit depends on several considerations if the patients pain pattern requires the use of many electrodes with high power settings an rf unit should be used the ipg battery life will largely depend on the power settings utilized but the newer ipg units will generally last several years at average power settings  programming involves selecting the electrode stimulating configuration adjusting the amplitude width and frequency of electrical pulses amplitude indicates the intensity of stimulation this is delivered in milliamperes or volts depending on the system used lower voltage or current is chosen for peripheral nerves and paddle leads pulse width usually varies from 100 to 400 us widening the pulse width will also broaden the area of paraesthesia frequency of pulse wave is usually between 20 and 120 hertz it is an individual preference some patients choose low frequency beating sensation whereas others prefer high frequency buzzing  selection of lowest possible setting on all parameters is important in conserving battery life in nonrechargeable models of scs cycling of stimulation is also employed to save battery life changing of stimulator program may have to be undertaken during the course of therapy and followup  appropriate patients for neurostimulation implants must meet the following criteria the patient has a diagnosis amenable to this therapy the patient has failed conservative therapy significant psychological issues have been ruled out and a trial has demonstrated pain relief a trial period of stimulation over a period of 57 days should follow the psychiatric evaluation to demonstrate its effectiveness this part of the protocol is important because of the cost of the equipment and the invasive nature of the procedure the trial is considered successful if the patient achieves more than a 50 reduction in pain  the most common use of scs is failed back surgery syndrome fbss in the united states and peripheral ischemic pain in europe fbss classified as mixed pain syndrome neuropathic and nociceptive is the persistent or recurrent pain mainly involving the lower back andor legs after successful spinal surgery it affects about 40 of patients who undergo spinal surgeries several studies showed overall efficacy of the scs for fbss      scs is also indicated in the treatment of inoperable ischemic limb pain  furthermore this technique is studied in various applications for instance it has been shown to modulate the function of sympathetic nervous system and increase norepinephrine release in refractory angina pectoris  decreasing the probability of angina attack scs units have been used to treat patients with frequent migraines the electrodes are implanted in the bilateral suboccipital region  see   and   for a more complete list and references of further applications complications with scs range from simple easily correctable problems to devastating paralysis nerve injury and death however in a 7year followup the overall complication rate was 518 the most common complications include lead migration lead breakage and infection other complications include haematomas subcutaneous or epidural cerebrospinal fluid csf leak post dural puncture headache discomfort at pulse generator site seroma and transient paraplegia hardwarerelated complications such as electrode migration fractured electrodes and rotation of pulse generator are also reported  they examined 104 patients with failed back surgery syndrome of the 104 patients 60 were implanted with a spinal cord stimulator both groups were monitored over a period of five years the stimulation group annual cost was 29000 versus 38000 in the other group 15 returned to work in the stimulation group versus 0 in the other group the higher costs in the nonstimulator group were in the categories of medications emergency center visits xrays and ongoing physician visits see also  for another study of cost effectiveness see   for list of such studies on cost effectiveness in various applications of scs scs is analgesia on demand it is a useful option when other forms of therapy fail it reduces pain medication and side effects it is effective in about 5070 cases it is an invasive procedure so it can have associated complications such as infection bleeding and dural puncture it has the risk of disconnection or equipment failure  scs interaction with diathermy pacemakers mri and therapeutic ultrasound can result in unexpected changes in stimulation serious patient injury or death it can also lead to failure of the device  scs is finding its way to be applied to parkinsons disease   recently a case study demonstrated the first successful result of this technique in a patient with parkinsons disease  more complex and power efficient microprocessor based equipment increasing the battery life could be developed closed loop biofeedback systems which communicate and record neural responses following spinal cord stimulation could be applied and utilized  in the future it might be possible to combine scs with implanted drug delivery systems to produce synergistic effects minimizing side effects and complications strong evidence is still lacking for scs which may emerge in near future following robust research studies complimenting the rapid technological advances that is taking place in the field of scs  zhou david and greenbaum elias 2009 implantable neural prostheses 1

V toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush as an accessory to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene it serves as an abrasive that aids in removing the dental plaque and food from the teeth assists in suppressing halitosis and delivers active ingredients most commonly fluoride to help prevent tooth decay dental caries and gum disease gingivitis  most of the cleaning is achieved by the mechanical action of the toothbrush and not by the toothpaste  salt and sodium bicarbonate baking soda are among materials that can be substituted for commercial toothpaste toothpaste is not intended to be swallowed due to the fluoride content but is generally not very harmful if accidentally swallowed in small amounts however one should seek medical attention after swallowing abnormally large amounts    in addition to 2042 water toothpastes are derived from a variety of components the three main ones being abrasives fluoride and detergents abrasives constitute at least 50 of a typical toothpaste these insoluble particles help remove plaque from the teeth the removal of plaque and calculus helps minimize cavities and periodontal disease  representative abrasives include particles of aluminum hydroxide aloh3 calcium carbonate caco3 various calcium hydrogen phosphates various silicas and zeolites and hydroxyapatite ca5po43oh abrasives like the dental polishing agents used in dentists offices also cause a small amount of enamel erosion which is termed polishing action some brands contain powdered white mica which acts as a mild abrasive and also adds a cosmetically pleasing glittery shimmer to the paste the polishing of teeth removes stains from tooth surfaces but has not been shown to improve dental health over and above the effects of the removal of plaque and calculus  fluoride in various forms is the most popular active ingredient in toothpaste to prevent cavities fluoride occurs in small amounts in plants animals and some natural water sources the additional fluoride in toothpaste has beneficial effects on the formation of dental enamel and bones sodium fluoride naf is the most common source of fluoride but stannous fluoride snf2 olaflur an organic salt of fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate na2po3f are also used stannous fluoride has been shown to be more effective than sodium fluoride in reducing the incidence of dental caries  and controlling gingivitis  much of the toothpaste sold in the united states has 1000 to 1100 parts per million fluoride in european countries such as the uk or greece the fluoride content is often higher a naf content of 0312 ww 1450 ppm fluoride is common many although not all toothpastes contain sodium lauryl sulfate sls or related surfactants detergents sls is found in many other personal care products as well such as shampoo and is mainly a foaming agent which enables uniform distribution of toothpaste improving its cleansing power  triclosan an antibacterial agent is a common toothpaste ingredient in the united kingdom triclosan or zinc chloride prevent gingivitis and according to the american dental association helps reduce tartar and bad breath   a 2006 review of clinical research concluded there was evidence for the effectiveness of 030 triclosan in reducing plaque and gingivitis  toothpaste comes in a variety of colors and flavors intended to encourage use of the product three most common flavorants are peppermint spearmint and wintergreen toothpaste flavored with peppermintanise oil is popular in the mediterranean region these flavors are provided by the respective oils eg peppermint oil  more exotic flavors include anethole anise apricot bubblegum cinnamon fennel lavender neem ginger vanilla lemon orange and pine alternatively unflavored toothpastes exist hydroxyapatite nanocrystals and a variety of calcium phosphates are included in formulations for remineralization  ie the reformation of enamel agents are added to suppress the tendency of toothpaste to dry into a powder included are various sugar alcohols such as glycerol sorbitol or xylitol or related derivatives such as 12propylene glycol and polyethyleneglycol  strontium chloride or potassium nitrate is included in some toothpastes to reduce sensitivity sodium polyphosphate is added to minimize the formation of tartar although water fluoridation has been praised as one of the top medical achievements of the 20th century  fluoridecontaining toothpaste can be acutely toxic if swallowed in large amounts   the risk of using fluoride is low enough that the use of fullstrength toothpaste 13501500 ppm fluoride is advised for all ages although smaller volumes are used for young children a smear of toothpaste until three years old  a major concern of dental fluorosis is for children under 12 months ingesting excessive fluoride through toothpaste several nonfluoride toothpastes are available the inclusion of sweettasting but toxic diethylene glycol in chinesemade toothpaste led to a recall in 2007 involving multiple toothpaste brands in several nations  the world outcry made chinese officials ban the practice of using diethylene glycol in toothpaste  reports have suggested triclosan an active ingredient in many toothpastes can combine with chlorine in tap water to form chloroform  which the united states environmental protection agency classifies as a probable human carcinogen an animal study revealed the chemical might modify hormone regulation and many other lab researches proved bacteria might be able to develop resistance to triclosan in a way which can help them to resist antibiotics also  with the exception of toothpaste intended to be used on pets such as dogs and cats and toothpaste used by astronauts most toothpaste is not intended to be swallowed and doing so may cause nausea or diarrhea tartar fighting toothpastes have been debated  case reports of plasma cell gingivitis have been reported with the use of herbal toothpaste containing cinnamon  sls has been proposed to increase the frequency of mouth ulcers in some people as it can dry out the protective layer of oral tissues causing the underlying tissues to become damaged  after using toothpaste orange juice and other juices have an unpleasant taste sodium lauryl sulfate alters taste perception it can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness giving food a bitter taste in contrast apples are known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste  distinguishing between the hypotheses that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium lauryl sulfate is still an unresolved issue and it is thought that the menthol added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors  many toothpastes make whitening claims some of these toothpastes contain peroxide the same ingredient found in tooth bleaching gels the abrasive in these toothpaste remove the stains not the peroxide  whitening toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay to remove surface stains whitening toothpaste may include abrasives to gently polish the teeth andor additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate to break down or dissolve stains when used twice a day whitening toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth appear more white whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use but excessive use might damage tooth enamel teeth whitening gels represent an alternative  however the whitening process can permanently reduce the strength of ones teeththe process scrapes away a protective outer layer of enamel  companies such as toms of maine among others manufacture natural and herbal toothpastes and market them to consumers who wish to avoid the artificial ingredients commonly found in regular toothpastes many herbal toothpastes do not contain fluoride or sodium lauryl sulfate the ingredients found in natural toothpastes vary widely but often include baking soda aloe eucalyptus oil myrrh plant extract strawberry extract and essential oils according to a study by the delhi institute of pharmaceutical sciences and research many of the herbal toothpastes being sold in india were adulterated with nicotine  striped toothpaste was invented by a new yorker named leonard lawrence marraffino in 1955 the patent us patent 2789731 issued 1957 was subsequently sold to unilever who marketed the novelty under the stripe brandname in the early 1960s this was followed by the introduction of the signal brand in europe in 1965 uk patent 813514 although stripe was initially very successful it never again achieved the 8 market share that it cornered during its second year marraffinos design which remains in use for singlecolor stripes is simple the main material usually white sits at the crimp end of the toothpaste tube and makes up most of its bulk a thin pipe through which that carrier material will flow descends from the nozzle to it the stripematerial this was red in stripe fills the gap between the carrier material and the top of the tube the two materials are not in separate compartments the two materials are sufficiently viscous that they will not mix when pressure is applied to the toothpaste tube the main material squeezes down the thin pipe to the nozzle simultaneously the pressure applied to the main material causes pressure to be forwarded to the stripe material which thereby issues out through small holes in the side of the pipe onto the main carrier material as it is passing those holes in 1990 colgatepalmolive was granted a patent uspto 4969767 for two differently colored stripes in this scheme the inner pipe has a coneshaped plastic guard around it and about half way up its length between the guard and the nozzleend of the tube is a space for the material for one color which issues out of holes in the pipe on the other side of the guard is space for second stripematerial which has its own set of holes striped toothpaste should not be confused with layered toothpaste layered toothpaste requires a multichamber design eg uspto 5020694 in which two or three layers extrude out of the nozzle this scheme like that of pump dispensers uspto 4461403 is more complicated and thus more expensive to manufacture than either the marraffino design or the colgate design the greeks and then the romans improved the recipes for toothpaste by adding abrasives such as crushed bones and oyster shells  in the 9th century the iraqi musician and fashion designer ziryab invented a type of toothpaste which he popularized throughout islamic spain  the exact ingredients of this toothpaste are unknown  but it was reported to have been both functional and pleasant to taste  it is not known whether these early toothpastes were used alone were to be rubbed onto the teeth with rags or were to be used with early toothbrushes such as neemtree twigs and miswak toothpastes or powders came into general use in the 19th century tooth powders for use with toothbrushes came into general use in the 19th century in britain most were homemade with chalk pulverized brick or salt as ingredients an 1866 home encyclopedia recommended pulverized charcoal and cautioned that many patented tooth powders that were commercially marketed did more harm than good arm  hammer marketed a baking sodabased toothpowder in the united states until approximately 2000 and colgate currently markets toothpowder in india and other countries an 18thcentury american and british toothpaste recipe called for burnt bread another formula around this time called for dragons blood a resin cinnamon and burnt alum  by 1900 a paste made of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda was recommended for use with toothbrushes premixed toothpastes were first marketed in the 19th century but did not surpass the popularity of toothpowder until world war i in 1880 doctor washington sheffield of new london ct manufactured toothpaste into a collapsible tube dr sheffields creme dentifrice he had the idea after his son traveled to paris and saw painters using paint from tubes in york in 1896 colgate  company dental cream was packaged in collapsible tubes imitating sheffield the original collapsible toothpaste tubes were made of lead   fluoride was first added to toothpastes in the 1890s tanagra containing calcium fluoride as the active ingredient was sold by karl f toellner company of bremen germany based upon the early work of chemist albert deninger  an analogous invention by roy cross of kansas city mo was initially criticized by the american dental association ada in 1937 fluoride toothpastes developed in the 1950s received the adas approval to develop the first adaapproved fluoride toothpaste procter  gamble started a research program in the early 1940s in 1950 procter  gamble developed a joint research project team headed by dr joseph muhler at indiana university to study new toothpaste with fluoride in 1955 procter  gambles crest launched its first clinically proven fluoridecontaining toothpaste on august 1 1960 the ada reported that crest has been shown to be an effective anticavity decay preventative dentifrice that can be of significant value when used in a conscientiously applied program of oral hygiene and regular professional care in 2006 biorepair appeared in europe with the first toothpaste containing synthetic hydroxylapatite as an alternative to fluoride for the remineralization and reparation of tooth enamel the biomimetic hydroxylapatite is intended to protect the teeth by creating a new layer of synthetic enamel around the tooth instead of hardening the existing layer with fluoride that chemically changes it into fluorapatite  in june 2007 the us food and drug administration and similar agencies in panama puerto rico and australia advised consumers to avoid certain brands of toothpaste manufactured in china after some were found to contain the poisonous diethylene glycol also called diglycol or labeled as deg on the tube

V the skin cell gun also known as the skin gun or skingun is a medical device that sprays a patients own selfdonated autologous stem cells to treat burns and other wounds the skin gun is used in conjunction with a technique that isolates adult stem cells from a postage stampsized sample of the patients own skin for application to the wound site where they differentiate into normal skin this treatment can replace conventional methods of treating severe wounds such as skin grafting studies demonstrate that damaged skin tissue regenerates after skin gun treatment significantly more quickly than after traditional treatment methods       the skin gun along with related cell isolation methodologies were acquired by renovacare inc in 2013  the company continues to develop the technology and treatment protocol for commercial distribution under the brand names skingun and cellmist system respectively renovacare is also exploring opportunities to apply its skingun treatments to additional indications including chronic wounds pigmentation disorders and cosmetic applications     stem cells from a postage stampsized sample of the patients healthy skin are isolated using a enzymatic tissue processing protocol the resulting cell suspension is then transferred to a sterile syringe which is then inserted into the skin gun using its unique spray mechanism the gun uniformly distributes cells directly into the wound the newly introduced stem cells begin to migrate multiply and differentiate creating new skin tissue in a matter of days the entire process  from collecting the skin sample processing it into a cell suspension and using the skin gun to spray the stem cells  takes approximately 152 hours from start to finish full reepithelialization can occur in as little as four days and after a few months the skin will regain its color and texture   early experimental versions of the device were developed by dr jrg gerlach and stemcell systems gmbh in berlin germany dr gerlach and scs had already developed cell culture bioreactors for culturing usable liver and other solid organ tissues from stem cells and were seeking a similar platform to culture living skin they soon discovered that compared to other organs the skin is a special case a skin wound is itself an accessible environment that provides excellent conditions to culture new skin tissue in vivo this solves the problems of wait times and special challenges in transplanting delicate cultured tissue inherent to in vitro skin culture technologies  researchers developed novel stem cell isolation techniques that maximize stem cell availability for transplantation  to ensure minimal loss in transplanting the isolated cells engineers at stemcell systems designed a deposition device the skin gun to gently deliver the cell suspension without exposing cells to harsh forces in conventional spray devices  the skin gun method was first used experimentally at charit  universittsmedizin berlin on a group of nineteen patients the clinician in that study determined that the results from the skin gun treatment was so significantly better than traditional grafting that he discontinued performing skin grafts on a control group on the basis of medical ethics  subsequently several skin gun procedures have been performed at upmc mercy hospital in pittsburgh including patients who have been able to leave hospital within four days of treatment  after an abrasion cut burn or other injury the body uses several different of biological processes to repair the skin  wound healing generally has three different stages the inflammatory stage the proliferative stage and the remodeling stage  once the skin is damaged a series of interrelated events take place in close succession in order to repair the skin  within minutes after an injury occurs blood platelets collect at the site of injury to form a clot this clot limits bleeding at the injury site the inflammatory phase involves increased white blood cell activity removing bacteria and debris from the wound biochemical signals instruct regenerative cells to begin dividing to create new skin tissues much more rapidly than normal the proliferative phase is marked by the formation of new skin tissue at the injury site and the general shrinking and eventual disappearance of the wound  new blood vessels are also established during the healing process the wound is made smaller by myofibroblasts which hold on to the edges of the wound and slowly get smaller by a system similar to the contraction of muscle cells during the remodeling phase the skin acquires its permanent texture and unneeded cells are disposed of through apoptosis to date skin gun treatment has been used exclusively with second degree burns though there is strong evidence that the treatment will be successful in treating a variety of skin wounds and skin disorders patients with infected wounds or with delay in wound healing are suitable for cell grafting treatment  thirddegree burns however completely deprive victims of both their epidermis and dermis skin levels which exposes the tissue surrounding the muscles the skin gun has not progressed to the point where it can be used for such advanced wounds and these patients must seek more traditional treatment methods the skin gun is generally not used for burn victims with anything less than a seconddegree burn either first degreeburns still maintain portions of the epidermis and can readily heal on their own thus they do not need this expensive technology currently the skin guns applications have not been extended to include the regeneration of skin lost due to other injuries or skin diseases it is also limited in that it is only effective immediately following the burn incident  the average healing time for patients with second degree burns is three to four weeks  this is reduced to a matter of days with skin gun treatment    traditional skin grafting can be risky in that chances for infection are relatively high the skin gun alleviates this concern because the increased speed in which the wound heals directly correlates to the decreased time the wound can be vulnerable to infection because of the rapid reepithelialization associated with skin gun treatment harmful side effects that can result from an open wound are significantly reduced  applying the skin cells is quick and doesnt harm the patient because only a thin layer of the patients healthy skin is extracted from the body into the aqueous spray the electronic spray distributes the skin cells uniformly without damaging the skin cells and patients feel as if they are sprayed with salt water  because the skin cells are actually the patients own cells the skin that is regenerated looks more natural than skin grown from traditional methods during recovery the skin cells grow into fully functional layers of the skin including the dermis epidermis and blood vessels  the regenerated skin leaves little scarring the basic idea of optimizing regenerative healing techniques to damaged biological structures demonstrated by the skin gun in the future may also be applied to engineering reconstruction of vital organs such as the heart and kidneys  there are major limitations the method will not work on deep burns that go through bone and muscle specifically below the dermis as of 2011 only several dozen patients have been treated it remains an experimental not a proven method as of 2011 the skin gun was still in its prototyping stage since it has only treated a dozen patients in germany and the us compared to over 50000 treated with dermagraft bioengineered skin substitute there is thus a lack of published peer reviewed clinical evidence and no knowledge of longterm stability of the newly generated skin the skin gun has been featured in numerous books and television shows including the following examples

V a liposome is a spherical vesicle having at least one lipid bilayer the liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical drugs  liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes such as by sonication liposomes are most often composed of phospholipids especially phosphatidylcholine but may also include other lipids such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine so long as they are compatible with lipid bilayer structure  a liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to unhealthy tissue  the major types of liposomes are the multilamellar vesicle mlv with several lamellar phase lipid bilayers the small unilamellar liposome vesicle suv with one lipid bilayer the large unilamellar vesicle luv and the cochleate vesicle  a less desirable form are multivesicular liposomes in which one vesicle contains one or more smaller vesicles liposomes should not be confused with micelles and reverse micelles composed of monolayers    the word liposome derives from two greek words lipo fat and soma body it is so named because its composition is primarily of phospholipid liposomes were first described by british haematologist alec d bangham    in 1961 published 1964 at the babraham institute in cambridge they were discovered when bangham and r w horne were testing the institutes new electron microscope by adding negative stain to dry phospholipids the resemblance to the plasmalemma was obvious and the microscope pictures served as the first evidence for the cell membrane being a bilayer lipid structure their integrity as a closed bilayer structure that could release its contents after detergent treatment structurelinked latency was established by bangham standish and weissmann in the next year  weissmann  during a cambridge pub discussion with bangham  first named the structures liposomes after the lysosome which his laboratory had been studying a simple organelle the structurelinked latency of which could be disrupted by detergents and streptolysins  liposomes can be easily distinguished from micelles and hexagonal lipid phases by negative staining transmission electron microscopy  alec douglas bangham with colleagues jeff watkins and malcolm standish wrote the 1965 paper that effectively launched the liposome industry around this time he was joined at babraham by gerald weissmann an american physician with an interest in lysosomes now an emeritus professor at new york university school of medicine weissmann recalls the two of them sitting in a cambridge pub and reflecting on the role of lipid sheets in separating the interior of the cell from the exterior milieu this insight they felt was to cell function what the discovery of the double helix had been to genetics bangham had called his lipid structures multilamellar smectic mesophases or sometimes banghasomes it was weissmann who proposed the more userfriendly term liposome   a liposome has an aqueous solution core surrounded by a hydrophobic membrane in the form of a lipid bilayer hydrophilic solutes dissolved in the core cannot readily pass through the bilayer hydrophobic chemicals associate with the bilayer a liposome can be hence loaded with hydrophobic andor and hydrophilic molecules to deliver the molecules to a site of action the lipid bilayer can fuse with other bilayers such as the cell membrane thus delivering the liposome contents this is a complex and nonspontaneous event however  by preparing liposomes in a solution of dna or drugs which would normally be unable to diffuse through the membrane they can be indiscriminately delivered past the lipid bilayer but are then typically distributed nonhomogeneously  liposomes are used as models for artificial cells liposomes can also be designed to deliver drugs in other ways liposomes that contain low or high ph can be constructed such that dissolved aqueous drugs will be charged in solution ie the ph is outside the drugs pi range as the ph naturally neutralizes within the liposome protons can pass through some membranes the drug will also be neutralized allowing it to freely pass through a membrane these liposomes work to deliver drug by diffusion rather than by direct cell fusion a similar approach can be exploited in the biodetoxification of drugs by injecting empty liposomes with a transmembrane ph gradient in this case the vesicles act as sinks to scavenge the drug in the blood circulation and prevent its toxic effect  another strategy for liposome drug delivery is to target endocytosis events liposomes can be made in a particular size range that makes them viable targets for natural macrophage phagocytosis these liposomes may be digested while in the macrophages phagosome thus releasing its drug liposomes can also be decorated with opsonins and ligands to activate endocytosis in other cell types the use of liposomes for transformation or transfection of dna into a host cell is known as lipofection in addition to gene and drug delivery applications liposomes can be used as carriers for the delivery of dyes to textiles  pesticides to plants enzymes and nutritional supplements to foods and cosmetics to the skin  liposomes are also used as outer shells of some microbubble contrast agents used in contrastenhanced ultrasound as of 2012 13 drugs with liposomal delivery systems have been approved and five additional liposomal drugs were in clinical trials  list of clinically approved liposomal drugs regarding the use of liposomes as a carrier of dietary and nutritional supplements until very recently the use of liposomes were primarily directed at targeted drug delivery however the versatile abilities of liposomes are now being discovered in other settings liposomes are presently being cleverly implemented for the specific oral delivery of certain dietary and nutritional supplements  a very small number of dietary and nutritional supplement companies are currently pioneering the benefits of this unique science towards this new application this new direction and employment of liposome science is in part due to the low absorption and bioavailability rates of traditional oral dietary and nutritional tablets and capsules the low oral bioavailability and absorption of many nutrients is clinically well documented  therefore the natural encapsulation of lypophilic and hydrophilic nutrients within liposomes has made for a very effective method of bypassing the destructive elements of the gastric system and aiding the encapsulated nutrient to be delivered to the cells and tissues  it is important to note that certain influential factors have far reaching effects on the percentage of liposome that are yielded in manufacturing  these influences also have an effect on the actual amount of realized liposome entrapment and the actual quality of the liposomes themselves these are very crucial elements which lead to the long term stability of the liposomes these complex yet significant factors are the following 1 the actual manufacturing method and preparation of the liposomes themselves 2 the constitution quality and type of raw phospholipid used in the formulation and manufacturing of the liposomes 3 the ability to create homogeneous liposome particle sizes that are stable and hold their encapsulated payload these primary and key elements comprise the foundation of an effective liposome carrier for use in increasing the bioavailability of oral dosages of dietary and nutritional supplements  the choice of liposome preparation method depends ia on the following parameters   useful liposomes rarely form spontaneously they typically form after supplying enough energy to a dispersion of phospholipids in a polar solvent such as water to break down multilamellar aggregates into oligo or unilamellar bilayer vesicles   liposomes can hence be created by sonicating a dispersion of amphipatic lipids such as phospholipids in water  low shear rates create multilamellar liposomes the original aggregates which have many layers like an onion thereby form progressively smaller and finally unilamellar liposomes which are often unstable owing to their small size and the sonicationcreated defects sonication is generally considered a gross method of preparation as it can damage the structure of the drug to be encapsulated newer methods such as extrusion and mozafari method   are employed to produce materials for human use using lipids other than phosphatidylcholine can greatly facilitate liposome preparation  further advances in liposome research have been able to allow liposomes to avoid detection by the bodys immune system specifically the cells of reticuloendothelial system res these liposomes are known as stealth liposomes they were first proposed by g cevc and g blume  and independently and soon thereafter the groups of l huang and v torchilin  and are constructed with peg polyethylene glycol studding the outside of the membrane the peg coating which is inert in the body allows for longer circulatory life for the drug delivery mechanism however research currently seeks to investigate at what amount of peg coating the peg actually hinders binding of the liposome to the delivery site in addition to a peg coating most stealth liposomes also have some sort of biological species attached as a ligand to the liposome to enable bind via a specific expression on the targeted drug delivery site these targeting ligands could be monoclonal antibodies making an immunoliposome vitamins or specific antigens but must be accessible  targeted liposomes can target nearly any cell type in the body and deliver drugs that would naturally be systemically delivered naturally toxic drugs can be much less toxic if delivered only to diseased tissues polymersomes morphologically related to liposomes can also be used this way also morphologically related to liposomes are highly deformable vesicles designed for noninvasive transdermal material delivery known as transfersomes  in case of tumor development certain anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin doxil and daunorubicin are provided through liposomes liposomal cisplatin has received orphan drug designation for pancreatic cancer from emea

V in medicine a prosthesis plural prostheses from ancient greek prsthesis addition application attachment  is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part which may be lost through trauma disease or congenital conditions prosthetic amputee rehabilitation is primarily coordinated by a prosthetist and an interdisciplinary team of health care professionals including psychiatrists surgeons physical therapists and occupational therapists   a persons prosthesis should be designed and assembled according to the patients appearance and functional needs for instance a patient may need a transradial prosthesis but need to choose between an aesthetic functional device a myoelectric device a bodypowered device or an activity specific device the patients future goals and economical capabilities may help them choose between one or more devices craniofacial prostheses include intraoral and extraoral prostheses extraoral prostheses are further divided into hemifacial auricular ear nasal orbital and ocular intraoral prostheses include dental prostheses such as dentures obturators and dental implants prostheses of the neck include larynx substitutes trachea and upper esophageal replacements somato prostheses of the torso include breast prostheses which may be either single or bilateral full breast devices or nipple prostheses limb prostheses include both upper and lowerextremity prostheses upperextremity prostheses are used at varying levels of amputation forequarter shoulder disarticulation transhumeral prosthesis elbow disarticulation transradial prosthesis wrist disarticulation full hand partial hand finger partial finger a transradial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces an arm missing below the elbow two main types of prosthetics are available cable operated limbs work by attaching a harness and cable around the opposite shoulder of the damaged arm the other form of prosthetics available are myoelectric arms these work by sensing via electrodes when the muscles in the upper arm move causing an artificial hand to open or close in the prosthetic industry a transradial prosthetic arm is often referred to as a be or below elbow prosthesis lowerextremity prostheses provide replacements at varying levels of amputation these include hip disarticulation transfemoral prosthesis knee disarticulation transtibial prosthesis symes amputation foot partial foot and toe the two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are transtibial any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency and transfemoral any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency a transfemoral prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing above the knee transfemoral amputees can have a very difficult time regaining normal movement in general a transfemoral amputee must use approximately 80 more energy to walk than a person with two whole legs  this is due to the complexities in movement associated with the knee in newer and more improved designs hydraulics carbon fiber mechanical linkages motors computer microprocessors and innovative combinations of these technologies are employed to give more control to the user in the prosthetic industry a transfemoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an ak or above the knee prosthesis  a transtibial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing below the knee a transtibial amputee is usually able to regain normal movement more readily than someone with a transfemoral amputation due in large part to retaining the knee which allows for easier movement lower extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower in the prosthetic industry a transtibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a bk or below the knee prosthesis prosthetics have been mentioned throughout history the earliest recorded mention is the warrior queen vishpala in the rigveda  the egyptians were early pioneers of the idea as shown by the wooden toe found on a body from the new kingdom  roman bronze crowns have also been found but their use could have been more aesthetic than medical  an early mention of a prosthetic comes from the greek historian herodotus who tells the story of hegesistratus a greek diviner who cut off his own foot to escape his spartan captors and replaced it with a wooden one  pliny the elder also recorded the tale of a roman general marcus sergius whose right hand was cut off while campaigning and had an iron hand made to hold his shield so that he could return to battle a famous and quite refined  historical prosthetic arm was that of gtz von berlichingen made at the beginning of the 16th century the first confirmed use of a prosthetic device however is from 950710 bce in 2000 research pathologists discovered a mummy from this period buried in the egyptian necropolis near ancient thebes that possessed an artificial big toe this toe consisting of wood and leather exhibited evidence of use when reproduced by biomechanical engineers in 2011 researchers discovered that this ancient prosthetic enabled its wearer to walk both barefoot and in egyptian style sandals previously the earliest discovered prosthetic was an artificial leg from capua  around the same time franois de la noue is also reported to have had an iron hand as is in the 17th century renrobert cavalier de la salle  during the middle ages prosthetic remained quite basic in form debilitated knights would be fitted with prosthetics so they could hold up a shield grasp a lance or a sword or stabilize a mounted warrior  only the wealthy could afford anything that would assist in daily life  during the renaissance prosthetics developed with the use of iron steel copper and wood functional prosthetics began to make an appearance in the 1500s  an italian surgeon recorded the existence of an amputee who had an arm that allowed him to remove his hat open his purse and sign his name  improvement in amputation surgery and prosthetic design came at the hands of ambroise par among his inventions was an aboveknee device that was a kneeling peg leg and foot prosthesis with a fixed position adjustable harness and knee lock control the functionality of his advancements showed how future prosthetics could develop other major improvements before the modern era at the end of world war ii the nas national academy of sciences began to advocate better research and development of prosthetics through government funding a research and development program was developed within the army navy air force and the veterans administration socket technology for lower extremity limbs saw a revolution of advancement during the 1980s when john sabolich cpo invented the contoured adducted trochantericcontrolled alignment method catcam socket later to evolve into the sabolich socket he followed the direction of ivan long and ossur christensen as they developed alternatives to the quadrilateral socket which in turn followed the open ended plug socket created from wood  the advancement was due to the difference in the socket to patient contact model prior to this sockets were made in the shape of a square shape with no specialized containment for muscular tissue new designs thus help to lock in the bony anatomy locking it into place and distributing the weight evenly over the existing limb as well as the musculature of the patient ischial containment is well known and used today by many prosthetist to help in patient care variations of the ischial containment socket thus exists and each socket is tailored to the specific needs of the patient others who contributed to socket development and changes over the years include tim staats chris hoyt and frank gottschalk gottschalk disputed the efficacy of the catcam socket insisting the surgical procedure done by the amputation surgeon was most important to prepare the amputee for good use of a prosthesis of any type socket design  the first microprocessorcontrolled prosthetic knees became available in the early 1990s the intelligent prosthesis was first commercially available microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee it was released by chas a blatchford  sons ltd of great britain in 1993 and made walking with the prosthesis feel and look more natural  an improved version was released in 1995 by the name intelligent prosthesis plus blatchford released another prosthesis the adaptive prosthesis in 1998 the adaptive prosthesis utilized hydraulic controls pneumatic controls and a microprocessor to provide the amputee with a gait that was more responsive to changes in walking speed cost analysis reveals that a sophisticated aboveknee prosthesis will be about 1 million in 45 years given only annual cost of living adjustments  a prosthesis is a functional replacement for an amputated or congenitally malformed or missing limb prosthetists are responsible for the prescription design and management of a prosthetic device in most cases the prosthetist begins by taking a plaster cast of the patients affected limb lightweight highstrength thermoplastics are customformed to this model of the patient cuttingedge materials such as carbon fiber titanium and kevlar provide strength and durability while making the new prosthesis lighter more sophisticated prostheses are equipped with advanced electronics providing additional stability and control  over the years there have been advancements in artificial limbs new plastics and other materials such as carbon fiber have allowed artificial limbs to be stronger and lighter limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb this is especially important for transfemoral amputees additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic which is important to transradial and transhumeral amputees because they are more likely to have the artificial limb exposed  in addition to new materials the use of electronics has become very common in artificial limbs myoelectric limbs which control the limbs by converting muscle movements to electrical signals have become much more common than cable operated limbs myoelectric signals are picked up by electrodes the signal gets integrated and once it exceeds a certain threshold the prosthetic limb control signal is triggered which is why inherently all myoelectric controls lag conversely cable control is immediate and physical and through that offers a certain degree of direct force feedback that myoelectric control does not computers are also used extensively in the manufacturing of limbs computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing are often used to assist in the design and manufacture of artificial limbs   most modern artificial limbs are attached to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction the stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic ormore commonly todaya liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum suction sockets or a pin lock liners are soft and by that they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes mostly with a circular round cross section but for any other stump shape custom liners can be made the socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump rather than just one small spot which helps reduce wear on the stump the custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or more commonly today of the liner worn over the stump and then making a mold from the plaster cast newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design one problem with the stump and socket attachment is that a bad fit will reduce the area of contact between the stump and socket or liner and increase pockets between stump skin and socket or liner pressure then is higher which can be painful air pockets can allow sweat to accumulate that can soften the skin ultimately this is a frequent cause for itchy skin rashes further down the road it can cause breakdown of the skin  artificial limbs are typically manufactured using the following steps  current high tech allows body powered arms to weigh around onehalf to onethird of what a myoelectric arm does current bodypowered arms contain sockets that are built from hard epoxy or carbon fiber these sockets or interfaces can be made more comfortable by lining them with a softer compressible foam material that provides padding for the bone prominences a self suspending or supracondylar socket design is useful for those with short to mid range below elbow absence longer limbs may require the use of a locking rollon type inner liner or more complex harnessing to help augment suspension wrist units are either screwon connectors featuring the unf 1220 thread usa or quickrelease connector of which there are different models two types of body powered systems exist voluntary opening pull to open and voluntary closing pull to close virtually all split hook prostheses operate with a voluntary opening type system more modern prehensors called grips utilize voluntary closing systems the differences are significant users of voluntary opening systems rely on elastic bands or springs for gripping force while users of voluntary closing systems rely on their own body power and energy to create gripping force voluntary closing users can generate prehension forces equivalent to the normal hand upwards to or exceeding one hundred pounds voluntary closing grips require constant tension to grip like a human hand and in that property they do come closer to matching human hand performance voluntary opening split hook users are limited to forces their rubber or springs can generate which usually is below twenty pounds an additional difference exists in the biofeedback created that allows the user to feel what is being held voluntary opening systems once engaged provide the holding force so that they operate like a passive vice at the end of the arm no gripping feedback is provided once the hook has closed around the object being held voluntary closing systems provide directly proportional control and biofeedback so that the user can feel how much force that they are applying a recent study showed that by stimulating the median and ulnar nerves according to the information provided by the artificial sensors from a hand prosthesis physiologically appropriate nearnatural sensory information could be provided to an amputee this feedback enabled the participant to effectively modulate the grasping force of the prosthesis with no visual or auditory feedback  researchers from cole polytechnique fdrale de lausanne in switzerland and the scuola superiore santanna in italy implanted the electrodes into the amputees arm in february 2013 the study published wednesday  in science translational medicine details the first time sensory feedback has been restored allowing an amputee to control an artificial limb in realtime  with wires linked to nerves in his upper arm the danish patient was able to handle objects and instantly receive a sense of touch through the special artificial hand that was created by silvestro micera and researchers both in switzerland and italy  terminal devices contain a range of hooks prehensors hands or other devices voluntary opening split hook systems are simple convenient light robust versatile and relatively affordable hooks obviously do not match human hand in both appearance and overall versatility however a hooks material tolerances can also exceed and surpass the human hand for mechanical stress one can use a hook to slice open boxes or as a hammer whereas same is not possible with a hand for thermal stability one can use a hook to grip items from boiling water to turn meat on a grill to hold a match until it has burned down completely and for chemical hazards as a metal hook withstands acids or lye and does not react to solvents as a prosthetic glove or human skin does prosthetic hands are available in both voluntary opening and voluntary closing versions and because of their more complex mechanics and cosmetic glove covering require a relatively large activation force which depending on the type of harness used may be uncomfortable  a recent study by the delft university of technology the netherlands showed that the development of mechanical prosthetic hands has been neglected during the past decades the study showed that the pinch force level of most current mechanical hands is too low for practical use  the best tested hand was a prosthetic hand developed around 1945 hosmer and otto bock are major commercial hook providers mechanical hands are sold by hosmer and otto bock as well the becker hand is still manufactured by the becker family prosthetic hands may be fitted with standard stock or custommade cosmetic looking silicone gloves but regular work gloves may be worn as well other terminal devices include the v2p prehensor a versatile robust gripper that allows customers to modify aspects of it texas assist devices with a whole assortment of tools and trs that offers a range of terminal devices for sports cable harnesses can be built using aircraft steel cables ball hinges and self lubricating cable sheaths some prosthetics have been designed specifically for use in salt water  lowerextremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower concerning all ages ephraim et al 2003 found a worldwide estimate of allcause lowerextremity amputations of 20 59 per 10000 inhabitants for birth prevalence rates of congenital limb deficiency they found an estimate between 35 71 cases per 10000 births  the two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are 1transtibial any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency and 2transfemoral any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency in the prosthetic industry a transtibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a bk or below the knee prosthesis while the transfemoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an ak or above the knee prosthesis other less prevalent lower extremity cases include the following this important part serves as an interface between the residuum and the prosthesis allowing comfortable weightbearing movement control and proprioception  its fitting is one of the most challenging aspects of the entire prosthesis the difficulties accompanied with the socket are that it needs to have a perfect fit with total surface bearing to prevent painful pressure spots it needs to be flexible but sturdy to allow normal gait movement but not bend under pressure this part creates distance and support between the kneejoint and the foot in case of upperleg prosthesis or between the socket and the foot the type of connectors that are used between the shank and the kneefoot determines whether the prosthesis is modular or not modular means that the angle and the displacement of the foot in respect to the socket can be changed after fitting in developing countries prosthesis mostly are nonmodular in order to reduce cost when considering children modularity of angle and height is important because of their average growth of 19cm annually  providing contact to the ground the foot provides shock absorption and stability during stance  additionally it influences gait biomechanics by its shape and stiffness this is because the trajectory of the center of pressure cop and the angle of the ground reaction forces is determined by the shape and stiffness of the foot and needs to match the subjects build in order to produce a normal gait pattern  andrysek 2010 found 16 different types of feet with greatly varying results concerning durability and biomechanics the main problem found in current feet is durability endurance ranging from 1632 months   these results are for adults and will probably be worse for children due to higher activity levels and scale effects in case of a transfemoral amputation there also is a need for a complex connector providing articulation allowing flexion during swingphase but not during stance to mimic the knees functionality during gait microprocessorcontrolled knee joints have been developed that control the flexion of the knee some examples are otto bocks cleg introduced in 1997 ossurs rheo knee released in 2005 the power knee by ossur introduced in 2006 the pli knee from freedom innovations  and daw industries self learning knee slk  the idea was originally developed by kelly james a canadian engineer at the university of alberta  a microprocessor is used to interpret and analyse signals from kneeangle sensors and moment sensors the microprocessor receives signals from its sensors to determine the type of motion being employed by the amputee most microprocessor controlled kneejoints are powered by a battery housed inside the prosthesis the sensory signals computed by the microprocessor are used to control the resistance generated by hydraulic cylinders in the kneejoint small valves control the amount of hydraulic fluid that can pass into and out of the cylinder thus regulating the extension and compression of a piston connected to the upper section of the knee  the main advantage of a microprocessorcontrolled prosthesis is closer approximation to an amputees natural gait some allow amputees to walk near walking speed or run variations in speed are also possible and are taken into account by sensors and communicated to the microprocessor which adjusts to these changes accordingly it also enables the amputees to walk down stairs with a stepoverstep approach rather than the one step at a time approach used with mechanical knees  however some have some significant drawbacks that impair its use they can be susceptible to water damage and thus great care must be taken to ensure that the prosthesis remains dry a myoelectric prosthesis uses electromyography signals or potentials from voluntarily contracted muscles within a persons residual limb on the surface of the skin to control the movements of the prosthesis such as elbow flexionextension wrist supinationpronation rotation or hand openingclosing of the fingers a prosthesis of this type utilizes the residual neuromuscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand wrist elbow or foot  this is as opposed to an electric switch prosthesis which requires straps andor cables actuated by body movements to actuate or operate switches that control the movements of a prosthesis or one that is totally mechanical it is not clear whether those few prostheses that provide feedback signals to those muscles are also myoelectric in nature it has a selfsuspending socket with pickup electrodes placed over flexors and extensors for the movement of flexion and extension respectively the ussr was the first to develop a myoelectric arm in 1958  while the first myoelectric arm became commercial in 1964 by the central prosthetic research institute of the ussr and distributed by the hangar limb factory of the uk   researchers at the rehabilitation institute of chicago announced in september 2013 that they have developed a robotic leg that translates neural impulses from the users thigh muscles into movement which is the first prosthetic leg to do so it is currently in testing  robots can be used to generate objective measures of patients impairment and therapy outcome assist in diagnosis customize therapies based on patients motor abilities and assure compliance with treatment regimens and maintain patients records it is shown in many studies that there is a significant improvement in upper limb motor function after stroke using robotics for upper limb rehabilitation  in order for a robotic prosthetic limb to work it must have several components to integrate it into the bodys function biosensors detect signals from the users nervous or muscular systems it then relays this information to a controller located inside the device and processes feedback from the limb and actuator eg position force and sends it to the controller examples include surface electrodes that detect electrical activity on the skin needle electrodes implanted in muscle or solidstate electrode arrays with nerves growing through them one type of these biosensors are employed in myoelectric prostheses a device known as the controller is connected to the users nerve and muscular systems and the device itself it sends intention commands from the user to the actuators of the device and interprets feedback from the mechanical and biosensors to the user the controller is also responsible for the monitoring and control of the movements of the device an actuator mimics the actions of a muscle in producing force and movement examples include a motor that aids or replaces original muscle tissue targeted muscle reinnervation tmr is a technique in which motor nerves which previously controlled muscles on an amputated limb are surgically rerouted such that they reinnervate a small region of a large intact muscle such as the pectoralis major as a result when a patient thinks about moving the thumb of his missing hand a small area of muscle on his chest will contract instead by placing sensors over the reinervated muscle these contractions can be made to control movement of an appropriate part of the robotic prosthesis   a variant of this technique is called targeted sensory reinnervation tsr this procedure is similar to tmr except that sensory nerves are surgically rerouted to skin on the chest rather than motor nerves rerouted to muscle recently robotic limbs have improved in their ability to take signals from the human brain and translate those signals into motion in the artificial limb darpa the pentagons research division is working to make even more advancements in this area their desire is to create an artificial limb that ties directly into the nervous system  advancements in the processors used in myoelectric arms has allowed developers to make gains in fine tuned control of the prosthetic the boston digital arm is a recent artificial limb that has taken advantage of these more advanced processors the arm allows movement in five axes and allows the arm to be programmed for a more customized feel recently the ilimb hand invented in edinburgh scotland by david gow has become the first commercially available hand prosthesis with five individually powered digits the hand also possesses a manually rotatable thumb which is operated passively by the user and allows the hand to grip in precision power and key grip modes another neural prosthetic is johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory proto 1 besides the proto 1 the university also finished the proto 2 in 2010  early in 2013 max ortiz catalan and rickard brnemark of the chalmers university of technology and sahlgrenska university hospital in sweden succeeded in making the first robotic arm which is mindcontrolled and can be permanently attached to the body using osseointegration    an approach that is very useful is called arm rotation which is common for unilateral amputees which is an amputation that affects only one side of the body and also essential for bilateral amputees a person who is missing or has had amputated either both arms or legs to perform tasks of daily living this involves inserting a small permanent magnet into the distal end of the residual bone of subjects with upper limb amputations when a subject rotates the residual arm the magnet will rotate with the residual bone causing a change in magnetic field distribution  eeg signals which is electroencephalogram a test that detects electrical activity in the brain using small flat metal discs attached to your scalp essentially decoding human brain activity used for physical movement are used to control the robotic limbs this is very essential being that it provides a more lively affect to the robotic limb giving oneself control over the part as if it was their own  robotic legs have also been developed the argo medical technologies rewalk is an example or a recent robotic leg targeted to replace the wheelchair it is marketed as a robotic pants  walk again project is developing a similar device  most prostheses can be attached to the exterior of the body in a nonpermanent way some others however can be attached in a permanent way one such example are exoprostheses see below osseointegration is a method of attaching the artificial limb to the body this method is also sometimes referred to as exoprosthesis attaching an artificial limb to the bone or endoexoprosthesis the stump and socket method can cause significant pain in the amputee which is why the direct bone attachment has been explored extensively the method works by inserting a titanium bolt into the bone at the end of the stump after several months the bone attaches itself to the titanium bolt and an abutment is attached to the titanium bolt the abutment extends out of the stump and the removable artificial limb is then attached to the abutment some of the benefits of this method include the following the main disadvantage of this method is that amputees with the direct bone attachment cannot have large impacts on the limb such as those experienced during jogging because of the potential for the bone to break  cosmetic prosthesis has long been used to disguise injuries and disfigurements with advances in modern technology cosmesis the creation of lifelike limbs made from silicone or pvc has been made possible such prosthetics such as artificial hands can now be made to mimic the appearance of real hands complete with freckles veins hair fingerprints and even tattoos custommade cosmeses are generally more expensive costing thousands of us dollars depending on the level of detail while standard cosmeses come readymade in various sizes although they are often not as realistic as their custommade counterparts another option is the custommade silicone cover which can be made to match a persons skin tone but not details such as freckles or wrinkles cosmeses are attached to the body in any number of ways using an adhesive suction formfitting stretchable skin or a skin sleeve unlike neuromotor prostheses neurocognitive prostheses would sense or modulate neural function in order to physically reconstitute or augment cognitive processes such as executive function attention language and memory no neurocognitive prostheses are currently available but the development of implantable neurocognitive braincomputer interfaces has been proposed to help treat conditions such as stroke traumatic brain injury cerebral palsy autism and alzheimers disease  the recent field of assistive technology for cognition concerns the development of technologies to augment human cognition scheduling devices such as neuropage remind users with memory impairments when to perform certain activities such as visiting the doctor microprompting devices such as peat ablelink and guide have been used to aid users with memory and executive function problems perform activities of daily living in addition to the standard artificial limb for everyday use many amputees or congenital patients have special limbs and devices to aid in the participation of sports and recreational activities within science fiction and more recently within the scientific community there has been consideration given to using advanced prostheses to replace healthy body parts with artificial mechanisms and systems to improve function the morality and desirability of such technologies are being debated by transhumanists other ethicists and others in general      body parts such as legs arms hands feet and others can be replaced the first experiment with a healthy individual appears to have been that by the british scientist kevin warwick in 2002 an implant was interfaced directly into warwicks nervous system the electrode array which contained around a hundred electrodes was placed in the median nerve the signals produced were detailed enough that a robot arm was able to mimic the actions of warwicks own arm and provide a form of touch feedback again via the implant  the deka company of dean kamen developed the luke arm an advanced prosthesis under clinical trials in 2008  in early 2008 oscar pistorius the blade runner of south africa was briefly ruled ineligible to compete in the 2008 summer olympics because his transtibial prosthesis limbs were said to give him an unfair advantage over runners who had ankles one researcher found that his limbs used twentyfive percent less energy than those of an ablebodied runner moving at the same speed this ruling was overturned on appeal with the appellate court stating that the overall set of advantages and disadvantages of pistorius limbs had not been considered pistorius did not qualify for the south african team for the olympics but went on to sweep the 2008 summer paralympics and has been ruled eligible to qualify for any future olympics he qualified for the 2011 world championship in south korea and reached the semifinal where he ended last timewise he was 14th in the first round his personal best at 400m would have given him 5th place in the finals at the 2012 summer olympics in london pistorius became the first amputee runner to compete at an olympic games  he ran in the 400metres race semifinals    and the 4400metres relay race finals  he also competed in 5 events in the 2012 summer paralympics in london  in november 2012 new artificial muscles made from nanotech yarns and infused with paraffin wax were shown to lift more than 100000 times their own weight and generate 85 times more mechanical power than the natural muscle of the same dimensions according to scientists science daily science there are multiple factors to consider when designing a transtibial prosthesis manufacturers must make choices about their priorities regarding these factors nonetheless there are certain elements of socket and foot mechanics that are invaluable for the athlete and these are the focus of todays hightech prosthetics companies the buyer is also concerned with numerous other factors a typical prosthetic limb costs anywhere between 15000 and 90000 depending on the type of limb desired by the patient with medical insurance a patient will typically pay 1050 of the total cost of a prosthetic limb while the insurance company will cover the rest of the cost the percent that the patient pays varies on the type of insurance plan as well as the limb requested by the patient  transradial below the elbow amputation and transtibial prostheses below the knee amputation typically cost between us 6000 and 8000 while transfemoral above the knee amputation and transhumeral prosthetics above the elbow amputation cost approximately twice as much with a range of 10000 to 15000 and can sometimes reach costs of 35000 the cost of an artificial limb often recurs while a limb typically needs to be replaced every 34 years due to wear and tear of everyday use in addition if the socket has fit issues the socket must be replaced within several months from the onset of pain if height is an issue components such as pylons can be changed    not only does the patient need to pay for their multiple prosthetic limbs but they also need to pay for physical and occupational therapy that come along with adapting to living with an artificial limb unlike the reoccurring cost of the prosthetic limbs the patient will typically only pay the 2000 to 5000 for therapy during the first year or two of living as an amputee once the patient is strong and comfortable with their new limb they will not be required to go to therapy anymore throughout ones life it is projected that a typical amputee will go through 14 million worth of treatment including surgeries prosthetics as well as therapies   lowcost aboveknee prostheses often provide only basic structural support with limited function this function is often achieved with crude nonarticulating unstable or manually locking knee joints a limited number of organizations such as the international committee of the red cross icrc create devices for developing countries their device which is manufactured by cr equipments is a singleaxis manually operated locking polymer prosthetic knee joint  table list of knee joint technologies based on the literature review  evidence a plan for a lowcost artificial leg designed by sbastien dubois was featured at the 2007 international design exhibition and award show in copenhagen denmark where it won the index award it would be able to create an energyreturn prosthetic leg for us 800 composed primarily of fiberglass  prior to the 1980s foot prostheses merely restored basic walking capabilities these early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting ones residual limb to the ground the introduction of the seattle foot seattle limb systems in 1981 revolutionized the field bringing the concept of an energy storing prosthetic foot espf to the fore other companies soon followed suit and before long there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel the heel is compressed during initial ground contact storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward since then the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady small improvements in performance comfort and marketability with 3d printers it is possible to manufacture a single product without having to have metal molds so the costs can be drastically reduced  jaipur foot an artificial limb from jaipur india costs about us40 there is currently an open design prosthetics forum known as the open prosthetics project the group employs collaborators and volunteers to advance prosthetics technology while attempting to lower the costs of these necessary devices  another opensource prosthetics design forum is called patch project this forum is specially focused on the development of prosthetics and tools for children in developing countries the website is focused on storing and spreading information and improving development of opensource lowcost solutions  open \u03b2ionics is a company that is developing opensource robotic prosthetic hands it uses 3d printing to manufacture the devices and lowcost 3d scanners to fit them with the aim of lowering the cost of fabricating custom prosthetics  in the usa an estimate was found of 32500 children 21 years that suffer from major paediatric amputation with 5525 new cases each year of which 3315 congenital  carr et al 1998 investigated amputations caused by landmines for afghanistan bosnia and herzegovina cambodia and mozambique among children 14 years showing estimates of respectively 47 019 111 and 067 per 1000 children  mohan 1986 indicated in india a total of 424000 amputees 23500 annually of which 103 had an onset of disability below the age of 14 amounting to a total of about 43700 limb deficient children in india alone  few lowcost solutions have been created specially for children underneath some of them can be found this handheld pole with leather support band or platform for the limb is one of the simplest and cheapest solutions found it serves well as a shortterm solution but is prone to rapid contracture formation if the limb is not stretched daily through a series of rangeof motion rom sets   this also fairly simple solution comprises a plaster socket with a bamboo or pvc pipe at the bottom optionally attached to a prosthetic foot this solution prevents contractures because the knee is moved through its full rom the david werner collection an online database for the assistance of disabled village children displays manuals of production of these solutions   this solution is built using a bicycle seat post up side down as foot generating flexibility and length adjustability it is a very cheap solution using locally available materials  it is an endoskeletal modular lower limb from india which uses thermoplastic parts its main advantages are the small weight and adaptability  monolimbs are nonmodular prostheses and thus require more experienced prosthetist for correct fitting because alignment can barely be changed after production however their durability on average is better than lowcost modular solutions

V smoking is a practice in which a substance is burned and the resulting smoke breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream most commonly the substance is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant which have been rolled into a small square of rice paper to create a small round cylinder called a cigarette smoking is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue in the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gasses and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid nicotine the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas to form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs in some cultures smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals where participants use it to help induce trancelike states that they believe can lead them to spiritual enlightenment cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be handrolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper other smoking implements include pipes cigars bidis hookahs vaporizers and bongs smoking generally has adverse health effects because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by nonsmokers a 2007 report states that each year about 49 million people worldwide die as a result of smoking  smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use tobacco smoking is the most popular form being practiced by over one billion people globally of whom the majority are in the developing world  less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics like heroin but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available the history of smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 bc and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies as offerings to deities in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for purposes of divination or spiritual enlightenment after the european exploration and conquest of the americas the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world in regions like india and subsaharan africa it merged with existing practices of smoking mostly of cannabis in europe it introduced a new type of social activity and a form of drug intake which previously had been unknown perception surrounding smoking has varied over time and from one place to another holy and sinful sophisticated and vulgar a panacea and deadly health hazard in the 20th century smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light especially in western countries this is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer heart attacks copd erectile dysfunction and birth defects  the health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products run ads to discourage use limit ads that promote use and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke    the history of smoking dates back to as early as 5000 bc in shamanistic rituals  many ancient civilizations such as the babylonians indians and chinese burnt incense as a part of religious rituals as did the israelites and the later catholic and orthodox christian churches smoking in the americas probably had its origins in the incenseburning ceremonies of shamans but was later adopted for pleasure or as a social tool  the smoking of tobacco as well as various hallucinogenic drugs was used to achieve trances and to come into contact with the spirit world substances such as cannabis clarified butter ghee fish offal dried snake skins and various pastes molded around incense sticks dates back at least 2000years fumigation dhupa and fire offerings homa are prescribed in the ayurveda for medical purposes and have been practiced for at least 3000years while smoking dhumrapana literally drinking smoke has been practiced for at least 2000years before modern times these substances have been consumed through pipes with stems of various lengths or chillums  cannabis smoking was common in the middle east before the arrival of tobacco and was early on a common social activity that centered around the type of water pipe called a hookah smoking especially after the introduction of tobacco was an essential component of muslim society and culture and became integrated with important traditions such as weddings funerals and was expressed in architecture clothing literature and poetry  cannabis smoking was introduced to subsaharan africa through ethiopia and the east african coast by either indian or arab traders in the 13th century or earlier and spread on the same trade routes as those that carried coffee which originated in the highlands of ethiopia  it was smoked in calabash water pipes with terra cotta smoking bowls apparently an ethiopian invention which was later conveyed to eastern southern and central africa reports from the first european explorers and conquistadors to reach the americas tell of rituals where native priests smoked themselves into such high degrees of intoxication that it is unlikely that the rituals were limited to just tobacco  in 1612 six years after the settlement of jamestown john rolfe was credited as the first settler to successfully raise tobacco as a cash crop the demand quickly grew as tobacco referred to as golden weed revived the virginia join stock company from its failed gold expeditions  in order to meet demands from the old world tobacco was grown in succession quickly depleting the land this became a motivator to settle west into the unknown continent and likewise an expansion of tobacco production  indentured servitude became the primary labor force up until bacons rebellion from which the focus turned to slavery  this trend abated following the american revolution as slavery became regarded as unprofitable however the practice was revived in 1794 with the invention of the cotton gin  a frenchman named jean nicot from whose name the word nicotine is derived introduced tobacco to france in 1560 from france tobacco spread to england the first report of a smoking englishman is of a sailor in bristol in 1556 seen emitting smoke from his nostrils  like tea coffee and opium tobacco was just one of many intoxicants that was originally used as a form of medicine  tobacco was introduced around 1600 by french merchants in what today is modernday gambia and senegal at the same time caravans from morocco brought tobacco to the areas around timbuktu and the portuguese brought the commodity and the plant to southern africa establishing the popularity of tobacco throughout all of africa by the 1650s soon after its introduction to the old world tobacco came under frequent criticism from state and religious leaders murad iv sultan of the ottoman empire 162340 was among the first to attempt a smoking ban by claiming it was a threat to public morality and health the chongzhen emperor of china issued an edict banning smoking two years before his death and the overthrow of the ming dynasty later the manchu rulers of the qing dynasty would proclaim smoking a more heinous crime than that even of neglecting archery in edo period japan some of the earliest tobacco plantations were scorned by the shogunate as being a threat to the military economy by letting valuable farmland go to waste for the use of a recreational drug instead of being used to plant food crops  religious leaders have often been prominent among those who considered smoking immoral or outright blasphemous in 1634 the patriarch of moscow forbade the sale of tobacco and sentenced men and women who flouted the ban to have their nostrils slit and their backs whipped until skin came off their backs the western church leader urban vii likewise condemned smoking in a papal bull of 1590 despite many concerted efforts restrictions and bans were almost universally ignored when james i of england a staunch antismoker and the author of a counterblaste to tobacco tried to curb the new trend by enforcing a whopping 4000 tax increase on tobacco in 1604 it proved a failure as london had some 7000 tobacco sellers by the early 17th century later scrupulous rulers would realise the futility of smoking bans and instead turned tobacco trade and cultivation into lucrative government monopolies  by the mid17th century every major civilization had been introduced to tobacco smoking and in many cases had already assimilated it into its culture despite the attempts of many rulers to stamp the practice out with harsh penalties or fines tobacco both product and plant followed the major trade routes to major ports and markets and then on into the hinterlands the english language term smoking was coined in the late 18th century before then the practice was referred to as drinking smoke  tobacco and cannabis were used in subsaharan africa much like elsewhere in the world to confirm social relations but also created entirely new ones in what is today congo a society called bena diemba people of cannabis was organized in the late 19th century in lubuko the land of friendship the bena diemba were collectivist pacifists that rejected alcohol and herbal medicines in favor of cannabis  the growth remained stable until the american civil war in 1860s from which the primary labor force transition from slavery to share cropping this compounded with a change in demand lead to the industrialization of tobacco production with the cigarette james bonsack a craftsman in 1881 produced a machine to speed the production of cigarettes  in the 19th century the practice of smoking opium became common previously it had only been eaten and then primarily for its medical properties a massive increase in opium smoking in china was more or less directly instigated by the british trade deficit with qing dynasty china as a way to amend this problem the british began exporting large amounts of opium grown in the indian colonies the social problems and the large net loss of currency led to several chinese attempts to stop the imports which eventually culminated in the first and second opium wars  opium smoking later spread with chinese immigrants and spawned many infamous opium dens in china towns around south and southeast asia and europe in the latter half of the 19th century opium smoking became popular in the artistic community in europe especially paris artists neighborhoods such as montparnasse and montmartre became virtual opium capitals while opium dens that catered primarily to emigrant chinese continued to exist in china towns around the world the trend among the european artists largely abated after the outbreak of world war i  the consumption of opium abated in china during the cultural revolution in the 1960s and 1970s with the modernization of cigarette production compounded with the increased life expectancies during the 1920s adverse health effects began to become more prevalent  in germany antismoking groups often associated with antiliquor groups  first published advocacy against the consumption of tobacco in the journal der tabakgegner the tobacco opponent in 1912 and 1932 in 1929 fritz lickint of dresden germany published a paper containing formal statistical evidence of a lung cancertobacco link during the great depression adolf hitler condemned his earlier smoking habit as a waste of money  and later with stronger assertions this movement was further strengthened with nazi reproductive policy as women who smoked were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a german family  the movement in nazi germany did reach across enemy lines during the second world war as antismoking groups quickly lost popular support  by the end of the second world war american cigarette manufacturers quickly reentered the german black market illegal smuggling of tobacco became prevalent  and leaders of the nazi antismoking campaign were assassinated  as part of the marshall plan the united states shipped free tobacco to germany with 24000 tons in 1948 and 69000tons in 1949  per capita yearly cigarette consumption in postwar germany steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1523 in 1963  by the end of the 20th century antismoking campaigns in germany were unable to exceed the effectiveness of the naziera climax in the years 193941 and german tobacco health research was described by robert n proctor as muted  in the uk and the usa an increase in lung cancer rates formerly among the rarest forms of disease was noted by the 1930s but its cause remained unknown and even the credibility of this increase was sometimes disputed as late as 1950 for example in connecticut reported ageadjusted incidence rates of lung cancer among males increased 220 between 193539 and 195054 in the uk the share of lung cancer among all cancer deaths in men increased from 15 in 1920 to 197 in 1947 nevertheless these increases were questioned as potentially caused by increased reporting and improved methods of diagnosis although several carcinogens were already known at the time for example benzoapyrene was isolated from coal tar and demonstrated to be a potent carcinogen in 1933 none were known to be contained in adequate quantities in tobacco smoke  richard doll in 1950 published research in the british medical journal showing a close link between smoking and lung cancer  four years later in 1954 the british doctors study a study of some 40 thousand doctors over 20 years confirmed the link based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related   in 1964 the united states surgeon generals report on smoking and health demonstrated the relationship between smoking and cancer  further reports confirmed this link in the 1980s and concluded in 1986 that passive smoking was also harmful  as scientific evidence mounted in the 1980s tobacco companies claimed contributory negligence as the adverse health effects were previously unknown or lacked substantial credibility health authorities sided with these claims up until 1998 from which they reversed their position the tobacco master settlement agreement originally between the four largest us tobacco companies and the attorneys general of 46 states restricted certain types of tobacco advertisement and required payments for health compensation which later amounted to the largest civil settlement in united states history  from 1965 to 2006 rates of smoking in the united states have declined from 42 to 208  a significant majority of those who quit were professional affluent men despite this decrease in the prevalence of consumption the average number of cigarettes consumed per person per day increased from 22 in 1954 to 30 in 1978 this paradoxical event suggests that those who quit smoked less while those who continued to smoke moved to smoke more light cigarettes  this trend has been paralleled by many industrialized nations as rates have either leveledoff or declined in the developing world however tobacco consumption continues to rise at 34 in 2002  in africa smoking is in most areas considered to be modern and many of the strong adverse opinions that prevail in the west receive much less attention  today russia leads as the top consumer of tobacco followed by indonesia laos ukraine belarus greece jordan and china  the world health organization has begun a program known as the tobacco free initiative tfi in order to reduce rates of consumption in the developing world in the early 1980s organized international drug trafficking grew however compounded with overproduction and tighter legal enforcement for the illegal product drug dealers decided to convert the powder to crack  a solid smokeable form of cocaine that could be sold in smaller quantities to more people  this trend abated in the 1990s as increased police action coupled with a robust economy deterred many potential candidates to forfeit or fail to take up the habit  recent years shows an increase in the consumption of vaporized heroin methamphetamine and phencyclidine pcp along with a smaller number of psychedelic drugs such as dmt 5meodmt and salvia divinorum  the most popular type of substance that is smoked is tobacco there are many different tobacco cultivars which are made into a wide variety of mixtures and brands tobacco is often sold flavored often with various fruit aromas something which is especially popular for use with water pipes such as hookahs the second most common substance that is smoked is cannabis made from the flowers or leaves of cannabis sativa or cannabis indica the substance is considered illegal in most countries in the world and in those countries that tolerate public consumption it is usually only pseudolegal despite this a considerable percentage of the adult population in many countries have tried it with smaller minorities doing it on a regular basis since cannabis is illegal or only tolerated in most jurisdictions there is no industrial massproduction of cigarettes meaning that the most common form of smoking is with handrolled cigarettes often called joints or with pipes water pipes are also fairly common and when used for cannabis are called bongs a few other recreational drugs are smoked by smaller minorities most of these substances are controlled and some are considerably more intoxicating than either tobacco or cannabis these include crack cocaine heroin methamphetamine and pcp a small number of psychedelic drugs are also smoked including dmt 5meodmt and salvia divinorum even the most primitive form of smoking requires tools of some sort to perform this has resulted in a staggering variety of smoking tools and paraphernalia from all over the world whether tobacco cannabis opium or herbs some form of receptacle is required along with a source of fire to light the mixture the most common today is by far the cigarette consisting of a mild inhalant strain of tobacco in a tightly rolled tube of paper usually manufactured industrially and including a filter or handrolled with loose tobacco other popular smoking tools are various pipes and cigars a less common but increasingly popular alternative to smoking is vaporizers which use hot air convection to deliver the substance without combustion thereby decreasing health risk to the lungs a portable vaporization alternative appeared in 2003 with the introduction of electronic cigarettes batteryoperated cigaretteshaped devices which produce an aerosol intended to mimic the smoke from burning tobacco delivering nicotine to the user without carbon monoxide and other harmful substances released in tobacco smoke claims that electronic cigarettes are overall less harmful to use than real cigarettes are however disputed  as is their legal status in many countries other than actual smoking equipment many other items are associated with smoking cigarette cases cigar boxes lighters matchboxes cigarette holders cigar holders ashtrays silent butlers pipe cleaners tobacco cutters match stands pipe tampers cigarette companions and so on many of these have become valuable collector items and particularly ornate and antique items can fetch high prices at the finest auction houses smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death globally in the united states about 500000 deaths per year are attributed to smokingrelated diseases and a recent study estimated that as much as 13 of chinas male population will have significantly shortened lifespans due to smoking  male and female smokers lose an average of 132 and 145 years of life respectively  at least half of all lifelong smokers die earlier as a result of smoking   the risk of dying from lung cancer before age 85 is 221 for a male smoker and 119 for a female current smoker in the absence of competing causes of death the corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 11 probability of dying from lung cancer before age 85 for a man of european descent and a 08 probability for a woman  smoking one cigarette a day results in a risk of heart disease that is halfway between that of a smoker and a nonsmoker the nonlinear dose response relationship is explained by smokings effect on platelet aggregation  among the diseases that can be caused by smoking are vascular stenosis lung cancer  heart attacks  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  smoking during pregnancy may cause adhd to a fetus  many governments are trying to deter people from smoking with antismoking campaigns in mass media stressing the harmful longterm effects of smoking passive smoking or secondhand smoking which affects people in the immediate vicinity of smokers is a major reason for the enforcement of smoking bans this is a law enforced to stop individuals smoking in indoor public places such as bars pubs and restaurants the idea behind this is to discourage smoking by making it more inconvenient and to stop harmful smoke being present in enclosed public spaces a common concern among legislators is to discourage smoking among minors and many states have passed laws against selling tobacco products to underage customers establishing a smoking age many developing countries have not adopted antismoking policies leading some to call for antismoking campaigns and further education to explain the negative effects of ets environmental tobacco smoke in developing countries  tobacco advertising is also sometimes regulated to make smoking less appealing despite the many bans european countries still hold 18 of the top 20 spots and according to the erc a market research company the heaviest smokers are from greece averaging 3000 cigarettes per person in 2007  rates of smoking have leveled off or declined in the developed world but continue to rise in developing countries smoking rates in the united states have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006 falling from 42 to 208 in adults  the effects of addiction on society vary considerably between different substances that can be smoked and the indirect social problems that they cause in great part because of the differences in legislation and the enforcement of narcotics legislation around the world though nicotine is a highly addictive drug its effects on cognition are not as intense or noticeable as other drugs such as cocaine amphetamines or any of the opiates including heroin and morphine  smoking is a risk factor in alzheimers disease  while smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day has been shown to worsen the symptoms of crohns disease  smoking has been shown to actually lower the prevalence of ulcerative colitis   inhaling the vaporized gas form of substances into the lungs is a quick and very effective way of delivering drugs into the bloodstream as the gas diffuses directly into the pulmonary vein then into the heart and from there to the brain and affects the user within less than a second of the first inhalation the lungs consist of several million tiny bulbs called alveoli that altogether have an area of over 70 m about the area of a tennis court this can be used to administer useful medical as well as recreational drugs such as aerosols consisting of tiny droplets of a medication or as gas produced by burning plant material with a psychoactive substance or pure forms of the substance itself not all drugs can be smoked for example the sulphate derivative that is most commonly inhaled through the nose though purer free base forms of substances can but often require considerable skill in administering the drug properly the method is also somewhat inefficient since not all of the smoke will be inhaled  the inhaled substances trigger chemical reactions in nerve endings in the brain due to being similar to naturally occurring substances such as endorphins and dopamine which are associated with sensations of pleasure the result is what is usually referred to as a high that ranges between the mild stimulus caused by nicotine to the intense euphoria caused by heroin cocaine and methamphetamines  inhaling smoke into the lungs no matter the substance has adverse effects on ones health  the incomplete combustion produced by burning plant material like tobacco or cannabis produces carbon monoxide which impairs the ability of blood to carry oxygen when inhaled into the lungs there are several other toxic compounds in tobacco that constitute serious health hazards to longterm smokers from a whole range of causes vascular abnormalities such as stenosis lung cancer heart attacks strokes impotence low birth weight of infants born by smoking mothers 8 of longterm smokers develop the characteristic set of facial changes known to doctors as smokers face  tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of over 5000 identified chemicals of which 98 are known to have specific toxicological properties  the most important chemicals causing cancer are those that produce dna damage since such damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer   cunningham et al  combined the microgram weight of the compound in the smoke of one cigarette with the known genotoxic effect per microgram to identify the most carcinogenic compounds in cigarette smoke the seven most important carcinogens in tobacco smoke are shown in the table along with dna alterations they cause most tobacco smokers begin during adolescence or early adulthood smoking has elements of risktaking and rebellion which often appeal to young people the presence of highstatus models and peers may also encourage smoking because teenagers are influenced more by their peers than by adults  attempts by parents schools and health professionals at preventing people from trying cigarettes are not always successful smokers often report that cigarettes help relieve feelings of stress however the stress levels of adult smokers are slightly higher than those of nonsmokers adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking and smoking cessation leads to reduced stress far from acting as an aid for mood control nicotine dependency seems to exacerbate stress this is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes thus the apparent relaxant effect of smoking only reflects the reversal of the tension and irritability that develop during nicotine depletion dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal  in the mid20th century psychologists such as hans eysenck developed a personality profile for the typical smoker of that period extraversion was associated with smoking and smokers tended to be sociable impulsive risk taking and excitementseeking individuals  although personality and social factors may make people likely to smoke the actual habit is a function of operant conditioning during the early stages smoking provides pleasurable sensations because of its action on the dopamine system and thus serves as a source of positive reinforcement after an individual has smoked for many years the avoidance of withdrawal symptoms and negative reinforcement become the key motivations like all addictive substances the amount of exposure required to become dependent on nicotine can vary from person to person education and counselling by physicians of children and adolescents has been found to be effective in decreasing the risk of tobacco use  smoking primarily of tobacco is an activity that is practiced by some 11billion people and up to 13 of the adult population  the image of the smoker can vary considerably but is very often associated especially in fiction with individuality and aloofness even so smoking of both tobacco and cannabis can be a social activity which serves as a reinforcement of social structures and is part of the cultural rituals of many and diverse social and ethnic groups many smokers begin smoking in social settings and the offering and sharing of a cigarette is often an important rite of initiation or simply a good excuse to start a conversation with strangers in many settings in bars night clubs at work or on the street lighting a cigarette is often seen as an effective way of avoiding the appearance of idleness or mere loitering for adolescents it can function as a first step out of childhood or as an act of rebellion against the adult world also smoking can be seen as a sort of camaraderie it has been shown that even opening a packet of cigarettes or offering a cigarette to other people can increase the level of dopamine the happy feeling in the brain and it is doubtless that people who smoke form relationships with fellow smokers in a way that only proliferates the habit particularly in countries where smoking inside public places has been made illegal  other than recreational drug use it can be used to construct identity and a development of selfimage by associating it with personal experiences connected with smoking the rise of the modern antismoking movement in the late 19th century did more than create awareness of the hazards of smoking it provoked reactions of smokers against what was and often still is perceived as an assault on personal freedom and has created an identity among smokers as rebels or outcasts apart from nonsmokers the importance of tobacco to soldiers was early on recognized as something that could not be ignored by commanders by the 17th century allowances of tobacco were a standard part of the naval rations of many nations and by world war i cigarette manufacturers and governments collaborated in securing tobacco and cigarette allowances to soldiers in the field it was asserted that regular use of tobacco while under duress would not only calm the soldiers but allow them to withstand greater hardship  until the mid20th century the majority of the adult population in many western nations were smokers and the claims of antismoking activists were met with much skepticism if not outright contempt today the movement has considerably more weight and evidence of its claims but a considerable proportion of the population remains steadfast smokers  smoking has been accepted into culture in various art forms and has developed many distinct and often conflicting or mutually exclusive meanings depending on time place and the practitioners of smoking pipe smoking until recently one of the most common forms of smoking is today often associated with solemn contemplation old age and is often considered quaint and archaic  cigarette smoking which did not begin to become widespread until the late 19th century has more associations of modernity and the faster pace of the industrialized world cigars have been and still are associated with masculinity power and is an iconic image associated with the stereotypical capitalist in fact some evidence suggests that men with higher than average testosterone levels are more likely to smoke  smoking in public has for a long time been something reserved for men and when done by women has been associated with promiscuity in japan during the edo period prostitutes and their clients would often approach one another under the guise of offering a smoke the same was true for 19thcentury europe  the earliest depictions of smoking can be found on classical mayan pottery from around the 9th century the art was primarily religious in nature and depicted deities or rulers smoking early forms of cigarettes  soon after smoking was introduced outside of the americas it began appearing in painting in europe and asia the painters of the dutch golden age were among the first to paint portraits of people smoking and still lifes of pipes and tobacco for southern european painters of the 17th century a pipe was much too modern to include in the preferred motifs inspired by mythology from greek and roman antiquity at first smoking was considered lowly and was associated with peasants  many early paintings were of scenes set in taverns or brothels later as the dutch republic rose to considerable power and wealth smoking became more common amongst the affluent and portraits of elegant gentlemen tastefully raising a pipe appeared smoking represented pleasure transience and the briefness of earthly life as it quite literally went up in smoke smoking was also associated with representations of both the sense of smell and that of taste in the 18th century smoking became far more sparse in painting as the elegant practice of taking snuff became popular smoking a pipe was again relegated to portraits of lowly commoners and country folk and the refined sniffing of shredded tobacco followed by sneezing was rare in art when smoking appeared it was often in the exotic portraits influenced by orientalism many proponents of postcolonial theory controversially believe this portrayal was a means of projecting an image of european superiority over its colonies and a perception of the male dominance of a feminized orient proponents believe the theme of the exotic and alien other escalated in the 19th century fueled by the rise in the popularity of ethnology during the enlightenment  in the 19th century smoking was common as a symbol of simple pleasures the pipe smoking noble savage solemn contemplation by classical roman ruins scenes of an artists becoming one with nature while slowly toking a pipe the newly empowered middle class also found a new dimension of smoking as a harmless pleasure enjoyed in smoking saloons and libraries smoking a cigarette or a cigar would also become associated with the bohemian someone who shunned the conservative middle class values and displayed his contempt for conservatism but this was a pleasure that was to be confined to a male world women smokers were associated with prostitution and smoking was not considered an activity fit for proper ladies  it was not until the start of the 20th century that smoking women would appear in paintings and photos giving a chic and charming impression impressionists like vincent van gogh who was a pipe smoker himself would also begin to associate smoking with gloom and findusicle fatalism while the symbolism of the cigarette pipe and cigar respectively were consolidated in the late 19th century it was not until the 20th century that artists began to use it fully a pipe would stand for thoughtfulness and calm the cigarette symbolized modernity strength and youth but also nervous anxiety the cigar was a sign of authority wealth and power the decades following world war ii during the apex of smoking when the practice had still not come under fire by the growing antismoking movement a cigarette casually tucked between the lips represented the young rebel epitomized in actors like marlon brando and james dean or mainstays of advertising like the marlboro man it was not until the 1970s when the negative aspects of smoking began to appear yielding the image of the unhealthy lowerclass individual reeking of cigarette smoke and lack of motivation and drive which was especially prominent in art inspired or commissioned by antismoking campaigns  in his painting holy smokes artist brian whelan pokes fun at the smoking debate and its newly found focus on morality and guilt ever since the era of silent films smoking has had a major part in film symbolism in the hard boiled film noir crime thrillers cigarette smoke often frames characters and is frequently used to add an aura of mystique or nihilism one of the forerunners of this symbolism can be seen in fritz langs weimar era dr mabuse der spieler 1922 dr mabuse the gambler where men mesmerized by card playing smoke cigarettes while gambling female smokers in film were also early on associated with a type of sensuous and seductive sexuality most notably personified by german film star marlene dietrich similarly actors like humphrey bogart and audrey hepburn have been closely identified with their smoker persona and some of their most famous portraits and roles have involved them being haloed by a mist of cigarette smoke hepburn often enhanced the glamour with a cigarette holder most notably in the film breakfast at tiffanys smoking could also be used as a means to subvert censorship as two cigarettes burning unattended in an ashtray were often used to suggest sexual activity since world war ii smoking has gradually become less frequent on screen as the obvious health hazards of smoking have become more widely known with the antismoking movement gaining greater respect and influence conscious attempts not to show smoking on screen are now undertaken in order to avoid encouraging smoking or giving it positive associations particularly for family films smoking on screen is more common today among characters who are portrayed as antisocial or even criminal  just as in other types of fiction smoking has had an important place in literature and smokers are often portrayed as characters with great individuality or outright eccentrics something typically personified in one of the most iconic smoking literary figures of all sherlock holmes other than being a frequent part of short stories and novels smoking has spawned endless eulogies praising its qualities and affirming the authors identity as a devoted smoker especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century a panoply of books with titles like tobacco its history and associations 1876 cigarettes in fact and fancy 1906 and pipe and pouch the smokers own book of poetry 1905 were written in the uk and the us the titles were written by men for other men and contained general tidbits and poetic musings about the love for tobacco and all things related to it and frequently praised the refined bachelors life the fragrant weed some of the good things which have been said or sung about tobacco published in 1907 contained among many others the following lines from the poem a bachelors views by tom hall that were typical of the attitude in many of the books these works were all published in an era before the cigarette had become the dominant form of tobacco consumption and pipes cigars and chewing tobacco were still commonplace many of the books were published in novel packaging that would attract the learned smoking gentleman pipe and pouch came in a leather bag resembling a tobacco pouch and cigarettes in fact and fancy 1901 came bound in leather packaged in an imitation cardboard cigar box by the late 1920s the publication of this type of literature largely abated and was only sporadically revived in the later 20th century  there have been few examples of tobacco in music in early modern times though there are occasional signs of influence in pieces such as johann sebastian bachs edifying thoughts of a tobaccosmoker  however from the early 20th century and onwards smoking has been closely associated with popular music jazz was from early on closely intertwined with the smoking that was practiced in the venues where it was played such as bars dance halls jazz clubs and even brothels the rise of jazz coincided with the expansion of the modern tobacco industry and in the united states also contributed to the spread of cannabis the latter went under names like tea muggles and reefer in the jazz community and was so influential in the 1920s and 30s that it found its way into songs composed at the time such as louis armstrongs muggles larry adlers smoking reefers and don redmans chant of the weed the popularity of marijuana among jazz musicians remained high until the 1940s and 50s when it was partially replaced by the use of heroin  another form of modern popular music that has been closely associated with cannabis smoking is reggae a style of music that originated in jamaica in the late 1950s and early 60s cannabis or ganja is believed to have been introduced to jamaica in the mid19th century by indian immigrant labor and was primarily associated with indian workers until it was appropriated by the rastafari movement in the middle of the 20th century  the rastafari considered cannabis smoking to be a way to come closer to god or jah an association that was greatly popularized by reggae icons such as bob marley and peter tosh in the 1960s and 70s  estimates claim that smokers cost the us economy 976 billion a year in lost productivity and that an additional 967 billion is spent on public and private health care combined  this is over 1 of the gross domestic product a male smoker in the united states that smokes more than one pack a day can expect an average increase of 19000 just in medical expenses over the course of his lifetime a us female smoker that also smokes more than a pack a day can expect an average of 25800 additional healthcare costs over her lifetime

V thinfilm drug delivery uses a dissolving film or oral drug strip to administer drugs via absorption in the mouth buccally or sublingually andor via the small intestines enterically a film is prepared using hydrophilic polymers that rapidly dissolves on the tongue or buccal cavity delivering the drug to the systemic circulation via dissolution when contact with liquid is made prolific inventors in thin film drug delivery include richard fuisz joseph fuisz garry myers and robert yang  this group has contributed over thirty patents in this field thinfilm drug delivery has emerged as an advanced alternative to the traditional tablets capsules and liquids often associated with prescription and otc medications similar in size shape and thickness to a postage stamp thinfilm strips are typically designed for oral administration with the user placing the strip on or under the tongue sublingual or along the inside of the cheek buccal these drug delivery options allow the medication to bypass the first pass metabolism thereby making the medication more bioavailable  as the strip dissolves the drug can enter the blood stream enterically buccally or sublingually evaluating the systemic transmucosal drug delivery the buccal mucosa is the preferred region as compared to the sublingual mucosa different buccal delivery products have been marketed or are proposed for certain diseases like trigeminal neuralgia menieres disease diabetes and addiction  there are many commercial nondrug product to use thin films like mr mint and listerine pocketpaks breath freshening strips since then thinfilm products for other breath fresheners as well as a number of cold flu antisnoring and gastrointestinal medications have entered the marketplace there are currently  several projects in development that will deliver prescription drugs using the thinfilm dosage form  formulation of oral drug strips involves the application of both aesthetic and performance characteristics such as stripforming polymers plasticizers active pharmaceutical ingredient sweetening agents saliva stimulating agent flavoring agents coloring agents stabilizing and thickening agents from the regulatory perspectives all excipients used in the formulation of oral drug strips should be approved for use in oral pharmaceutical dosage forms   the polymer employed should be nontoxic nonirritant and devoid of leachable impurities it should have good wetting and spreadability property the polymer should exhibit sufficient peel shear and tensile strengths the polymer should be readily available and should not be very expensive film obtained should be tough enough so that there wont be any damage while handling or during transportation combination of microcrystalline cellulose and maltodextrin has been used to formulate oral strips of piroxicam made by hot melt extrusion technique pullulan has been the most widely used film former used in listerine pocketpak benadryl etc plasticizer is a vital ingredient of the os formulation it helps to improve the flexibility of the strip and reduces the brittleness of the strip plasticizer significantly improves the strip properties by reducing the glass transition temperature of the polymer glycerol propylene glycol low molecular weight polyethylene glycols phthalate derivatives like dimethyl diethyl and dibutyl phthalate citrate derivatives such as tributyl triethyl acetyl citrate triacetin and castor oil are some of the commonly used plasticizer excipients since the size of the dosage form has limitation highdose molecules are difficult to be incorporated in os generally 5ww to 30ww of active pharmaceutical ingredients can be incorporated in the oral strip  an important aspect of thin film drug technology is its taste and color the sweet taste in formulation is more important in case of pediatric population natural sweeteners as well as artificial sweeteners are used to improve the flavor of the mouth dissolving formulations for the flavors changes from individual to individual pigments such as titanium dioxide is incorporated for coloring the stabilizing and thickening agents are employed to improve the viscosity and consistency of dispersion or solution of the strip preparation solution or suspension before casting drug content uniformity is a requirement for all dosage forms particularly those containing low dose highly potent drugs to uniquely meet this requirement thin film formulations contain uniform dispersions of drug throughout the whole manufacturing process  since this criterion is essential for the quality of the thin film and final pharmaceutical dosage form the use of laser scanning confocal microscopy lscm was recommended to follow the manufacturing process  there are not yet many medications available in a thin film form on the market those that are include on july 2 2010 strativa pharmaceuticals the proprietary products division of par pharmaceutical received approval from the us fda for zuplenz ondansetron oral soluble film osf for the prevention of postoperative highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapyinduced and radiotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting   an increasing number of filmbased therapeutics are in development including the design of thin film as an oral drug delivery technology offers several advantages over other modes of drug delivery such as ingestible tablets chewable tablets orally dissolving tablets softgels liquids or inhalants

V an inhaler or puffer is a medical device used for delivering medication into the body via the lungs it is mainly used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd zanamivir relenza used to treat influenza must be administered via inhaler to reduce deposition in the mouth and throat and to reduce the need for precise synchronization of the start of inhalation with actuation of the device mdis are sometimes used with a complementary spacer or holding chamber device decongestant inhalers are popular overthecounter remedies for nasal congestion in the upper respiratory tract   the most common type of inhaler is the pressurized metereddose inhaler mdi in mdis medication is typically stored in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellant although it may also be a suspension  the mdi canister is attached to a plastic handoperated actuator on activation the metereddose inhaler releases a fixed dose of medication in aerosol form the correct procedure for using an mdi is to first fully exhale place the mouthpiece of the device into the mouth and having just started to inhale at a moderate rate depress the canister to release the medicine the aerosolized medication is drawn into the lungs by continuing to inhale deeply before holding the breath for 10 seconds to allow the aerosol to settle onto the walls of the bronchittus and other airways of the lung some inhalers are made to act instantly in case of an asthma attack and others are made to act later dry powder inhalers release a metered or devicemeasured dose of powdered medication that is inhaled through a dpi device nebulizers  supply the medication as an aerosol created from an aqueous formulation nasal inhalers contain decongestant drugs to relieve nasal congestion in the upper respiratory tract the active ingredient in most decongestants is either pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine many are sold overthecounter without a prescription1 in 2009 the fda banned the use of inhalers that utilize chlorofluorocarbons cfc as propellants for hydrofluorocarbons hfa inhalers hfa is not environmentally inert as a greenhouse gas but does not affect the ozone layer  while some asthma sufferers and advocacy groups contend that the latter are not as effective  published clinical studies indicate equivalent control of asthma is achieved with use of hfa inhalers  inhalers used to treat asthma contains dry powder spin inhalers and aerosoles containing suspending liquid medicament but in both the cases the size of suspended particles or powder particles must be less than 5 micrometres so as to increase the surface area and deliver the drug to the inner most areas such a sufficiently small size of particles is necessary for dispersion and also for rapid action while the impact of cfc of inhalers on the ozone layer had been minuscule the fda in its interpretation of the montreal protocol mandated the switch in propellants  patients expressed concern about the high price of the hfa inhalers as there is no generic version which had been available in the cfc inhalers for many years  the elimination of generics from the market led to a price increase in inhalers that is expected to cost american consumers insurances and the government about 8 billion by 2017  the idea of directly delivering medication into the lungs was introduced by julius mount bleyer in 1890  in 1968 robert wexler of abbott laboratories developed the analgizer a disposable inhaler that allowed the selfadministration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia  the analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece the device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane because of the simplicity of the analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane it was easy for patients to selfadminister the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours the 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain the device could be refilled if necessary  the analgizer was found to be safe effective and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations  and for dressing changes on burn patients  when used for labor analgesia the analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on apgar scores  all vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients newborns and injured patients  the analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s in a manner that foreshadowed the patientcontrolled analgesia infusion pumps of today     the analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974 but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in australia and new zealand in the form of the penthrox inhaler       the largest manufacturers of inhalers are cipla glaxosmithkline makers of the advair discus a dpi midascare pharmaceuticals pvt ltd merck astrazeneca makers of pulmicort and symbicort and boehringeringelheim makers of atrovent combivent and spiriva bi gsk merck and astrazeneca manufacture the medication being delivered via inhaler however 3m drug delivery systems does some of the finished product manufacturing as they are one of the leaders of mdi canisters metering valves and other components

V a relative analgesia machine is used by dentists to induce inhalation sedation in their patients it delivers a mixture of nitrous oxide laughing gas and oxygen a relative analgesia machine is simpler than an anaesthetic machine as it does not feature the additional medical ventilator and anaesthetic vaporiser which are only needed for administration of general anesthetics instead the relative analgesia machine is designed for the light form of anaesthesia with nitrous oxide where the patient is less sensitive to pain but remains fully conscious

V regulatory affairs ra also called government affairs is a profession within regulated industries such as pharmaceuticals medical devices energy banking telecom etc regulatory affairs also has a very specific meaning within the healthcare industries pharmaceuticals medical devices biologics and functional foods regulatory affairs medical affairs professionals aka regulatory professionals usually have responsibility for the following general areas   the regulatory function in healthcare industries is vital in making safe and effective healthcare products available worldwide individuals who ensure regulatory compliance and prepare submissions as well as those whose main job function is clinical affairs or quality assurance are all considered regulatory professionals regulatory professionals are employed in industry government and academia and are involved with a wide range of products including the regulatory professionals roles and responsibilities often begin in the research and development phases moving into clinical trials and extending through premarket approvals manufacturing labeling and advertising and postmarket surveillance  regulatory professionals come from diverse backgrounds most regulatory professionals have earned a bachelors degree and more than half have an advanced degree most often in a scientific or technical field in addition regulatory professionals usually have experience in other careers before transitioning into regulatory affairs although there are some university degree and graduate certificate programs in regulatory affairs and related areas experience is a key asset for regulatory professionals valuable skills include project management and organization negotiation and communication and the ability to learn from the experience of others both inside and outside the organization continuing education and professional development are critical to the regulatory professional regulatory professionals must keep up to date with regulatory policies and procedures for one or more countries as well as maintain an understanding of the scientific and technical background of healthcare products global aspects of regulatory affairs are taken up by organisations such as the drug information association dia and the international conference on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use ich the healthcare industries were the first to be significantly regulated in the modern era much of this regulation has stemmed from avoiding the repetition of disasters and has tended to be led by the usa due to size of the market and its technological lead  in the usa this regulation is largely written directly into law and codified in title 21 of the code of federal regulations  starting in 1980 the european union started to harmonize the regulation of healthcare products in the member states  the concept of regulating medicines was well established in most member countries along similar lines to the us model but many countries did not have any significant medical device regulation concurrently the eu had been developing the concept of new approach directives where only broad concepts were written into the law and the bulk of the technological detail delegated to compliance with recognized standards which are more readily updateable    the europeans took the radical approach of applying the new approach directive to medical devices and by doing so made the first significant conceptual advance in healthcare regulation for nearly 100 years the european model for medical device has largely been adopted by the global harmonization task force as the international template  many in the regulatory affairs profession believe the new approach to regulation will eventually be adopted for all healthcare products as it represents the best model for delivering new healthcare advances to market in a reasonable time with acceptable safety  regulatory affairs departments are growing within companies due to the changing resources necessary to fulfill the regulatory requirements some companies also choose to outsource or outtask regulatory affairs to external service providers regulatory affairs department is constantly evolving and growing and is the one which is least impacted during the acquisition and merger and also during recession global harmonization in standards has led to consistent approach in regulatory submissions and hence its review  the healthcare regulatory affairs profession is still an emergent profession but has three major international professional membership organizations which offer education and training professional development competence certification and codes of ethics the regulatory professional typically has a background relevant to the business in which they work ie science medicine or engineering

V deep brain stimulation dbs is a neurosurgical procedure introduced in 1987  involving the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator sometimes referred to as a brain pacemaker which sends electrical impulses through implanted electrodes to specific parts of the brain brain nucleus for the treatment of movement and affective disorders dbs in select brain regions has provided therapeutic benefits for otherwisetreatmentresistant movement and affective disorders such as parkinsons disease essential tremor dystonia chronic pain major depression and obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd  despite the long history of dbs  its underlying principles and mechanisms are still not clear   dbs directly changes brain activity in a controlled manner its effects are reversible unlike those of lesioning techniques and it is one of only a few neurosurgical methods that allow blinded studies  the food and drug administration fda approved dbs as a treatment for essential tremor in 1997  for parkinsons disease in 2002  dystonia in 2003  and ocd in 2009  dbs is also used in research studies to treat chronic pain ptsd   and has been used to treat various affective disorders including major depression neither of these applications of dbs have yet been fdaapproved while dbs has proven effective for some patients potential for serious complications and side effects exists   the deep brain stimulation system consists of three components the implanted pulse generator ipg the lead and the extension the ipg is a batterypowered neurostimulator encased in a titanium housing which sends electrical pulses to the brain to interfere with neural activity at the target site the lead is a coiled wire insulated in polyurethane with four platinum iridium electrodes and is placed in one or two different nuclei of the brain the lead is connected to the ipg by the extension an insulated wire that runs below the skin from the head down the side of the neck behind the ear to the ipg which is placed subcutaneously below the clavicle or in some cases the abdomen  the ipg can be calibrated by a neurologist nurse or trained technician to optimize symptom suppression and control sideeffects  dbs leads are placed in the brain according to the type of symptoms to be addressed for nonparkinsonian essential tremor the lead is placed in the ventrointermediate nucleus vim of the thalamus for dystonia and symptoms associated with parkinsons disease rigidity bradykinesiaakinesia and tremor the lead may be placed in either the globus pallidus internus or the subthalamic nucleus for ocd and depression to the nucleus accumbens for incessant pain to the posterior thalamic region or periaqueductal gray for parkinson plus patients to two nuclei simultaneously subthalamic nucleus and tegmental nucleus of pons with the use of two pulse generators and for epilepsy treatment to the anterion thalamic nucleus  all three components are surgically implanted inside the body lead implantation may take place under local anesthesia or with the patient under general anesthesia asleep dbs such as for dystonia a hole about 14mm in diameter is drilled in the skull and the probe electrode is inserted stereotactically during the awake procedure with local anesthesia feedback from the patient is used to determine optimal placement of the permanent electrode during the asleep procedure intraoperative mri guidance is used for direct visualization of brain tissue and device  the installation of the ipg and extension leads occurs under general anesthesia  the right side of the brain is stimulated to address symptoms on the left side of the body and vice versa parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative disease whose primary symptoms are tremor rigidity bradykinesia and postural instability  dbs does not cure parkinsons but it can help manage some of its symptoms and subsequently improve the patients quality of life  at present the procedure is used only for patients whose symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with medications or whose medications have severe sideeffects  its direct effect on the physiology of brain cells and neurotransmitters is currently debated but by sending high frequency electrical impulses into specific areas of the brain it can mitigate symptoms  andor directly diminish the sideeffects induced by parkinsonian medications  allowing a decrease in medications or making a medication regimen more tolerable there are a few sites in the brain that can be targeted to achieve differing results so each patient must be assessed individually and a site will be chosen based on their needs traditionally the two most common sites are the subthalamic nucleus stn and the globus pallidus interna gpi but other sites such as the caudal zona incerta and the pallidofugal fibers medial to the stn are being evaluated and showing promise  dbs is approved in the united states by the food and drug administration for the treatment of parkinsons  dbs carries the risks of major surgery with a complication rate related to the experience of the surgical team the major complications include hemorrhage 12 and infection 35  stimulation of the periaqueductal gray and periventricular gray for nociceptive pain and the internal capsule ventral posterolateral nucleus and ventral posteromedial nucleus for neuropathic pain has produced impressive results with some patients but results vary and appropriate patient selection is important one study  of seventeen patients with intractable cancer pain found that thirteen were virtually painfree and only four required opioid analgesics on release from hospital after the intervention most ultimately did resort to opioids usually in the last few weeks of life  dbs has also been applied for phantom limb pain  deep brain stimulation has been used in a small number of clinical trials to treat patients suffering from a severe form of treatmentresistant depression trd  a number of neuroanatomical targets have been utilised for deep brain stimulation for trd including the subgenual cingulate gyrus nucleus accumbens  ventral capsuleventral striatum inferior thalamic peduncle and the lateral habenula  a recently proposed target of dbs intervention in depression is the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle slmfb its stimulation lead to surprisingly rapid antidepressant effects in very treatment resistant patients  the small patient numbers in the early trials of deep brain stimulation for trd currently limit the selection of an optimal neuroanatomical target  there is insufficient evidence to support dbs as a therapeutic modality for depression however the procedure may be an effective treatment modality in the future  in fact beneficial results have been documented in the neurosurgical literature including a few instances in which deeply depressed patients were provided with portable stimulators for selftreatment    a systematic review of dbs for treatmentresistant depression and obsessivecompulsive disorder identified 23 casesnine for ocd seven for treatmentresistant depression and one for both it found that about half the patients did show dramatic improvement and that adverse events were generally trivial given the younger psychiatric patient population than with movements disorders  the first randomized controlled study of dbs for the treatment of treatment resistant depression targeting the ventral capsuleventral striatum area did not demonstrate a significant difference in response rates between the active and sham groups at the end of a 16week study  dbs for treatmentresistant depression can be as effective as antidepressants with good response and remission rates but adverse effects and safety must be more fully evaluated common sideeffects include wound infection perioperative headache and worseningirritable mood and increased suicidality  deep brain stimulation has been used experimentally in treating adults with severe tourette syndrome that does not respond to conventional treatment despite widely publicized early successes dbs remains a highly experimental procedure for the treatment of tourettes and more study is needed to determine whether longterm benefits outweigh the risks     the procedure is well tolerated but complications include short battery life abrupt symptom worsening upon cessation of stimulation hypomanic or manic conversion and the significant time and effort involved in optimizing stimulation parameters  as of 2006 there were five reports in patients with ts all experienced reduction in tics and the disappearance of obsessivecompulsive behaviors  the procedure is invasive and expensive and requires longterm expert care benefits for severe tourettes are not conclusive considering less robust effects of this surgery seen in the netherlands tourettes is more common in pediatric populations tending to remit in adulthood so in general this would not be a recommended procedure for use on children because diagnosis of tourettes is made based on a history of symptoms rather than analysis of neurological activity it may not always be clear how to apply dbs for a particular patient due to concern over the use of dbs in the treatment of tourette syndrome the tourette syndrome association convened a group of experts to develop recommendations guiding the use and potential clinical trials of dbs for ts  robertson reports that dbs had been used on 55 adults as of 2011 remains an experimental treatment  and should only be conducted by experienced functional neurosurgeons operating in centres which also have a dedicated tourette syndrome clinic  according to malone et al 2006 only patients with severe debilitating and treatmentrefractory illness should be considered while those with severe personality disorders and substance abuse problems should be excluded  du et al 2010 say that as an invasive therapy dbs is currently only advisable for severely affected treatmentrefractory ts adults  singer 2011 says that pending determination of patient selection criteria and the outcome of carefully controlled clinical trials a cautious approach is recommended  viswanathan a et al 2012 say that dbs should be used in patients with severe functional impairment that can not be managed medically  results of dbs in dystonia patients where positive effects often appear gradually over a period of weeks to months indicate a role of functional reorganization in at least some cases  the procedure has been tested for effectiveness in people with epilepsy that is resistant to medication  dbs may control or eliminate epileptic seizures with programmed or responsive stimulation dbs of the septal areas of patients with schizophrenia have resulted in enhanced alertness cooperation and euphoria  patients with narcolepsy and psychomotor seizures have also reportedly experienced euphoria and sexual thoughts with selfelicited dbs of the septal areas  while dbs is helpful for some patients there is also the potential for neuropsychiatric sideeffects including apathy hallucinations compulsive gambling hypersexuality cognitive dysfunction and depression however these may be temporary and related to correct placement and calibration of the stimulator and so are potentially reversible  because the brain can shift slightly during surgery there is the possibility that the electrodes can become displaced or dislodged this may cause more profound complications such as personality changes but electrode misplacement is relatively easy to identify using ct there may also be complications of surgery such as bleeding within the brain after surgery swelling of the brain tissue mild disorientation and sleepiness are normal after 24 weeks there is a followup to remove sutures turn on the neurostimulator and program it  as with all surgery there is the risk of infection and bleeding during and after a surgery the foreign object placed may be rejected by the body or calcification of the implant might take place  the exact mechanism of action of dbs is not known  there are a variety of classes of hypotheses to explain the mechanisms of dbs   deep brain stimulation represents an advance on previous treatments which involved pallidotomy ie surgical ablation of the globus pallidus or thalamotomy ie surgical ablation of the thalamus  instead a thin lead with multiple electrodes is implanted in the globus pallidus nucleus ventralis intermedius thalami vim or the subthalamic nucleus and electric pulses are used therapeutically the lead from the implant is extended to the neurostimulator under the skin in the chest area

V in medicine a stent is a tube or other device placed in the body to create a passage between two hollow spaces and stenting is the placement of a stent there is a wide variety of stents used for different purposes from expandable coronary vascular and biliary stents to simple plastic stents used to allow the flow of urine between kidney and bladder stent is also used as a verb to describe the placement of such a device particularly when a disease such as atherosclerosis has pathologically narrowed a structure such as an artery   in 2007 the new england journal of medicine published the results of a trial called courage  the trial gave recommendations about the practice of stenting in pci a heart intervention  this study was recognized as strong evidence for the need for a fieldwide change in practice    medical societies recommend that surgeons not perform stenting in the usual surgery of otherwise healthy individuals during percutaneous coronary intervention   a report by the chicago tribune also noted that the use of cardiac coronary artery stents was too high in cases where the patient was in at least stable condition and the coronary artery stents was implanted on an elective basismany times more than one is implanted in the same procedure even in the same vessel however the report was careful to note that they are indisputably still a viable therapy that often produces satisfactory results for those with acute coronary artery disease such as relief of an arterial occlusion that has caused a heart attack myocardial infarction or where there is a danger of a piece of the blockage detaching and traveling a thrombosis to occlude a vessel in the cardiopulmonary system or the brain  the origin of the word stent remains unsettled the verb form stenting was used for centuries to describe the process of stiffening garments a usage long obsolete per the oxford english dictionary and some believe this to be the origin according to the merriam webster third new international dictionary the noun evolved from the middle english verb stenten shortened from extenten meaning to stretch which in turn came from latin extentus past participle of extendere to stretch out others attribute the noun stent to jan f esser a dutch plastic surgeon who in 1916 used the word to describe a dental impression compound invented in 1856 by the english dentist charles stent 18071885 whom esser employed to craft a form for facial reconstruction the full account is described in the journal of the history of dentistry  according to the author from the use of stents compound as a support for facial tissues evolved the use of a stent to hold open various bodily structures the first self expanding stents used in medical practice in 1986 by ulrich sigwart in lausanne were initially called wallstents julio palmaz et al created a balloon expandable stent that is currently used  the first use of a coronary stent is typically attributed to jacques puel and ulrich sigwart when they implanted a stent into a patient in toulouse france in 1986  it was used as a scaffold to prevent the vessel from closing and to avoid restenosis in coronary surgerya condition where scar tissue grows within the stent and interferes with vascular flow shortly thereafter in 1987 julio palmaz known for patenting a balloonexpandable stent and richard schatz implanted their similar stent into a patient in germany the use of these baremetal stents helped reduce the incident of restenosis from 3040 in coronary surgery to 2030 though many doctors have created the stent the first fda approved stent was invented by cesar gianturco and gary s roubin  to further reduce the incidence of restenosis drugeluting stents des were introduced which consisted of stents coated in anti proliferative agents animal studies and later clinical trials showed a reduction in restenosis to approximately 5

V an inferior vena cava filter ivc filter is a type of vascular filter a medical device that is implanted by interventional radiologists or vascular surgeons into the inferior vena cava to presumably prevent lifethreatening pulmonary emboli pes  their effectiveness and safety profile is not well established and in general they are only recommended in some highrisk scenarios  they are not intended to be a replacement for medical drugbased management of venous thromboembolism vte however in cases where patients are at high risk of developing a clinically significant pe and cannot be sufficiently anticoagulated placement of an ivc filter may be recommended  to date there has been only one randomized controlled trial completed on ivc filters this study found that ivc filters reduced the incidence of pe but increased the incidence of deep vein thrombosis dvt all patients were on anticoagulation drugs during the study  results from the prepic study and other studies which have shown many longterm complications of ivc filters led to the introduction of retrievable ivc filters the first retrievable ivc filters were approved by fda in 2003 and 2004  in 2012 the american college of chest physicians recommended ivc filters for those with contraindications to anticoagulation who either have acute pe or acute proximal above the knee deep vein thrombosis dvt     in those with initial acute proximal dvt or acute pe who had ivc filters placed instead of anticoagulation and who have their risk of bleeding resolve the american college of chest physicians suggested in 2012 that they receive a standard course of anticoagulation   while ivc filters are associated with a long term risk of dvt  they are not alone reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation  ivc filters are placed endovascularly meaning that they are inserted via the blood vessels historically ivc filters were placed surgically but with modern filters that can be compressed into much thinner catheters access to the venous system can be obtained via the femoral vein the large vein in the groin the internal jugular vein the large vein in the neck or the arm veins with one design choice of route depends mainly on the number and location of any blood clot within the venous system to place the filter a catheter is guided into the ivc using fluoroscopic guidance then the filter is pushed through the catheter and deployed into the desired location usually just below the junction of the ivc and the lowest renal vein  review of prior crosssectional imaging or a venogram of the ivc is performed before deploying the filter to assess for potential anatomic variations thrombi within the ivc or areas of stenoses as well as to estimate the diameter of the ivc rarely ultrasoundguided placement is preferred in the setting of contrast allergy renal insufficiency and when patient immobility is desired the size of the ivc may affect which filter is deployed as some such as the birds nest are approved to accommodate larger cavae there are situations where the filter is placed above the renal veins eg pregnant patients or women of childbearing age renal or gonadal vein thromboses etc also if there is duplication of the ivc the filter is placed above the confluence of the two ivcs   or a filter can be placed within each ivc  while the ability to retrieve a filter does exist for many models it cannot be guaranteed that all cases of filter placement will allow for or be indicated for retrieval thus the requirements and indications for permanent placement of filters is used to decide on when to use both permanent and temporary ivc filters  longterm risk factors must be considered as well to include life expectancy of more than six months following insertion and the ability of the patient to comply with anticoagulation therapy  the decision to use a filter that is temporary vs permanent basically is tied to the expected duration of time that protection is needed to prevent pulmonary emboli from passing to the heart and lungs one such guideline is outlined below  while many studies have been done on the efficacy of vena cava filters there still have not been any major studies done on the actual placement and removal of the filters regarding standard guidelines which is why the society of interventional radiology created a multidisciplinary panel that developed the following guidelines to see if someone qualifies for implantation these are patients that should strongly consider having ivc filter placement as they are at greatest risk of pulmonary embolus this is a maybe category normally it represents patients who could benefit from an ivc filter but may be just fine without one as well these are usually very controversial reasons to do an ivc filter and most radiologists and doctors generally will not recommend an ivc filter if other options are available instead there is no current published data confirming the benefit of removing an ivc because of this the society of interventional radiology created a multidisciplinary panel that developed the following guidelines to see if someone qualifies for removal  the main function of a vena cava filter is to prevent death from massive pulmonary emboli longterm clinical followup studies have shown that this is accomplished in 96 of cases having a standard stainlesssteel greenfield filter  in august 2010 the fda released an initial communication on the risk and adverse events associated with long term use of an inferior vena cava filter  over a period of about 5 years they identify 921 events while not the majority of cases that number still represents a statistical significance of the use of longterm ivcs of these ivc filter side effects 328 involved device migration 146 involved embolizations after detachment of device components 70 involved perforation of the ivc and 56 involved filter fracture much of the medical community believes that this large number of adverse events is related to the heart filter remaining in place for longer than necessary common issues relating to failure to include death the other 4 of cases include while these side effects are not common less than 1020 of patients many do report issues stemming from the placement and complication of the ivc while inside of the body  numerous small published articles and case studies report describe similar issues to the above most notably even though the cases above are the exception and not the rule most radiologists object to doing prophylactic filter insertions in patients who do not have thromboembolic diseases  for the most part whenever possible interventional radiologists would rather start the patient on anticoagulants than use an ivc even if requested or referred via a doctor  while most ivc filters are made of nonferromagnetic materials there are a few types that are weakly ferromagnetic accordingly ivc filters fall under the mri safe and mri conditional categories depending mostly on type of material used during construction rarely will one find an mri not safe ivc filter as most of the steel and other ferromagnetic material devices have been discontinued via the fda ivc filters are attached to the vena cava via hooks on their ends some are compression springs which compress outward onto the side wall of the vena cava however they still have small hooks that retain their location these hooks aid in the anchoring and healing process as they allow the tissues to ingrow around them securing the ivc in place it is unlikely then after 4 to 6 weeks of healing that an mri of 15 tesla up to 3 tesla will cause any level of dislodging to occur for the ivc filter studies of mr examination of both animals and humans with implanted ivc filters have not reported complications or symptomatic filter displacement       several animal studies have even used realtime mr for the placement of ivc filters to check for rotation sheering and other artifacts   as part of the routing survey for mri studies patients who have ivc filters will often need verification from the doctor or medical records to state that the ivc is safe for the mri most patients with weakly or nonsafe ferromagnetic implants will be given a card which they keep on their person at all time that can help isolate if it is safe to do an mri for patients who have been denied mri scans for safety reasons doctors usually recommend the ct scan with contrast as an alternative most ivc filters that have been tested have been labeled as mri safe the remainder of ivc filters that have been tested are mr conditional patients who have been treated with nonferromagnetic ivc filters can undergo mr examination any time after filter implantation in patients who have been treated with a weakly ferromagnetic ivc filter gianturco bird nest ivc filter cook stainless steel greenfield vena cava filter boston scientific it is advised that the patient wait at least six weeks before undergoing an mr examination because these older devices initially may not be anchored as firmly in place as other devices discussed in the present context unless there is a strong clinical indication to perform the mr examination sooner after implantation and as long as there is no reason to suspect that the device is not positioned properly or that it is not firmly in place most studies of ivc filters have generally been conducted at 15 tesla or less although many ivc filters have now been evaluated at 3 tesla and deemed acceptable for mr examination   the concept of a removable ivc filter was first thought up in 1967  however it was not until 2003 and 2004 that the united states food and drug administration drafted regulations and requirements on creating devices that were fit for retrieval from the vena cava   and still even while the fda did approve of the models and designs it wasnt until 2005 that the society of interventional radiology sir convened a multidisciplinary conference to address the clinical application of nonpermanent vena cava filters retrievable filters are fitted with a device varying from model to model that allows them to be easily snared and pulled back into a catheter and removed from the body often through the jugular vein prior to 2004 filters that had been in the ivc for less than three weeks were considered suitable to attempt retrieval as filters that have been in place longer might have been overgrown by cells from the ivc wall and there was an increased risk of ivc injury if the filter is dislodged newer designs and developments in techniques mean that some filters can now be left in for prolonged periods and retrievals after a year are now being reported  this would include the aln bard g2 and g2x option tulip and celect filters it is important to note that the clinical exam prior to the removal of the filter is vital in understanding both the risk and pathophysiological effects removing the filter will have on the patient doctors and medical professionals must consider several key factors see indications for removing ivc filters the first ivc filter was created by kazi mobinuddin md     the mobinuddin filter was later replaced by the greenfield filter developed by lazar greenfield which had a lower rate of filter related complications

V a transdermal patch is a medicated adhesive patch that is placed on the skin to deliver a specific dose of medication through the skin and into the bloodstream often this promotes healing to an injured area of the body an advantage of a transdermal drug delivery route over other types of medication delivery such as oral topical intravenous intramuscular etc is that the patch provides a controlled release of the medication into the patient usually through either a porous membrane covering a reservoir of medication or through body heat melting thin layers of medication embedded in the adhesive the main disadvantage to transdermal delivery systems stems from the fact that the skin is a very effective barrier as a result only medications whose molecules are small enough to penetrate the skin can be delivered by this method a wide variety of pharmaceuticals are now available in transdermal patch form the first commercially available prescription patch was approved by the us food and drug administration in december 1979 these patches administered scopolamine for motion sickness     before these patches go into the market they have to be carefully studied one way to study these patches is through the use of franz diffusion cell systems this system is used to study the effects of temperature on the permeated amount of a specific drug on a certain type of membrane which in this case would be the membrane that is used in the patches a franz diffusion cell system is composed of a receptor and a donor cell in many of these research studies the following procedure is used the donor cell is set at a specific temperature the temperature of the environment  while the receptor cell is set at different one temperature of the body different runs are performed using different temperatures to study the impact of temperature on the release of a certain medicament through a certain type of membrane although different concentrations of the medicament are used in this study they do not affect the amount permeated through the membrane the process is constant from chemical kinetics it is concluded that these studies are zero order since the concentration plays no role in the permeated amount through the membrane some pharmaceuticals must be combined with substances such as alcohol within the patch to increase their ability to penetrate the skin in order to be used in a trans dermal patch others can overwhelm the body if applied in only one place and are often cut into sections and applied to different parts of the body to avoid this such as nitroglycerin many molecules however such as insulin are too large to pass through the skin without it being modified in some way several new technologies are being investigated to allow larger molecules to be delivered transdermally  the main components to a transdermal patch are other components includes stabilizer anti oxidants preservatives etc there are five main types of transdermal patches the adhesive layer of this system also contains the drug in this type of patch the adhesive layer not only serves to adhere the various layers together along with the entire system to the skin but is also responsible for the releasing of the drug the adhesive layer is surrounded by a temporary liner and a backing the multilayer druginadhesive patch is similar to the singlelayer system the multilayer system is different however in that it adds another layer of druginadhesive usually separated by a membrane but not in all cases one of the layers is for immediate release of the drug and other layer is for control release of drug from the reservoir this patch also has a temporary linerlayer and a permanent backing the drug release from this depends on membrane permeability and diffusion of drug molecules unlike the singlelayer and multilayer druginadhesive systems the reservoir transdermal system has a separate drug layer the drug layer is a liquid compartment containing a drug solution or suspension separated by the adhesive layer the drug reservoir is totally encapsulated in a shallow compartment molded from a drugimpermeable metallic plastic laminate with a ratecontrolling membrane made of a polymer like vinyl acetate on one surface this patch is also backed by the backing layer in this type of system the rate of release is zero order the matrix system has a drug layer of a semisolid matrix containing a drug solution or suspension the adhesive layer in this patch surrounds the drug layer partially overlaying it also known as a monolithic device in a vapour patch the adhesive layer not only serves to adhere the various layers together but also to release vapour vapour patches release essential oils for up to 6 hours and are mainly used for decongestion other vapour patches on the market improve quality of sleep or aid in smoking cessation a transdermal patch is classified by the us food and drug administration as a combination product consisting of a medical device combined with a drug or biological product that the device is designed to deliver prior to sale in the united states any transdermal patch product must apply for and receive approval from the food and drug administration demonstrating safety and efficacy for its intended use

V shampoo \u0283m\u02c8pu\u02d0 is a hair care product typically in the form of a viscous liquid that is used for cleaning hair less commonly shampoo is available in a bar form like a soap bar shampoo is used by applying it to wet hair massaging the product into the hair and then rinsing it out some users may follow a shampooing with the use of hair conditioner the goal of using shampoo is to remove the unwanted buildup in the hair without stripping out so much sebum as to make hair unmanageable shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate with a cosurfactant most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water specialty shampoos are available for people with dandruff colortreated hair gluten or wheat allergies an interest in using an allnatural organic botanical or plantderived product and infants and young children baby shampoo is less irritating there are also shampoos intended for animals that may contain insecticides or other medications for treatment of skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas   the word shampoo entered english language from india during the colonial era  it dates to 1762 and is derived from hindi ch\u0101mpo \u091a\u092a t\u0283\u02d0po\u02d0   itself derived from the sanskrit root capayati \u091a\u092a\u092f\u0924 which means to press knead soothe   in india a variety of herbs and their extracts were used as shampoos since ancient times a very effective early shampoo was made by boiling sapindus with dried indian gooseberry aamla and a few other herbs using the strained extract sapindus also known as soapberries or soapnuts is called ksuna sanskrit \u0915\u0937\u0923  in ancient indian texts and its fruit pulp contain saponins which are a natural surfactant the extract of soapberries a tropical tree widespread in india creates a lather which indian texts called phenaka sanskrit \u092b\u0928\u0915  it leaves the hair soft shiny and manageable other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai acacia concinna soapnuts sapindus hibiscus flowers   ritha sapindus mukorossi and arappu albizzia amara  guru nanak a sikh guru made references to soapberry tree and soap in 16th century  cleansing with hair and body massage champu during daily strip wash was an indulgence of early colonial traders in india when they returned to europe they introduced the newly learnt habits including hair treatment they called shampoo  during the early stages of shampoo in europe english hair stylists boiled shaved soap in water and added herbs to give the hair shine and fragrance commercially made shampoo was available from the turn of the 20th century a 1914 ad for canthrox shampoo in american magazine showed young women at camp washing their hair with canthrox in a lake magazine ads in 1914 by rexall featured harmony hair beautifier and shampoo  in 1927 liquid shampoo was invented by german inventor hans schwarzkopf in berlin whose name created a shampoo brand sold in europe originally soap and shampoo were very similar products both containing the same naturally derived surfactants a type of detergent modern shampoo as it is known today was first introduced in the 1930s with drene the first shampoo using synthetic surfactants instead of soap  early shampoos used in indonesia were made from the husk and straw merang of rice the husks and straws were burned into ash and the ashes which have alkaline properties are mixed with water to form lather the ashes and lather were scrubbed into the hair and rinsed out leaving the hair clean but very dry afterwards coconut oil was applied to the hair in order to moisturize it  certain native american tribes used extracts from north american plants as hair shampoo for example the costanoans of presentday coastal california used extracts from the coastal woodfern dryopteris expansa for a shampoo  before quinoa can be eaten the saponin must be washed out from the grain prior to cooking precolumbian andean civilizations used this soapy byproduct as a shampoo  shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate with a cosurfactant most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water to form a thick viscous liquid other essential ingredients include salt sodium chloride which is used to adjust the viscosity a preservative and fragrance   other ingredients are generally included in shampoo formulations to maximize the following qualities many shampoos are pearlescent this effect is achieved by addition of tiny flakes of suitable materials eg glycol distearate chemically derived from stearic acid which may have either animal or vegetable origins glycol distearate is a wax many shampoos also include silicone to provide conditioning benefits in the usa the food and drug administration fda mandates that shampoo containers accurately list ingredients on the products container the government further regulates what shampoo manufacturers can and cannot claim as any associated benefit shampoo producers often use these regulations to challenge marketing claims made by competitors helping to enforce these regulations while the claims may be substantiated however the testing methods and details of such claims are not as straightforward for example many products are purported to protect hair from damage due to ultraviolet radiation while the ingredient responsible for this protection does block uv it is not often present in a high enough concentration to be effective the north american hair research society has a program to certify functional claims based on third party testing shampoos made for treating medical conditions such as dandruff  itchy scalp are regulated as otc drugs  in the us marketplace in other parts of the world such as the eu there is a requirement for the antidandruff claim to be substantiated but it is not considered to be a medical problem a number of contact allergens are used as ingredients in shampoos and contact allergy caused by shampoos is well known  patch testing can identify ingredients to which patients are allergic after which a physician can help the patient find a shampoo that is free of the ingredient to which they are allergic   methylisothiazolinone mit is an ingredient used in many commercial shampoos mit and its closely related analog chloromethylisothiazolinone cmit affect the ability of young or developing neurons to grow processes axons and dendrites in tissue culture  some studies have shown mit to be allergenic and cytotoxic and this has led to some concern over its use   the ctfa cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association and the european scientific committee on cosmetic products and nonfood products intended for consumers sccnfp both released reports stating that methylisothiazolinone poses no health risks to humans at the low concentrations 001 used in finished cosmetic products  cosmetic companies have developed shampoos specifically for those who have dandruff these contain fungicides such as ketoconazole zinc pyrithione and selenium sulfide which reduce loose dander by killing malassezia furfur coal tar and salicylate derivatives are often used as well despite a big success of medicated shampoos there are also other alternatives for people who dislike using a lot of chemicals organic natural shampoos can be a suitable alternative these shampoos often use tea tree oil essential oils and extracts  many companies have also developed colorprotection shampoos suitable for colored hair many of these shampoos contain gentle cleansers or so the companies claim many people suffer from eczema on their palms and their head  some find that wheat or gluten the protein found in many grains including wheat is the cause particularly if they are sensitive to this in food eg celiac disease wheat allergy shampoo can often go into the mouth particularly for children so all individuals who are on glutenfree diets may prefer to find a glutenfree shampoo shampoo manufacturers are starting to recognize this and there are now glutenfree and wheatfree products available wheat derivatives and ingredients from the other gluten grains are commonly used as binders to help the shampoo stick together and are also used as emollients in the form of oils following is a list of grainderived shampoo ingredients  most of these ingredients do not theoretically contain any intact wheat proteins but may do so due to incomplete processing or contamination some companies use allnatural organic botanical or plantderived ingredients such as plant extracts or oils combining these additions with one or more typical surfactants the use of the term natural is not regulated in any form leading many companies to greenwash consumers into buying shampoos with harsh stripping sufactants without their knowledge a compnay may also slightly change the same of a sufactant to another acceptable form in order to fool unwitting customers   shampoo for infants and young children is formulated so that it is less irritating and usually less prone to produce a stinging or burning sensation if it were to get into the eyes for example johnsons baby shampoo advertises under the premise of no more tears this is accomplished by one or more of the following formulation strategies the distinction in 4 above does not completely surmount the controversy over the use of shampoo ingredients to mitigate eye sting produced by other ingredients or the use of the products so formulated the considerations in 3 and 4 frequently result in a much greater multiplicity of surfactants being used in individual baby shampoos than in other shampoos and the detergency or foaming of such products may be compromised thereby the monoanionic sulfonated surfactants and viscosityincreasing or foam stabilizing alkanolamides seen so frequently in other shampoos are much less common in the better baby shampoos shampoo intended for animals may contain insecticides or other medications for treatment of skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange these must never be used on humans while some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs such as zinc in antidandruff shampoos are potentially toxic when ingested by animals special care must be taken not to use those products on pets cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets commonly dogs and cats are normally intended to do more than just clean the pets coat or skin most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas the main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals antiseborrheic antibacterials antifungals emollients emulsifiers and humectants whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarians indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused generally insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin pyrethroids such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats and carbaryl these ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections these might contain ingredients such as miconazole chlorhexidine providone iodine ketoconazole or selenium sulfide which cannot be used on cats bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos they commonly contain benzoyl peroxide chlorhexidine povidone iodine triclosan ethyl lactate or sulfur antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies  these usually contain colloidal oatmeal hydrocortisone aloe vera pramoxine hydrochloride menthol diphenhydramine sulfur or salicylic acid these ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats these shampoos are made of sulfur salicylic acid refined tar which cannot be used on cats selenium sulfide cannot be used on cats and benzoyl peroxide all these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa which is a condition characterized by excess oils dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin they usually contain oils such as almond corn cottonseed coconut olive peanut persia safflower sesame lanolin mineral or paraffin oil the emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients these include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol laureth5 lecithin peg4 dilaurate stearic acid stearyl alcohol carboxylic acid lactic acid urea sodium lactate propylene glycol glycerin or polyvinylpyrrolidone although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective some others may be less effective for some condition than another yet although natural pet shampoos exist it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil  on the contrary oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skintolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats especially in the case of cats pet shampoos which include fragrances deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity solid shampoos or shampoo bars use as their surfactants soaps or other surfactants formulated as solids they have the advantage of being spillproof they are easy to apply one may simply rub the bar over wet hair and work the soaped hair into a low lather stiff nonpourable clear gels to be squeezed from a tube were once popular forms of shampoo and can be produced by increasing a shampoos viscosity this type of shampoo cannot be spilled but unlike a solid it can still be lost down the drain by sliding off wet skin or hair shampoos in the form of pastes or creams were formerly marketed in jars or tubes the contents were wet but not completely dissolved they would apply faster than solids and dissolve quickly antibacterial shampoos are often used in veterinary medicine for various conditions   as well as in humans before some surgical procedures   closely associated with environmentalism the no poo movement consists of people rejecting the societal norm of frequent shampoo use some adherents of the nopoo movement use baking soda or vinegar to wash their hair while others use diluted honey other people use nothing rinsing their hair only with conditioner   one advocate of this method is devacurl who advertise their shampoos as nopoo and stress a stricly sulfatefree regimen to keep hair in good condition in the 1970s ads featuring farrah fawcett and christie brinkley asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week this mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing using shampoo every day removes sebum the oil produced by the scalp this causes the sebaceous glands to produce oil at a higher rate to compensate for what is lost during shampooing according to michelle hanjani a dermatologist at columbia university a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate resulting in less grease in the scalp  although this approach might seem unappealing to some individuals many people try alternate shampooing techniques like the baking soda and vinegar in order to avoid chemicals and ingredients used in many shampoos which make hair greasy over

V an intrauterine device iud or coil  is a small contraceptive device often tshaped often containing either copper or levonorgestrel which is inserted into the uterus they are one form of longacting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control  failure rates with the copper iud is about 08 while the levonorgestrel iud has a failure rate of 02 in the first year of use  among types of birth control they along with birth control implants result in the greatest satisfaction among users  as of 2007 iuds are the most widely used form of reversible contraception with more than 180million users worldwide  evidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents  and those who have and have not previously had children  iuds do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery  they may also be used immediately after an abortion  once removed even after long term use fertility returns to normal immediately  while copper iuds may increase menstrual bleeding and result in more painful cramps  hormonal iuds may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether  cramping can be treated with nsaids  other potential complications include expulsion 25 and rarely perforation of the uterus less than 07   a previous model of the intrauterine device the dalkon shield was associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion    the types of intrauterine devices available and the names they go by differ by location in the united states there are two types available  the who atc labels both copper and hormonal devices as iuds in the united kingdom there are over 10 different types of copper iuds available in the uk the term iud refers only to these copper devices hormonal intrauterine contraception is considered to be a different type of birth control and is labeled with the term intrauterine system ius   copper iuds primarily work by disrupting sperm mobility and damaging sperm so that they are prevented from joining with an egg copper acts as a spermicide within the uterus increasing levels of copper ions prostaglandins and white blood cells within the uterine and tubal fluids   the increased copper ions in the cervical mucus inhibit the sperms motility and viability preventing sperm from traveling through the cervical mucus or destroying it as it passes through  copper iuds have a first year failure rate ranging from 01 to 22  most copper iuds have a plastic tshaped frame that is wound around with pure electrolytic copper wire andor has copper collars sleeves the arms of the frame hold the iud in place near the top of the uterus the paragard tcu 380a measures 32mm 126 horizontally top of the t and 36mm 142 vertically leg of the t copper iuds are becoming increasingly popular because they are more resistant to corrosion in the eurogine gold t iud  which is made in spain there is a gold core which further prevents the copper from fragmenting or corroding goldringmedusa is a differentlyshaped german version of the gold t  another form of aucu iud is called goldlily which is made by the hungarian company radelkis goldlily consists of a layer of copper wires wrapped around an original layer of gold wires and it provides electrochemical protection in addition to ionic protection  silver iuds also exist radelkis also makes silverlily which is similar to goldlily and goldringmedusa is available in an agcu version as well novat 380 contains a strengthening silver core but does not incorporate silver ions themselves to provide electrochemical protection    other shapes of iud include the socalled ushaped iuds such as the load and multiload and the frameless iud that holds several hollow cylindrical minuscule copper beads it is held in place by a suture knot to the fundus of the uterus it is mainly available in china europe and germany although some clinics in canada can provide it a framed copper iud called the iub scu300a coils during deployment to form a three dimensional spherical shape and is based on a shape memory alloy core  advantages of the copper iud include its ability to provide emergency contraception up to five days after unprotected sex it is the most effective form of emergency contraception available  it works by preventing fertilization or implantation however does not affect already implanted embryos  it contains no hormones so it can be used while breastfeeding and fertility returns quickly after removal  copper iuds are also available in a wider range of sizes and shapes than hormonal iuds disadvantages include the possibility of heavier menstrual periods and more painful cramps  in addition to copper noble metal and progestogen iuds patients in china can get copper iuds with indomethacin this nonhormonal compound reduces the severity of menstrual bleeding and these coils are popular  hormonal iuds brand names mirena skyla and liletta in the us referred to as intrauterine systems in the uk work by releasing a small amount of levonorgestrel a progestin the primary mechanism of action is thickening of cervical mucus making it impenetrable to sperm they also inhibit ovulation in some users decrease the ability of sperm to penetrate the ovum and thin the endometrial lining  because they thin the endometrial lining they reduce or even prevent menstrual bleeding and can be used to treat menorrhagia heavy menses once pathologic causes of menorrhagia such as uterine polyps have been ruled out  the progestin released by hormonal iuds primarily acts locally use of mirena results in much lower systemic progestin levels than other verylowdose progestogen only contraceptives  mirena is approved for use up to five years in the us though studies support its efficacy for up to seven years  skyla uses the same mechanism of action but is smaller and releases a lower dose of levonorgestrel and is only approved for up to three years liletta is more similar to mirena in both shape and dose of levonorgestrel released it has currently been approved for usage up to three years  inert iuds are iuds with no bioactive components they are made of inert materials like stainless steel such as the stainless steel ring or ssr a flexible ring of steel coils that can deform to be pushed through the cervix or plastic such as the lippes loop which can be inserted through the cervix in a cannula and takes a trapezoidal shape within the uterus they are less effective than copper or hormonal iuds with a side effect profile similar to copper iuds their primary mechanism of action is inducing a local foreign body reaction which makes the uterine environment hostile both to sperm and to implantation of an embryo  they may have higher rates of preventing pregnancy after fertilization instead of before fertilization compared to copper or hormonal iuds  no inert iuds are approved for use by the healthcare authorities in the usa uk or canada in china where iuds are the most common form of contraception copper iud production replaced inert iud production in 1993  however as of 2008 the most common iud used by immigrants presenting to canadian clinics for removal of iuds placed in china was still the ssr as the ssr has no string for removal it can present a challenge to healthcare providers unfamiliar with iud types not available in their region  regardless of containing progestogen or copper potential side effects of intrauterine devices include expulsion uterus perforation pelvic inflammatory disease especially in the first 21 days after insertion as well as irregular menstrual pattern a small probability of pregnancy remains after iud insertion and when it occurs theres a greater risk of ectopic pregnancy substantial pain that needs active management occurs in approximately 17 of nulliparous women and approximately 11 of parous women  in such cases nsaid are evidenced to be effective  however no prophylactic analgesic drug have been found to be effective for routine use for women undergoing iud insertion  also iuds with progestogen confer an increased risk of ovarian cysts  and iuds with copper confer an increased risk of heavier periods menstrual cup companies recommend that women with iuds who are considering using menstrual cups should consult with their gynecologists before use there have been rare cases in which women using iuds dislodged them when removing their menstrual cups however this can also happen with tampon use  iuds primarily work by preventing fertilization  the progestogen released from the hormonal iuds may prevent ovulation from occurring but only partially   the hormone also thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm cannot reach the fallopian tubes the copper iuds contain no hormones but the copper ions in the cervical mucus are toxic to sperm they also cause the uterus and fallopian tubes to produce a fluid that contains white blood cells copper ions enzymes and prostaglandins a combination that is also toxic to sperm  the very high effectiveness of copperreleasing iuds as emergency contraceptives implies they may also act by preventing implantation of the blastocyst   in nonemergency use prevention of implantation is at most an exceptional method of action not a typical mechanism of action  the history of iuds dates back to the interuterine devices of the early 1900s unlike iuds early interuterine devices crossed both the vagina and the uterus causing a high incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease in a time period when gonorrhea was endemic the first iud was developed by the german physician richter of waldenburg his device was made of silkworm gut and was not widely used  ernst grfenberg another german physician after whom the gspot is named created the first ring iud grfenbergs ring made of silver filaments his work was suppressed during the nazi regime when contraception was considered a threat to aryan women  he moved to the united states where his colleagues h hall and m stone took up his work after his death and created the stainless steel hallstone ring a japanese doctor named tenrei ota also developed a silver or gold iud called the precea or pressure ring  jack lippes helped begin the increase of iud use in the united states in the late 1950s in this time thermoplastics which can bend for insertion and retain their original shape became the material used for firstgeneration iuds lippes also devised the addition of the monofilament nylon string which facilitates iud removal his trapezoid shape lippes loop iud became one of the most popular first generation iuds in the following years many different shaped plastic iuds were invented and marketed  these included the infamous dalkon shield whose poor design caused bacterial infection and led to thousands of lawsuits although the dalkon shield was removed from the market it had a lasting negative impact on iud use in the united states  the invention of the copper iud in the 1960s brought with it the capital t shaped design used by most modern iuds us physician howard tatum determined that the t shape would work better with the shape of the uterus which forms a t when contracted he predicted this would reduce rates of iud expulsion  together tatum and chilean physician jaime zipper discovered that copper could be an effective spermicide and developed the first copper iud tcu200 improvements by tatum led to the creation of the tcu380a paragard which is currently the preferred copper iud  the hormonal iud was also invented in the 1960s and 1970s initially the goal was to mitigate the increased menstrual bleeding associated with copper and inert iuds the first model progestasert was conceived of by antonio scommengna and created by tapani j v luukkainen but the device only lasted for one year of use  progestasert was manufactured until 2001  one commercial hormonal iud which is currently available mirena was also developed by luukkainen and released in 1976  the manufacturer of the mirena bayer ag became the target of multiple lawsuits over allegations that bayer failed to adequately warn users that the iud could pierce the uterus and migrate to other parts of the body  mechanism of actioncopperreleasing iucswhen used as a regular or emergency method of contraception copperreleasing iucs act primarily to prevent fertilization emergency insertion of a copper iuc is significantly more effective than the use of ecps reducing the risk of pregnancy following unprotected intercourse by more than 99  this very high level of effectiveness implies that emergency insertion of a copper iuc must prevent some pregnancies after fertilizationemergency contraceptive pillsto make an informed choice women must know that ecpslike the birth control pill patch ring shot and implant and even like breastfeeding prevent pregnancy primarily by delaying or inhibiting ovulation and inhibiting fertilization but may at times inhibit implantation of a fertilized egg in the endometrium however women should also be informed that the best available evidence indicates that ecps prevent pregnancy by mechanisms that do not involve interference with postfertilization eventsecps do not cause abortion  or harm an established pregnancy pregnancy begins with implantation according to medical authorities such as the us fda the national institutes of health  and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog ulipristal acetate upa one study has demonstrated that up can delay ovulation  another study found that upa altered the endometrium but whether this change would inhibit implantation is unknown p 122progestinonly emergency contraceptive pills early treatment with ecps containing only the progestin levonorgestrel has been show to impair the ovulatory process

how does ec workin 2002 a judicial review ruled that pregnancy begins at implantation not fertilisation  the possible mechanisms of action should be explained to the patient as some methods may not be acceptable depending on individual beliefs about the onset of pregnancy and abortioncopperbearing intrauterine device cuiud copper is toxic to the ovum and sperm and thus the copperbearing

V defibrillation is a common treatment for lifethreatening cardiac dysrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical current to the heart with a device called a defibrillator this depolarizes a critical mass of the heart muscle terminates the dysrhythmia and allows normal sinus rhythm to be reestablished by the bodys natural pacemaker in the sinoatrial node of the heart defibrillators can be external transvenous or implanted implantable cardioverterdefibrillator depending on the type of device used or needed some external units known as automated external defibrillators aeds automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little or no training at all   in a study of cpr and defibrillation for cardiac arrest under ideal conditions survival with normal neurological function occurred in 38 assuming survival without defibrillation to be zero this is equivalent to saving the life of 2 out of 5 people using defibrillation furthermore when considering only those with a heart rhythm correctable by defibrillation ventricular fibrillation survival rate was 59 equivalent to saving 3 out 5 survival rates from cardiac arrest was less however in more common circumstances seen outside of the study including among ill hospitalized persons people without access to immediate 45 minutes cpr and for those whose arrest is not witnessed  the units are used in conjunction with electrocardiogram readers which the healthcare provider uses to diagnose a cardiac condition the healthcare provider will then decide what charge in joules to use based on proven guidelines and experience and will deliver the shock through paddles or pads on the patients chest as they require detailed medical knowledge these units are generally only found in hospitals and on some ambulances for instance every nhs ambulance in the united kingdom is equipped with a manual defibrillator for use by the attending paramedics and technicians in the united states many advanced emts and all paramedics are trained to recognize lethal arrhythmias and deliver appropriate electrical therapy with a manual defibrillator when appropriate these are the direct descendants of the work of beck and lown they are virtually identical to the external version except that the charge is delivered through internal paddles in direct contact with the heart these are almost exclusively found in operating theatres rooms where the chest is likely to be open or can be opened quickly by a surgeon these simpletouse units are based on computer technology which is designed to analyze the heart rhythm itself and then advise the user whether a shock is required they are designed to be used by lay persons who require little training to operate them correctly they are usually limited in their interventions to delivering high joule shocks for vf ventricular fibrillation and vt ventricular tachycardia rhythms making them generally of limited use to health professionals who could diagnose and treat a wider range of problems with a manual or semiautomatic unit the automatic units also take time generally 1020 seconds to diagnose the rhythm where a professional could diagnose and treat the condition far more quickly with a manual unit  these time intervals for analysis which require stopping chest compressions have been shown in a number of studies to have a significant negative effect on shock success  this effect led to the recent change in the aha defibrillation guideline calling for two minutes of cpr after each shock without analyzing the cardiac rhythm and some bodies recommend that aeds should not be used when manual defibrillators and trained operators are available  automated external defibrillators are generally either held by trained personnel who will attend incidents or are public access units which can be found in places including corporate and government offices shopping centres airports restaurants casinos hotels sports stadiums schools and universities community centers fitness centers and health clubs  the locating of a public access aed should take into account where large groups of people gather and the risk category associated with these people to ascertain whether the risk of a sudden cardiac arrest incident is high for example a center for teenage children is a particularly low risk category as children very rarely enter heart rhythms such as vf ventricular fibrillation or vt ventricular tachycardia being generally young and fit and the most common causes of pediatric cardiac arrest are respiratory arrest and trauma  where the heart is more likely to enter asystole or pea where an aed is of no use on the other hand a large office building with a high ratio of males over 50 is a relatively higher risk environment  in many areas emergency services vehicles are likely to carry aeds emtbasics in most areas are not trained in manual defibrillation and often carry an aed instead some ambulances carry an aed in addition to a manual unit in addition some police or fire service vehicles carry an aed for use by first responders some areas have dedicated community first responders who are volunteers tasked with keeping an aed and taking it to any victims in their area it is also increasingly common to find aeds on transport such as commercial airlines and cruise ships the presence of an aed can be a particularly decisive factor in cardiac patient survival in these scenarios as professional medical assistance may be hours away there are 2 types of aeds fully automated and semi automated most aeds are semi automated a semi automated aed automatically diagnoses heart rhythms and determines if a shock is necessary if a shock is advised the user must then push a button to administer the shock a fully automated aed automatically diagnoses the heart rhythm and advises the user to stand back while the shock is automatically given also some types of aeds come with advanced features such as a manual override or an ecg display in order to make them highly visible public access aeds often are brightly coloured and are mounted in protective cases near the entrance of a building when these protective cases are opened and the defibrillator removed some will sound a buzzer to alert nearby staff to their removal but do not necessarily summon emergency services all trained aed operators should also know to phone for an ambulance when sending for or using an aed as the patient will be unconscious which always requires ambulance attendance also known as automatic internal cardiac defibrillator aicd these devices are implants similar to pacemakers and many can also perform the pacemaking function they constantly monitor the patients heart rhythm and automatically administer shocks for various lifethreatening arrhythmias according to the devices programming many modern devices can distinguish between ventricular fibrillation ventricular tachycardia and more benign arrhythmias like supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation some devices may attempt overdrive pacing prior to synchronised cardioversion when the lifethreatening arrhythmia is ventricular fibrillation the device is programmed to proceed immediately to an unsynchronized shock there are cases where the patients icd may fire constantly or inappropriately this is considered a medical emergency as it depletes the devices battery life causes significant discomfort and anxiety to the patient and in some cases may actually trigger lifethreatening arrhythmias some emergency medical services personnel are now equipped with a ring magnet to place over the device which effectively disables the shock function of the device while still allowing the pacemaker to function if the device is so equipped if the device is shocking frequently but appropriately ems personnel may administer sedation a development of the aicd is a portable external defibrillator that is worn like a vest  the unit monitors the patient 24 hours a day and will automatically deliver a biphasic shock if needed this device is mainly indicated in patients awaiting an implantable defibrillator as of february 2011 only one company manufactures these portable external defibrillators and they are of limited availability the efficacy of a cardiac defibrillator is highly dependent on the position of its electrodes most internal defibrillators are implanted in octogenarians but a few children need the devices implanting defibrillators in children is particularly difficult because children are small will grow over time and possess cardiac anatomy that differs from that of adults recently researchers were able to create a software modeling system capable of mapping an individuals thorax and determining the optimal position for an external or internal cardiac defibrillator   with the help of preexisting surgical planning applications the software uses myocardial voltage gradients to predict the likelihood of successful defibrillation according to the critical mass hypothesis defibrillation is effective only if it produces a threshold voltage gradient in a large fraction of the myocardial mass usually a gradient of three to five volts per centimeter is needed in 95 of the heart voltage gradients of over 60 vcm can damage tissue the modeling software seeks to obtain safe voltage gradients above the defibrillation threshold early simulations using the software suggest that small changes in electrode positioning can have large effects on defibrillation and despite engineering hurdles that remain the modeling system promises to help guide the placement of implanted defibrillators in children and adults recent mathematical models of defibrillation are based on the bidomain model of cardiac tissue   calculations using a realistic heart shape and fiber geometry are required to determine how cardiac tissue responds to a strong electrical shock the connection between the defibrillator and the patient consists of a pair of electrodes each provided with electrically conductive gel in order to ensure a good connection and to minimize electrical resistance also called chest impedance despite the dc discharge which would burn the patient gel may be either wet similar in consistency to surgical lubricant or solid similar to gummi candy solidgel is more convenient because there is no need to clean the used gel off of patients skin after defibrillation the solid gel is easily lifted off of the patient however the use of solidgel presents a higher risk of burns during defibrillation since wetgel electrodes more evenly conduct electricity into the body paddle electrodes which were the first type developed come without gel and must have the gel applied in a separate step selfadhesive electrodes come prefitted with gel there is a general division of opinion over which type of electrode is superior in hospital settings the american heart association favors neither and all modern manual defibrillators used in hospitals allow for swift switching between selfadhesive pads and traditional paddles each type of electrode has its merits and demerits as discussed below the most wellknown type of electrode widely depicted in films and television is the traditional metal paddle with an insulated usually plastic handle this type must be held in place on the patients skin with approximately 25lbs of force while a shock or a series of shocks is delivered paddles offer a few advantages over selfadhesive pads many hospitals in the united states continue the use of paddles with disposable gel pads attached in most cases due to the inherent speed with which these electrodes can be placed and used this is critical during cardiac arrest as each second of nonperfusion means tissue loss modern paddles allow for monitoring electrocardiography though in hospital situations separate monitoring leads are often already in place paddles are reusable being cleaned after use and stored for the next patient gel is therefore not preapplied and must be added before these paddles are used on the patient paddles are generally only found on manual external units newer types of resuscitation electrodes are designed as an adhesive pad which includes either solid or wet gel these are peeled off their backing and applied to the patients chest when deemed necessary much the same as any other sticker the electrodes are then connected to a defibrillator much as the paddles would be if defibrillation is required the machine is charged and the shock is delivered without any need to apply any additional gel or to retrieve and place any paddles most adhesive electrodes are designed to be used not only for defibrillation but also for transcutaneous pacing and synchronized electrical cardioversion these adhesive pads are found on most automated and semiautomated units and are replacing paddles entirely in nonhospital settings in hospital for cases where cardiac arrest is likely to occur but has not yet selfadhesive pads may be placed prophylactically pads also offer an advantage to the untrained user and to medics working in the suboptimal conditions of the field pads do not require extra leads to be attached for monitoring and they do not require any force to be applied as the shock is delivered thus adhesive electrodes minimize the risk of the operator coming into physical and thus electrical contact with the patient as the shock is delivered by allowing the operator to be up to several feet away the risk of electrical shock to others remains unchanged as does that of shock due to operator misuse selfadhesive electrodes are singleuse only they may be used for multiple shocks in a single course of treatment but are replaced if or in case the patient recovers then reenters cardiac arrest resuscitation electrodes are placed according to one of two schemes the anteriorposterior scheme is the preferred scheme for longterm electrode placement one electrode is placed over the left precordium the lower part of the chest in front of the heart the other electrode is placed on the back behind the heart in the region between the scapula this placement is preferred because it is best for noninvasive pacing the anteriorapex scheme can be used when the anteriorposterior scheme is inconvenient or unnecessary in this scheme the anterior electrode is placed on the right below the clavicle the apex electrode is applied to the left side of the patient just below and to the left of the pectoral muscle this scheme works well for defibrillation and cardioversion as well as for monitoring an ecg defibrillators were first demonstrated in 1899 by jeanlouis prvost and frdric batelli two physiologists from university of geneva switzerland they discovered that small electrical shocks could induce ventricular fibrillation in dogs and that larger charges would reverse the condition   in 1933 dr albert hyman heart specialist at the beth davis hospital of new york city and c henry hyman an electrical engineer looking for an alternative to injecting powerful drugs directly into the heart came up with an invention that used an electrical shock in place of drug injection this invention was called the hyman otor where a hollow needle is used to pass an insulated wire to the heart area to deliver the electrical shock the hollow steel needle acted as one end of the circuit and the tip of the insulated wire the other end whether the hyman otor was a success is unknown  the external defibrillator as known today was invented by electrical engineer william kouwenhoven in 1930 william studied the relation between the electric shocks and its effects on human heart when he was a student at johns hopkins university school of engineering his studies helped him to invent a device for external jump start of the heart he invented the defibrillator and tested on a dog like prvost and batelli the first use on a human was in 1947 by claude beck  professor of surgery at case western reserve university becks theory was that ventricular fibrillation often occurred in hearts which were fundamentally healthy in his terms hearts that are too good to die and that there must be a way of saving them beck first used the technique successfully on a 14yearold boy who was being operated on for a congenital chest defect the boys chest was surgically opened and manual cardiac massage was undertaken for 45 minutes until the arrival of the defibrillator beck used internal paddles on either side of the heart along with procainamide an antiarrhythmic drug and achieved return of normal sinus rhythm these early defibrillators used the alternating current from a power socket transformed from the 110240 volts available in the line up to between 300 and 1000 volts to the exposed heart by way of paddle type electrodes the technique was often ineffective in reverting vf while morphological studies showed damage to the cells of the heart muscle post mortem the nature of the ac machine with a large transformer also made these units very hard to transport and they tended to be large units on wheels until the early 1950s defibrillation of the heart was possible only when the chest cavity was open during surgery the technique used an alternating voltage from a 300 or greater volt source derived from standard ac power delivered to the sides of the exposed heart by paddle electrodes where each electrode was a flat or slightly concave metal plate of about 40mm diameter the closedchest defibrillator device which applied an alternating voltage of greater than 1000 volts conducted by means of externally applied electrodes through the chest cage to the heart was pioneered by dr v eskin with assistance by a klimov in frunze ussr today known as bishkek kyrgyzstan in the mid1950s  the duration of ac shocks was typically in the range of 100150 milliseconds  early successful experiments of successful defibrillation by the discharge of a capacitor performed on animals were reported by n l gurvich and g s yunyev in 1939  in 1947 their works were reported in western medical journals  serial production of gurvichs pulse defibrillator started in 1952 model \u0438\u04341\u0432\u044d\u0438 the abbreviation stands for \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439

electrotechnical institute the device was manufactured by the electromechanical plant of the institute it is described in detail in gurvichs 1957 book heart fibrillation and defibrillation  the first czechoslovak universal defibrillator prema was manufactured in 1957 by the company prema designed by dr bohumil pele\u0161ka in 1958 his device was awarded grand prix at expo 58  in 1958 us senator hubert h humphrey visited nikita khrushchev and among other things he visited the moscow institute of reanimatology where among others he met with gurvich  humphrey immediately recognized importance of reanimation research and after that a number of american doctors visited gurvich at the same time humphrey worked on establishing of a federal program in the national institute of health in physiology and medicine telling to the congress lets compete with ussr in research on reversibility of death  in 1959 bernard lown commenced research in his animal laboratory in collaboration with engineer barouh berkovits into a technique which involved charging of a bank of capacitors to approximately 1000 volts with an energy content of 100200 joules then delivering the charge through an inductance such as to produce a heavily damped sinusoidal wave of finite duration 5 milliseconds to the heart by way of paddle electrodes this team further developed an understanding of the optimal timing of shock delivery in the cardiac cycle enabling the application of the device to arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation atrial flutter and supraventricular tachycardias in the technique known as cardioversion the lownberkovits waveform as it was known was the standard for defibrillation until the late 1980s earlier in the 1980s the mu lab at the university of missouri had pioneered numerous studies introducing a new waveform called a biphasic truncated waveform bte in this waveform an exponentially decaying dc voltage is reversed in polarity about halfway through the shock time then continues to decay for some time after which the voltage is cut off or truncated the studies showed that the biphasic truncated waveform could be more efficacious while requiring the delivery of lower levels of energy to produce defibrillation  an added benefit was a significant reduction in weight of the machine the bte waveform combined with automatic measurement of transthoracic impedance is the basis for modern defibrillators  a major breakthrough was the introduction of portable defibrillators used out of the hospital already pele\u0161kas prema defibrillator was designed to be more portable than original gurvichs model in soviet union a portable version of gurvichs defibrillator model \u0434\u043f\u04303 dpa3 was reported in 1959  in the west this was pioneered in the early 1960s by prof frank pantridge in belfast today portable defibrillators are among the many very important tools carried by ambulances they are the only proven way to resuscitate a person who has had a cardiac arrest unwitnessed by emergency medical services ems who is still in persistent ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia at the arrival of prehospital providers gradual improvements in the design of defibrillators partly based on the work developing implanted versions see below have led to the availability of automated external defibrillators these devices can analyse the heart rhythm by themselves diagnose the shockable rhythms and charge to treat this means that no clinical skill is required in their use allowing lay people to respond to emergencies effectively until the mid 90s external defibrillators delivered a lown type waveform see bernard lown which was a heavily damped sinusoidal impulse having a mainly uniphasic characteristic biphasic defibrillation alternates the direction of the pulses completing one cycle in approximately 12 milliseconds biphasic defibrillation was originally developed and used for implantable cardioverterdefibrillators when applied to external defibrillators biphasic defibrillation significantly decreases the energy level necessary for successful defibrillation decreasing the risk of burns and myocardial damage ventricular fibrillation vf could be returned to normal sinus rhythm in 60 of cardiac arrest patients treated with a single shock from a monophasic defibrillator most biphasic defibrillators have a first shock success rate of greater than 90  a further development in defibrillation came with the invention of the implantable device known as an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator or icd this was pioneered at sinai hospital in baltimore by a team that included stephen heilman alois langer jack lattuca morton mower michel mirowski and mir imran with the help of industrial collaborator intec systems of pittsburgh  mirowski teamed up with mower and staewen and together they commenced their research in 1969 but it was 11 years before they treated their first patient similar developmental work was carried out by schuder and colleagues at the university of missouri the work was commenced despite doubts amongst leading experts in the field of arrhythmias and sudden death there was doubt that their ideas would ever become a clinical reality in 1962 bernard lown introduced the external dc defibrillator this device applied a direct current from a discharging capacitor through the chest wall into the heart to stop heart fibrillation  in 1972 lown stated in the journal circulation  the very rare patient who has frequent bouts of ventricular fibrillation is best treated in a coronary care unit and is better served by an effective antiarrhythmic program or surgical correction of inadequate coronary blood flow or ventricular malfunction in fact the implanted defibrillator system represents an imperfect solution in search of a plausible and practical application  the problems to be overcome were the design of a system which would allow detection of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia despite the lack of financial backing and grants they persisted and the first device was implanted in february 1980 at johns hopkins hospital by dr levi watkins jr assisted by vivien thomas modern icds do not require a thoracotomy and possess pacing cardioversion and defibrillation capabilities the invention of implantable units is invaluable to some regular sufferers of heart problems although they are generally only given to those people who have already had a cardiac episode people can live long normal lives with the devices many patients have multiple implants a patient in houston texas had an implant at the age of 18 in 1994 by the recent dr antonio pacifico he was awarded youngest patient with defibrillator in 1996 though today these devices are implanted into small babies shortly after birth as devices that can quickly produce dramatic improvements in patient health defibrillators are often depicted in movies television video games and other fictional media their function however is often exaggerated with the defibrillator inducing a sudden violent jerk or convulsion by the patient in reality although the muscles may contract such dramatic patient presentation is rare similarly medical providers are often depicted defibrillating patients with a flatline ecg rhythm also known as asystole this is not done in real life as the heart is not restarted by the defibrillator itself only the cardiac arrest rhythms ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia are normally defibrillated this is because the whole point of the exercise is to shock the patient into asystole and then let their heart start back beating normally someone who is already in asystole cannot be helped by electrical means and usually needs urgent cpr and intravenous medication there are also several heart rhythms that can be shocked when the patient is not in cardiac arrest such as supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia that produces a pulse this morecomplicated procedure is known as cardioversion not defibrillation in australia up until the 1990s it was quite rare for ambulances to carry defibrillators this changed in 1990 after australian media mogul kerry packer had a heart attack and purely by chance the ambulance that responded to the call carried a defibrillator after recovering kerry packer donated a large sum to the ambulance service of new south wales in order that all ambulances in new south wales should be fitted with a personal defibrillator which is why defibrillators in australia are sometimes colloquially called packer whackers

compelling evidence that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired hiv infection in men by about 60 the who and unaids recommendations emphasize that male circumcision should be considered an efficacious intervention for hiv prevention in countries and regions with heterosexual epidemics a high incidence of hiv and low prevalence of male circumcision  the extensive research on the benefits of male circumcision provided the impetus to add vmmc to the pepfar blueprint in order to achieve an aidsfree generation as declared by the president of the united states barack obama in his speech on world aids day december 1 2011  on november 8 2011 united states secretary of state hillary rodham clinton had cited male circumcision as one of the key elements in achieving that goal in the fight against aids the ideal intervention is one that prevents people from being infected in the first place and the two methods ive describedmothertochild transmission voluntary medical male circumcisionare the most costeffective interventions we have and we are scaling them up  prepex is being used for nonsurgical adult male circumcision for hiv prevention in 16 priority countries in subsaharan africa with high hiv prevalence and as such the device is not yet available elsewhere  those 16 priority countries set by the who for vmmc include botswana central african republic ethiopia kenya lesotho malawi mozambique namibia rwanda south africa south sudan swaziland tanzania uganda zambia and zimbabwe  according to unaids 2013 global report on the aids epidemic as of december 2012 32 million african men had been circumcised through specific services for vmmc the intention of the prepex device is to accelerate scaleup of vmmc by providing men with an alternative to surgical circumcision and by relieving demands on the limited number of surgeons available in priority countries  the device is being scaled up in rwanda  and zimbabwe  following pilot studies that were funded by the bill  melinda gates foundation and pepfar other countries are in pilot stages and are expected to start scaleup of vmmc with prepex in the latter part of 2014 the prepex device was validated for safety and efficacy by the government of rwanda as detailed in the journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes jaids on september 8 2011  the study was reviewed onsite by who and gates foundation delegates a second study was designed to compare a new nonsurgical device with surgical mc to assess nonsurgical mc suitability for scaleup it used a randomized and controlled trial where the prepex device was compared to the dorsal slit method of circumcision focusing on adult males aged 2154 finding that the mean time for a nonsurgical prepex procedure was about 15 shorter in duration 31 minutes compared to 154 minutes   a third study examined the efficacy and of the prepex device when circumcision was performed by nurses finding that training was quick easy and sufficient to ensure effective procedures  male circumcision provides only partial protection and therefore should be only one element of a comprehensive hiv prevention package which includes the provision of hiv testing and counseling services treatment for sexuallytransmitted infections the promotion of safer sex practices the provision of male and female condoms and the promotion of their correct and consistent use  some studies have warned of caution being necessary when carrying out any scaleup of circumcision particularly warning newly circumcised males surgical or nonsurgical to refrain from sexual activity until the wounds are fully healed in addition that circumcised men might have a false sense of security that could lead to increased risky sexual behavior

V lateral patient air transfer is an industry that uses airbased systems to create safe patient handling and positioning the industry focuses on bariatric and fragile patient care hospital staff safety and hospital workers compensation air transfer products use an inflatable surface that forces a constant volume of air out from beneath it to break the plane of friction making the work of transferring patients safer for caregivers and patients lateral transfer aids come in many forms including air transfer sheets slide sheets and repositioningsheets applied above the bed linens or under the patient these frictionreducing devices help minimize the number of nurses required to reposition the patient in bed some lateral transfer aids are tubelike whereas others act like a pair of slick sheets in general theyre used without lifting devices and may take two nurses to apply most are applied only during the handling task but some can be left under the patient for up to a full day    traditionally draw sheets were used to transfer patients from bed to stretcher in 1984 the first airbased lateral patient transfer device was created in response to rising hospital workers compensation rates devised from a piece of plywood and a 50s ford headliner used as a pillow an industry was born and has evolved since then to bring new products to caregivers and patients more recent innovations include heatsealed rf welded seam construction as an option to stitched seams which can be potential bacteria accumulation points also disposable single patient use spu air transfer mattresses have been introduced which eliminate the need for frequent washing of the mattress products in the industry began as long airfilled mats that have progressed into several different versions with accessory products that assist in more than just the transfer of patients one of the newest innovations is an airfilled ramp that is placed on top of an air transfer system the basic idea of a ramp is to create threedimensional positioning for procedures when the patient is on the airtransfer system hospital staff can fill the ramp with air to lift the patients upper body and clear their airway which makes intubation easier on hospital staff during anesthetization the leading cause of back injuries in the health care field is patient transfer the repetitive task of lifting and handling patients from one spot to another creates a relatively high incidence of musculoskeletal disorders msd the bureau of labor statistics reports that healthcare workers occupy six of the top ten occupations at highest risk for back injuries with the use of an airtransfer system only two hospital staff members are needed to transfer a patient versus four or more the weight is much lighter on the staff and patients are moved without jerking or rolling as they were when draw sheets were used to transfer patients airbased transfer systems were created in response to rising hospital workers compensation rates hospitals attempt to remedy the rising rates by providing an environment where staff members do not need to worry about workplace injuries the leading cause of back injuries in the healthcare field is patient transfer and airbased systems eliminate this issue therefore reducing the need for workers compensation and lowering the rates obesity has become a national health and economic crisis in the united states and many countries in europe statistics showing the everincreasing prevalence of obesity in the last decade create implications for the healthcare system in addition to the direct weightrelated medical morbidities of obesity hospitals face practical problems  how to care for transport and move patients with severe obesity in the past hospital staff members have had to go as far as to wake up a patient in the operating room for a patient to assist in their own positioning with the increasing prevalence of severe obesity hospitals face growing concerns of both patient and personnel safety in the transfer and care of patients hospitals continue to focus on this problem with the ultimate goal of providing aids to patient mobilization such that patient care personnel need not be concerned about workplace injury and patient safety is maximized concerns about safety in the workplace both for the staff as well as the patient have stimulated an interest in various modes of patient mobilization along with airbased transfer systems there are many different options including swiveling floor boards swiveling cushions handling belts lateral transfer devices convertible or stretcher chairs and floor or ceilingmounted patient lifts to aid different types of patient mobilization such as layingtositting sittingtostanding and support while walking most lateral air transfers take place when moving a patient between a bed and a gurney or stretcher this for instance makes them ideal for moving patients from beds to stretchers and then to operating room tables for surgery here the patient remains in a supine position throughout the transfer process air transfer mats are generally too large and bulky to be used with transfer chairs stretchers that can be adjusted to convert to mobile chairs therefore patients cannot be transferred to wheelchairlike devices using air transfer mats nurses and caregivers must use slinglifts see patient lift or do a stand and pivot transfer manually or with a sittostand lift to move patients from the bed to wheelchairs or mobile chairs air transfer mats also require a powerful blower air pump to provide air pressure to the transfer mat this blower requires electrical power usually a wall outlet and can create considerable noise during patient transfer

V a cochlear implant ci is a surgically implanted electronic device that provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing cochlear implants may help provide hearing in patients who are deaf because of damage to sensory hair cells in their cochleas these sensory cells never regenerate unlike most cells in the body cochlear implants replace the input of those lost or damaged hair cells to replicate the different frequencies and amplitudes of sound implants can augment hearing sufficiently to improve understanding of speech and environmental sounds although the quality of sound is different from natural hearing and the input subject to different neural regulation newer devices and processing strategies allow recipients to hear better in noise enjoy music and even use their implant processors while swimming as of december 2012 approximately 324000 people worldwide have surgically implanted cochlear implants in the us roughly 58000 adults and 38000 children are recipients  some recipients have bilateral implants to allow for stereo sound however barriers such as the cost of the device prevent many patients from acquiring the device longterm auditory therapy following implantation is often required for patients to accurately interpret the soundwaves from the device   any history of the cochlear implant must start with an overview  of nonsurgical treatments proposed in the eighteenth century to overcome the social and psychological consequences of total neonatal deafness the story begins in the early eighteenth century although the frenchman abb de lpe   17121759 did not actually invent sign language he did at least bring together the results of various experiences notably those in spain before standardizing and teaching this method with the aim of facilitating communication among all those who practise it whether deaf or not abb de lpe was the first to use sign language to promote the mental development and education of deaf children in the middle of the eighteenth century he created a free public school which survived the french revolution and was perpetuated by the nascent republic in the form of the national institute for deafmutes institution nationale des sourdsmuets this institute now called the national institute for young deaf people institution nationale des jeunes sourds has always been located in rue st jacques paris for many years it was recognized internationally as a leader in the education of deaf children but its teachers and physicians disagreed on certain teaching methods the teachers tended to prefer oralisation difficult owing to the lack of sensory feedback while the physicians notably prosper menire and edouard fourni opted for sign language in fact this disagreement concerned not only communication itself but also the very place of deaf people in society sign language favored the teaching and development of deaf people within their own community while oralisation sought to integrate deaf people into the rest of society towards the end of the 19th century the development of international transport and the ent ear nose and throat medical discipline internationalized the debate early cochlear implants in adolescents and adults who had been deaf since birth met with failure often abandoned by their users these failures largely accounted for the widespread opposition of the deaf community to this new therapeutic approach animal experiments  subsequently showed that the auditory system could mature with chronic cochlear implant stimulation  but only if they started to be stimulated within an early period after birth  early cochlear implantation in children and the corresponding maturational processes ignited in their brains support such concept  electrical stimulation of afferent auditory pathways became feasible in the last half of the twentieth century chronologically its development can be divided into three periods in 1961 g von bekesy 18991972 received the nobel prize for demonstrating that sounds trigger vibrations of the basilar membrane which spread from the base to the apex of the cochlea in the form of longitudinal waves peaks occur at various points depending on the frequency resembling the keys of a piano with low frequencies towards the apex and high frequencies towards the oval window the terms cochlear keyboard and cochlear tonotopy are often used to describe these phenomena in 1968 h davis described the physiology of auditory receptors  in 1972 ny kiang unraveled the physiology of electrical stimulation of the inner ear  in 1975 ef evans showed that each sensory afferent fiber of the cochlear nerve handles a specific frequency making it electively sensitive to a very narrow frequency band  in 1957 a djourno a parisian professor of medical physics and c eyries a parisian otologist restored hearing to a deaf patient with total bilateral cholesteatomas by electrically stimulating acoustic nerve fibers still present in the inner ear this result was fortuitous however djourno and eyries had in fact been seeking to remobilize the frozen facial traits of a patient with cholesteatomas in both ears which had been complicated probably many years previously by bilateral facial paralysis they failed in their primary goal but had the wherewithal to record their electroacoustic observations over several weeks and to publish them in the french journal presse mdicale  they stopped their experiment when the apparatus broke down after less than a month if these french researchers had not noted their unexpected findings william house might never have dared try to compensate total deafness which is all the more severe when bilateral in 1961 a patient gave william house  a californian otologist a copy of a los angeles times article  describing the work of the paris researchers house had already transformed the functional outcome of cerebellopontine angle surgery by making use of the first surgical microscopes developed in the late 1950s and was familiar with total deafness he resumed his research basing his indications on what was known at the time about the physiology of hearing a rapidly progressing field at least in animals house standardized the surgical procedure and stably positioned the stimulatory electrode by threading it through the round window in the cochlear channel he encountered a number of difficulties especially in sealing the implant solutions emerged with the advent of pacemakers but it took house almost ten years to develop a singlechannel cochlear implant this ultimately robust and simple device stimulated the whole set of the auditory nerve fibers simultaneously meaning that the recipient was able to recognize only the rhythms of the speech house marketed his device jointly with j urban  and continued to implant it until at least 1965 the system was sufficiently reliable for researchers and otologists to overlook its mediocre functional performance in 1966 b simmons palo alto ca  performed the first temporary human implantation of a multichannel system in the trunk of the auditory nerve itself in a deaf volunteer this experimental work showed that stimulation of limited quotas of the auditory nerve fibers generated sensations of different frequencies depending on the origin of the stimulated fibers on the cochlear keyboard shortly afterwards mr merzenich ucsf  san francisco  confirmed these findings in macaques using a different approach in 1967 g clark in melbourne  created a team to conduct basic research on the pathophysiology of profound deafness in animals and on the tolerability of implanted materials in 1973 r michelson ucsf  san francisco  chronically implanted a deaf man with an experimental multichannel implant this device used pairs of antennas for each channel one transmitting and one receiving it was possible to measure several parameters and to test various types of stimulation including both bipolar and unipolar in 1973 ch chouard had extensive personal experience of petrous bone surgery involving the vestibular and facial nerves   together with p macleod a close friend specializing in sensory physiology chouard decided to create a multidisciplinary team at the ent research laboratory of stantoine teaching hospital in paris  in 1975 the two men showed in several patients with total unilateral traumatic deafness and facial paralysis  that electrical stimulation of 8 to 12 electrodes isolated from one another and placed in different parts of the scala tympani allowed the recipients to perceive different frequencies then having developed a test to ensure that auditory fibers were still present and functional based on electrical stimulation of the round window the paris team implanted their electrodes in patients with longstanding total bilateral deafness after a relatively brief period of postoperative speech therapy all the patients were able to recognize a variable percentage of words without lipreading  under the scientific direction of p mac leod industrial production of an implantable functional device was entrusted to the bertin a french company a tabletop prototype was quickly built but the untimely death of jean bertin in late 1975 led to restructuring of the company and it was only in the summer of 1976 that the french researchers finally received the first 6 devices in the meantime other french teams launched their own research programs particularly in the area of the electrodes bearer but they were forced to abandon their efforts    in 1975 k burian  in vienna building on the long tradition of the viennese ent school launched the development of the first austrian implant his work on singlechannel intra and extracochlear stimulation and then on multichannel stimulation was pursued by his pupil i hochmairdesoyer and her husband professor hochmair of innsbruck their work culminated in 1982 with the austrian medel implant the first implant took place at saintantoine hospital paris on wednesday 22 september 1976 it was performed by ch chouard assisted by bernard meyer the patient recovered his hearing the following day and another 5 patients were quickly implanted despite the bulky nature of the transmitter on 16 march 1977 bertin filed patent no 7707824 based on the physiological criteria of macleod and making two simultaneous claims 1 sequential transmission to the cochlea of an indeterminate number of frequency bands and 2 transmission of all the sound information the first results were presented at the xith world ent conference in buenos aires and were quickly published   for nearly twenty years this document influenced all the procedures and approaches used by other international teams who were obliged to find ways around the patent claims usually by opting to transmit only a portion of the speech information until the patent fell into the public domain in 1997 on 3 november 1977 the team of g clark australia filed a patent for a system with three functional electrodes but using only a limited part of the speech information voicing and one of the two formants of the vowels in 1975 ingeborg and erwin hochmair started cochlear implant development at the technical university of vienna 1977 the worlds first microelectronic multichannel cochlear implant developed by ingeborg and erwin hochmair was implanted in vienna by prof kurt burian 1924  1996 the implant had 8 channels a stimulation rate of 10000 pulses per second per channel and 8 independent current sources and flexible electrode for 2225mm insertion into the cochlea prof kurt burian inserted the flexible electrode through the round window into the scala tympani  in december 1977 the austrian team implanted a multichannel system with sufficient flexibility to study responses to various manipulations of the sound signal  september 1978 saw the first international teaching seminar on cochlear implants held in paris and attended by representatives of the other three involved countries namely i hochmairdesoyer and e hochmair austria j patrick australia r michelson and r schindler usa in 1978 graeme clark australia implanted his first patient  in fall of 1979 a patient implanted in august 1979 with a device by ingeborg and erwin hochmair received a small body worn speech processor it was modified in march 1980 at which time the patient became the first person to show open set speech understanding without lipreading using a portable processor  in 1982 ch chouard employing the born reconstruction technique which he had previously used in his neuroanatomical research together with c eyries  was the first to demonstrate in animals  the need for early implantation to avoid the atrophy of the central auditory structures that occurs very rapidly in case of persistent neonatal deafness in 1982 the new bertin device chorimac 12 was presented it had 12 electrodes and a smaller transmitter but was still much larger than the australian and austrian devices a few years later after announcing the arrival of the alldigital device  that chouard and macleod had been demanding since 1980 bertin abandoned the field and sold its license to another french company mxmneurelec in 1987 bertin filed for bankruptcy in 1998 in 1983 the 2nd international conference on cochlear implants was held in the former paris faculty of medicine just before the annual meeting of the international ent collegium orlas in 1984 the us food and drug administration approved the australian implant for use in adults in 1985 the australians improved on their original device35 which now transmitted all the vowel information  in 1990 the us food and drug administration approved the australian implant for young children in 1990 ingeborg and erwin hochmair started their company medel based in innsbruck austria and hired their first employees one year later the company presented the worlds first behindtheear audio processor  in 1991 mxmneurelec presented their first multichannel implant based on the bertin license it was fully digitized and could be adapted to an ossified cochlea  from 1992 onwards the multichannel cochlear implant gradually gained acceptance in france other teams first in montpellier   and toulouse begin to implant it at the same time the sound processing strategy used by the different cochlear implants gradually adopted technology resembling that described in the bertin patent delivering all the sound information in a sequential manner the american implant too provided the entire information in this way while avoiding falling foul of the french patent by employing a few clever tricks and restrictions the australian device was also improved providing all the sound information but retaining only the channels containing the maximum energy this restriction also avoided the bertin patent claims  in 1994 medel presented the worlds first electrode array capable of stimulating the entire length of the cochlea to allow a more natural hearing  in 1995 paris organized the 3rd international conference on cochlear implants  1996 medel presented the worlds first miniaturised multichannel implant 4mm thin and also had the first bilateral implantation for the purpose of binaural hearing  in 1997 the french license was blatantly copied leading to bertin to bring a lawsuit with seizure of the apparatus in question this was just before the patent fell into the public domain however the charges were quickly dropped following protests in some surgical centers in addition the cost of the legal proceedings far exceeded any financial retribution the company could expect to obtain  all manufacturers have since applied the principles of the bertin patent defined by p mac leod and ch chouard  following the french national ethics committees  approval of screening in the early neonatal period and the tercentenary of the work of abbe de lpe  celebrated in 2012 at the initiative of legent the positions of the deaf and hearing communities in france have started to be reconciled in a cordial and respectful dialogue avoiding proselytism the two communities are striving to refine the criteria of choice between the cochlear implant and the use of sign language  both options are sometimes valid the implant is surgically placed under the skin behind the ear the basic parts of the device include a number of factors determine the degree of success to expect from the operation and the device itself cochlear implant centers determine implant candidacy on an individual basis and take into account a persons hearing history cause of hearing loss amount of residual hearing speech recognition ability health status and family commitment to aural habilitationrehabilitation a prime candidate is described as people with mild or moderate sensorineural hearing loss are generally not candidates for cochlear implantation their needs can often be met with hearing aids alone or hearing aids with an fm system after the implant is put into place sound no longer travels via the ear canal and middle ear but is picked up by a microphone and sent through the devices speech processor to the implants electrodes inside the cochlea thus most candidates have been diagnosed with a severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss the presence of auditory nerve fibers is essential to the functioning of the device if these are damaged to such an extent that they cannot receive electrical stimuli the implant will not work some individuals with severe auditory neuropathy may also benefit from cochlear implants postlingually deaf adults prelingually deaf children and postlingually hard of hearing people usually children who have lost hearing due to diseases such as cmv and meningitis form three distinct groups of potential users of cochlear implants with different needs and outcomes those who have lost their hearing as adults were the first group to find cochlear implants useful in regaining some comprehension of speech and other sounds the outcomes of individuals that have been deaf for a long period of time before implantation are sometimes astonishing although more variable the risk of surgery in the older patient must be weighed against the improvement in quality of life as the devices improve particularly the sound processor hardware and software the benefit is often judged to be worth the surgical risk particularly for the newly deaf elderly patient  another group of customers is parents of children born deaf who want to ensure that their children grow up with good spoken language skills the brain develops after birth and adapts its function to the sensory input absence of this has functional consequences for the brain and consequently congenitally deaf children who receive cochlear implants at a young age less than 2 years have better success with them than congenitally deaf children who first receive the implants at a later age  though the critical period for utilizing auditory information does not close completely until adolescence one doctor has said there is a time window during which they can get an implant and learn to speak from the ages of two to four that ability diminishes a little bit and by age nine there is zero chance that they will learn to speak properly so its really important that they get recognized and evaluated early  additionally there is another sensitive period for strong asymmetry in hearing that closes earlier in life in cases of early singlesided deafness or unilateral cochlear implantation the brain reorganizes towards the hearing ear and that puts the deaf ear into a disadvantage  consequently the benefit of a sequential second implantation on the deaf ear is critically dependent on the delay between implantations  periods of asymmetric hearing during early childhood should be avoided and therapy of deafness should be binaural the third group who will benefit substantially from cochlear implantation are postlingual subjects who have lost hearing a common cause is childhood meningitis young children under five years in these cases often make excellent progress after implantation because they have learned how to form sounds and only need to learn how to interpret the new information in their brains  by the end of 2008 the total number of cochlear implant recipients had grown to an estimated 150000 worldwide  a story in 2000 stated that one in ten deaf children in the united states had a cochlear implant and the projection was that the ratio would rise to one in three in ten years  mexico had performed 55 cochlear implant operations by the year 2000 berruecos 2000 taiwan and china announced an approximately 270 million order for cochlear implant devices for children in 2006 which are being paid for by major healthcare organization based in taipei these cochlear implants are a donation by the taiwanese organization   in india there are an estimated 1 million profoundly deaf children and about 5000 have cochlear implants this minuscule number is due to the high costs for the implant as well as subsequent therapy  the device is surgically implanted under a general anesthetic or local anesthetic without or with sedation  and the operation usually takes from 1 to 5 hours first a small area of the scalp directly behind the ear may be shaved and cleaned then an incision is made in the skin behind the ear and the surgeon drills into the mastoid bone creating a pocket for the receiverstimulator and then into the inner ear where the electrode array is inserted into the cochlea the patient normally goes home the same day or the day after the surgery although some cochlear implant recipients stay in the hospital for 1 to 2 days as with every medical procedure the surgery involves a certain amount of risk in this case the risks include skin infection onset of or change in tinnitus damage to the vestibular system and damage to facial nerves that can cause muscle weakness impaired facial sensation or in the worst cases facial paralysis there is also the risk of device failure usually where the incision does not heal properly this occurs in 2 of cases and the device must be removed  there is also a potential risk to lose the residual hearing the patient may have in the implanted ear because of the shaving of hair cells in the cochlea but the chances have decreased over time as a result some doctors advise singleear implantation saving the other ear in case a biological treatment becomes available in the future however with a careful surgical technique and a flexible electrode the residual hearing of the patient can be preserved ever since ingeborg hochmair and her husband erwin hochmair started their work this aspect has been one of the priorities  after 14 weeks of healing the wait is usually longer for children than adults the implant is activated by connecting an external sound processor to the internal device via a magnet initial results vary widely and postimplantation therapy is required as well as time for the brain to adapt to hearing new sounds in the case of congenitally deaf children audiological training and speech therapy typically continue for years though infants can become age appropriateable to speak and understand at the same level as a hearing child of the same age the participation of the childs family in working on spoken language development is considered to be even more important than therapy because the family can aid development by participating activelyand continuallyin the childs therapy making hearing and listening interesting talking about objects and actions and encouraging the child to make sounds and form words professionals trained to work with children who have received cochlear implants are a major part of the parentprofessional team when addressing the task of teaching children to use their hearing to develop speech and spoken language these professionals include but are not limited to some users audiologists and surgeons also report that when there is an ear infection causing fluid in the middle ear it can affect the cochlear implant leading to temporarily reduced hearing  the implant has a few effects unrelated to hearing manufacturers have cautioned against scuba diving due to the pressures involved but the depths found in normal recreational diving appear to be safe the external components generally need to be turned off and removed prior to swimming or showering unless manufacturers specified that the external components are water proof in most cases certain diagnostic tests such as magnetic resonance imaging mri cannot be used on patients with cochlear implants without first removing the small internal magnet an outpatient procedure usually performed with a local anesthetic but some implants are now fda approved for use with certain strengths of mri machine the company medel has tackled this issue and has launched in 2014 the implant synchrony pin users with this implant do not have to undergo multiple surgeries to remove and reinsert the magnet and consequently lose their hearing while the magnet is out to undergo a mri of up to 30 tesla common strength of mri nowadays  large amounts of static electricity can cause the devices memory to reset for this reason children with cochlear implants are also advised to avoid plastic playground slides  the electronic stimulation the implant creates appears to have a positive effect on the nerve tissue that surrounds it  in the united states medical costs run from us45000 to us125000  this includes evaluation the surgery itself hardware device hospitalization and rehabilitation some or all of this may be covered by health insurance in the united kingdom the nhs covers cochlear implants in full as does medicare in australia and the department of health  in ireland seguridad social in spain and israel and the ministry of health or acc depending on the cause of deafness in new zealand according to the us national institute on deafness and other communication disorders the estimated total cost is 60000 per person implanted  a study by johns hopkins university determined that for a threeyearold child who receives cochlear implants can save 30000 to 50000 in specialeducation costs for elementary and secondary schools as they are more likely to be mainstreamed in school and thus use fewer support services than similarly deaf children  a cochlear implant will not cure deafness but is a prosthetic substitute for hearing some recipients find them very effective others somewhat effective and some feel worse overall with the implant than without  on the other hand there are efficiency studies that show that unilateral implantation is highly cost efficient and that there is a decrease in the societal cost in comparison to nonimplanted children   for people already functional in spoken language who lose their hearing cochlear implants can be a great help in restoring functional comprehension of speech especially if they have only lost their hearing for a short time individuals who have acquired deafblindness loss of hearing and vision combined may find cochlear implants a radical improvement in their daily lives it may provide them with more information for safety communication balance orientation and mobility and promote interaction within their environment and with other people reducing isolation having more auditory information than they may be familiar with may provide them with sensory information that will help them become more independent british member of parliament jack ashley received a cochlear implant in 1994 at age 70 after 25 years of deafness and reported that he has no trouble speaking to people he knows whether one on one or even on the telephone although he might have difficulty with a new voice or with a busy conversation and still had to rely to some extent on lip reading he described the robotic sound of human voices perceived through the cochlear implant as a croaking dalek with laryngitis another recipient described the initial sounds as similar to radio static and voices as being cartoonish though after a year with the implant she said everything sounded right  even modern cochlear implants have at most 22 electrodes to replace the 16000 delicate hair cells that are used for normal hearing however the sound quality delivered by a cochlear implant is often good enough that many users do not have to rely on lip reading in quiet conditions in noisy conditions however speech understanding often remains poor  adults who have grown up deaf can find the implants ineffective or irritating this relates to the specific pathology of deafness and the time frame adults who are born with normal hearing and who have had normal hearing for their early years and who have then progressively lost their hearing tend to have better outcomes than adults who were born deaf this is due to the neural patterns laid down in the early years of life which are crucially important to speech perception cochlear implants cannot overcome such a problem some who were orally educated and used amplifying hearing aids have been more successful with cochlear implants as the perception of sound was maintained through use of the hearing aid daily exercises such as side by side tracking listening to audio books while reading a print book synthetic training and analytic training can improve the efficacy of an implant through practice  children without a working auditory nerve may be helped with a cochlear implant although the results may not be optimal patients without a viable auditory nerve are usually identified during the candidacy process fewer than 1 of deaf individuals have a missing or damaged auditory nerve which today can be treated with an auditory brainstem implant research published in 2005 has suggested that children and adults can benefit from bilateral cochlear implants in order to aid in sound localization and speech understanding  and a 2011 study indicated that the language skills of children with two implants were within the normal range for the age  efficacy of cochlear implantation in the setting of otosclerosis has been demonstrated  some effects of implantation are irreversible while the device promises to provide new sound information for a recipient the implantation process inevitably results in shaving of the hair cells within the cochlea  which can result in a permanent loss of some or all residual natural hearing however with flexible electrodes and the right surgical methods the hair cells can be preserved while recent improvements in implant technology and implantation techniques promise to minimize such damage the risk and extent of damage still varies the goal of new implantation techniques is to reduce the risk of infection operating time and complications while improving the patients ability to hear such improvements of implantation techniques include preserving low frequency hearing and using minimal invasive surgery to better secure the device   still the cause of deafness is not always identified before the surgery it is possible but rare that the surgery does not restore hearing at all the united states food and drug administration reports that cochlear implant recipients may be at higher risk for meningitis  a study of 4265 american children who received implants between 1997 and 2002 concluded that recipient children had a risk of pneumococcal meningitis more than 30 times greater than that for children in the general population  a later ukbased study found that while the incidence of meningitis in implanted adults was significantly higher than the general population the incidence in children was no different from the general population  as a result the centers for disease control and prevention and the food and drug administration both recommend that wouldbe implant recipients be vaccinated against meningitis prior to surgery  rarely necrosis has been observed in the skin flaps surrounding cochlear implants   hyperbaric oxygen has been shown to be a useful adjunctive therapy in the management of cochlear implant flap necrosis  as the location of the cochlea is close to the facial nerve there is a risk that the nerve may be damaged during the operation the incidence of the damage is infrequent  there are strict protocols in choosing candidates to avoid risks and disadvantages a battery of tests is performed to make the decision of candidacy easier for example some patients suffer from deafness medial to the cochlea  typically vestibular schwannomas implantation into the cochlea has a low success rate with these people as the artificial signal does not have a healthy nerve to travel along historically patients with severe congenital anatomic anomalies of the cochlea were considered poor candidates for cochlear implantation many studies since the 1980s have demonstrated successful hearing outcomes after ci in this group blake papsin et al in 2005 published the largest series of patients with cochleovestibular anomalies undergoing implantation and found no significant difference in outcomes versus patients with normal anatomy  michael pakdaman et al in 2012 presented a systematic review of studies reviewing cochlear implantation in anomalous inner ears and found increased surgical difficulty and lower speech perception among patients with more severe inner ear dysplasia  with careful selection of candidates the risks of implantation are minimized the implant works by using the tonotopic organization of the basilar membrane of the inner ear tonotopic organization also referred to as a frequencytoplace mapping is the way the ear sorts out different frequencies so that our brain can process that information in a normal ear sound vibrations in the air lead to resonant vibrations of the basilar membrane inside the cochlea highfrequency sounds ie high pitched sounds do not pass very far along the membrane but low frequency sounds pass farther in the movement of hair cells located all along the basilar membrane creates an electrical disturbance that can be picked up by the surrounding nerve cells the brain is able to interpret the nerve activity to determine which area of the basilar membrane is resonating and therefore what sound frequency is being heard in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss hair cells are often fewer in number andor damaged hair cell loss or absence may be caused by a genetic mutation or an illness such as meningitis hair cells may also be destroyed chemically by an ototoxic medication or simply damaged over time by excessively loud noises the cochlear implant bypasses the hair cells and stimulates the cochlear nerves directly using electrical impulses this allows the brain to interpret the frequency of sound as it would if the hair cells of the basilar membrane were functioning properly see above sound received by the microphone must next be processed to determine how the electrodes should be activated filterbank strategies use fast fourier transforms ffts to divide the signal into different frequency bands the algorithm chooses a number of the strongest outputs from the filters the exact number depending on the number of implanted electrodes and other factors these strategies emphasize transmission of the spectral aspects of speech although coarse temporal information is presented the fine timing aspects are as yet poorly perceived and this is the focus of much current research feature extraction strategies use features which are common to all vowels each vowel has a fundamental frequency the lowest frequency peak and formants peaks with higher frequencies the pattern of the fundamental and formant frequencies is specific for different vowel sounds these algorithms try to recognize the vowel and then emphasize its features these strategies emphasize the transmission of spectral aspects of speech feature extraction strategies are no longer widely used cochlear implant manufacturer use various coding strategies cochlear americas for example uses the speakace strategy ace is mainly used in which number of maxima n from the available maxima in sound are selected advanced bionics uses other techniques like cis sas hires and fidelity 120 which stimulate the full spectrum the processing strategy is a main block upon which one has to choose the implant manufacturer research shows that patients can understand speech with at least 4 electrodes but a greater obstacle is in music perception where it returns that fine structure stimulation is an important issue some strategies used in advanced bionics and medel devices make use of fine structure presentation by implementing the hilbert transform in the signal processing path while ace strategies depends mainly on the short time fourier transform this is used to transmit the processed sound information over a radio frequency link to the internal portion of the device radio frequency is used so that no physical connection is needed which reduces the chance of infection and pain the transmitter attaches to the receiver using a magnet that holds through the skin this component receives directions from the speech processor by way of magnetic induction sent from the transmitter the receiver also receives its power through the transmission the receiver is also a sophisticated computer that translates the processed sound information and controls the electric current sent to the electrodes in the cochlea it is embedded in the skull behind the ear the electrode array is made from a type of silicone rubber while the electrodes are platinum or a similar highly conductive material it is connected to the internal receiver on one end and inserted into the cochlea deeper in the skull the cochlea winds its way around the auditory nerve which is tonotopically organized as is the basilar membrane when an electric current is routed to an intracochlear electrode an electrical field is generated and auditory nerve fibers are stimulated in the devices manufactured by cochlear ltd two electrodes sit outside the cochlea and act as groundsone is a ball electrode that sits beneath the skin while the other is a plate on the device this equates to 24 electrodes in the cochlearbrand nucleus device 22 array electrodes within the cochlea and 2 extracochlear electrodes insertion depth is another important consideration the mean length of the human cochlea is 3336 millimetres 1314in due to some physical limitation the implants do not reach to the apical tip when inserted but it may reach up to 25 millimetres 098in which corresponds to a tonotopical frequency of 4006000hz medel produces long electrode arrays that can be inserted up to a tonotopical frequency of 100hz according to greenwood frequency to position formula in normal hearing but the distance between the electrodes is about 25 millimetres 0098in while in the nucleus freedom from cochlear ltd it is about 07 millimetres 0028in there is strong research in this direction and the best sounding implant can be subjective from patient to patient speech processors are the components of the cochlear implant that transforms the sounds picked up by the microphone into electronic signals capable of being transmitted to the internal receiver the coding strategies programmed by the users audiologist are stored in the processor where it codes the sound accordingly the signal produced by the speech processor is sent through the coil to the internal receiver where it is picked up by radio signal and sent along the electrode array in the cochlea there are primarily two forms of speech processors available the most common kind is called the behindtheear processor or bte it is a small processor that is worn on the ear typically together with the microphone this is the kind of processor used by most adults and older children babies and small children wear either a baby bte pinned or clipped to the collar or the bodyworn processor which was more common in previous years todays tiny processors can often take the place of bulky bodyworn processors medel and cochlear brands both carry a baby bte configurations medel launched in 2013 the worlds first single unit processor which is attached through magnet to the implant and leaves the ear completely free the audiologist sets the minimum and maximum current level outputs for each electrode in the array based on the users reports of loudness the audiologist also selects the appropriate speech processing strategy and program parameters for the user professor graeme clark ac of la trobe university melbourne australia in 2008 announced the beginning of the development of a prototype hi fi cochlear implant featuring 50 electrodes it is hoped that the increased number of electrodes will enable users to perceive music and discern specific voices in noisy rooms  researchers at northwestern university have used infrared lasers to directly stimulate the neurons in the inner ear of deaf guinea pigs while recording electrical activity in the inferior colliculus an area of the midbrain that acts as a bridge between the inner ear and the auditory cortex the laser stimulation produced more precise signals in that brain region than the electrical stimulation commonly used in cochlear implants  laser stimulation is a promising technology for improving the auditory resolution of implants but further research using fiber optics to stimulate the neurons of the inner ear is required before products using the technology can be developed cochlear implants are rarely used in ears that have a functional level of residual hearing however electric acoustic stimulation eas devices including the hybrid shortelectrode cochlear implant have been developed that combine a cochlear implant with a sound amplifying hearing aid   eas devices have the potential to make cochlear implants suitable for many people with partial hearing loss the sound amplifying component helps users to perceive lower frequency sounds through their residual natural hearing while the cochlear implant allows them to hear middle and higher frequency sounds the combination enhances speech perception in noisy environments  additionally work is being done to develop a fully internal cochlear implant as of april 2011 four people have undergone a trial of an internal microphone system with two more yet to come  currently as of 2013  the three cochlear implant devices approved for use in the us are manufactured by cochlear limited australia advanced bionics usa a division of sonova and medel austria in europe africa asia south america and canada an additional device manufactured by neurelec france a division of william demant is available a device made by nurotron china is also available in some parts of the world each manufacturer has adapted some of the successful innovations of the other companies to its own devices there is no consensus that any one of these implants is superior to the others users of all devices report a wide range of performance after implantation since the devices have a similar range of outcomes other criteria are often considered when choosing a cochlear implant fm system compatibility usability of external components cosmetic factors battery life reliability of the internal and external components mri compatibility mapping strategies customer service from the manufacturer the familiarity of the users surgeon and audiologist with the particular device and anatomical concerns there have been reports of other organizations working to develop cochlear implants in india by a branch of the defence research and development organisation  which is expected to reach the clinical trial stage around september 2012  and in south korea by the seoul national university hospital  much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the deaf community which consists largely of prelingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language for some in the deaf community cochlear implants are an affront to their culture which as they view it is a minority threatened by the hearing majority  this is an old problem for the deaf community going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs oralism this is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the normal body in the 19th century when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated  despite the cochlear implant being justified from a medical perspective it is also important to consider the sociocultural context particularly in regards to the deaf community which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture  this accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture as many do not believe that deafness is something that needs to be cured however it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case the cochlear implant can act as a tool deaf people can use to access the hearing world without losing their deaf identity  cochlear implants for congenitally deaf children are considered to be most effective when implanted at a young age during the critical period in which the brain is still learning to interpret sound  hence they are implanted before the recipients can decide for themselves on the assumption that deafness is a disability deaf culture critics argue that the cochlear implant and the subsequent therapy often become the focus of the childs identity at the expense of a possible future deaf identity and ease of communication in sign language and claim that measuring the childs success only by their mastery of hearing and speech will lead to a poor selfimage as disabled because the implants do not produce normal hearing rather than having the healthy selfconcept of a proudly deaf person  children with cochlear implants are more likely to be educated orally in the standard fashion and without access to sign language spencer et al 2003 they are often isolated from other deaf children and from sign language spencer 2003 children do not always receive support in the educational system to fulfill their needs as they may require special education environments and educational assistants according to johnston 2004 cochlear implants have been one of the technological and social factors implicated in the decline of sign languages in the developed world some of the more extreme responses from deaf activists have labeled the widespread implantation of children as cultural genocide  andrew solomon of the new york times states that much national association of the deaf propaganda about the danger of implants is alarmist some of it is positively inaccurate  as the trend for cochlear implants in children grows deafcommunity advocates have tried to counter the either or formulation of oralism vs manualism with a both and approach some schools now are successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs

V in medicine a nebulizer  or nebuliser  see spelling differences is a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis asthma copd and other respiratory diseases analytical nebulizers are another form of nebulizer and are used primarily in laboratory settings for elemental analysis nebulizers use oxygen compressed air or ultrasonic power to break up medical solutions and suspensions into small aerosol droplets that can be directly inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device the definition of an aerosol is a mixture of gas and liquid particles and the best example of a naturally occurring aerosol is mist formed when small vaporized water particles mixed with hot ambient air are cooled down and condense into a fine cloud of visible airborne water droplets   various asthma guidelines such as the global initiative for asthma guidelines gina the british guidelines on the management of asthma the canadian pediatric asthma consensus guidelines and united states guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of asthma each recommend metered dose inhalers in place of nebulizerdelivered therapies  the european respiratory society acknowledge that although nebulizers are used in hospitals and at home they suggest much of this use may not be evidencebased  recent evidence show that nebulizers are no more effective than metereddose inhalers mdis with spacers and that mdis may offer advantages in children with acute asthma    those findings refer specifically to the treatment of asthma and not to the efficacy of nebulisers generally as for copd for example european respiratory society highlighted a risk relating to droplet size reproducibility caused by selling nebulizer devices separately from nebulized solution they found this practice could vary droplet size 10fold or more by changing from an inefficient nebulizer system to a highly efficient one   two advantages attributed to nebulizers compared to mdis with spacers inhalers were their ability to deliver larger dosages at a faster rate especially in acute asthma however recent data suggests actual lung deposition rates are the same in addition another trial found that a mdi with spacer had a lower required dose for clinical result compared to a nebulizer see clark et al other references  the lung deposition characteristics and efficacy of an aerosol depend largely on the particle or droplet size generally the smaller the particle the greater its chance of peripheral penetration and retention however for very fine particles below 05m in diameter there is a chance of avoiding deposition altogether and being exhaled in 1966 the task group on lung dynamics concerned mainly with the hazards of inhalation of environmental toxins proposed a model for deposition of particles in the lung this suggested that particles of more than 10m in diameter are most likely to deposit in the mouth and throat for those of 510m diameter a transition from mouth to airway deposition occurs and particles smaller than 5m in diameter deposit more frequently in the lower airways and are appropriate for pharmaceutical aerosols  the medical company boehringer ingelheim also invented a new device named respimat soft mist inhaler in 1997 this new technology provides a metered dose to the user as the liquid bottom of the inhaler is rotated clockwise 180 degrees by hand adding a build up tension into a spring around the flexible liquid container when the user activates the bottom of the inhaler the energy from the spring is released and imposes pressure on the flexible liquid container causing liquid to spray out of 2 nozzles thus forming a soft mist to be inhaled the device features no gas propellant and no need for batterypower to operate the average droplet size in the mist was measured to a somewhat disappointing 58 micrometers which could indicate some potential efficiency problems for the inhaled medicine to reach the lungs subsequent trials have proven this was not the case due to the very low velocity of the mist the soft mist inhaler in fact has a higher efficiency compared to a conventional pmdi  in 2000 arguments were launched towards the european respiratory society ers to clarifyexpand their definition of a nebulizer as the new soft mist inhaler in technical terms both could be classified as a hand driven nebulizer and a hand driven pmdi  the humanpowered nebulizer hpn is designed to provide relief to patients suffering from respiratory diseases such as asthma tb or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in areas with limited access to electricity invented in 2009 by a team of doctors from marquette university hpn uses a bicycle frame and pedalseach connected to a piston and some tubingto turn liquid medicine into mist that flows directly into a patients lungs through an attached mouthpiece commercial nebulizers typically use an electric compressor to maintain their rate of airflow but with hpn healthcare workers achieve the same goal by pedaling the equivalent of 8 miles per hour  a new significant innovation was made in the nebulizer market around 2005 with creation of the ultrasonic vibrating mesh technology vmt with this technology a meshmembrane with 10007000 laser drilled holes vibrates at the top of the liquid reservoir and thereby pressures out a mist of very fine droplets through the holes this technology is more efficient than having a vibrating piezoelectric element at the bottom of the liquid reservoir and thereby shorter treatment times are also achieved the old problems found with the ultrasonic wave nebulizer having too much liquid waste and undesired heating of the medical liquid have also been solved by the new vibrating mesh nebulizers a partial list of available vmt nebulizers includes pari eflow  respironics ineb  beurer nebulizer ih50  and aerogen aeroneb  as the price of the ultrasonic vmt nebulizers carry a higher price compared to the previous models most of the manufacturers continue also to sell the more old fashioned jet nebulizer the most commonly used nebulizers are jet nebulizers which are also called atomizers  jet nebulizers are connected by tubing to a compressor that causes compressed air or oxygen to flow at high velocity through a liquid medicine to turn it into an aerosol which is then inhaled by the patient currently there seems to be a tendency among physicians to prefer prescription of a pressurized metered dose inhaler pmdi for their patients instead of a jet nebulizer that generates a lot more noise often 60db during use and is less portable due to a heavier weight however jet nebulizers are commonly used for patients in hospitals who have difficulty using inhalers such as in serious cases of respiratory disease or severe asthma attacks  the main advantage of the jet nebulizer is related to its low operational cost if the patient needs to inhale medicine on a daily basis the use of a pmdi can be rather expensive today several manufacturers have also managed to lower the weight of the jet nebulizer down to 635 grams 224oz and thereby started to label it as a portable device compared to all the competing inhalers and nebulizers the noise and heavy weight is however still the biggest draw back of the jet nebulizer ultrasonic wave nebulizers were invented in 1964  as a new type of portable nebulizer the technology inside an ultrasonic wave nebulizer is to have an electronic oscillator generate a high frequency ultrasonic wave which causes the mechanical vibration of a piezoelectric element this vibrating element is in contact with a liquid reservoir and its high frequency vibration is sufficient to produce a vapor mist  as they create aerosols from ultrasonic vibration instead of using a heavy air compressor they only have a weight around 170 grams 60oz another advantage is that the ultrasonic vibration is almost silent examples of these more modern type of nebulizers are omron neu17 and beurer nebulizer ih30  nebulizers accept their medicine in the form of a liquid solution which is often loaded into the device upon use corticosteroids and bronchodilators such as salbutamol albuterol usan are often used and sometimes in combination with ipratropium the reason these pharmaceuticals are inhaled instead of ingested is in order to target their effect to the respiratory tract which speeds onset of action of the medicine and reduces side effects compared to other alternative intake routes  usually the aerosolized medicine is inhaled through a tubelike mouthpiece similar to that of an inhaler the mouthpiece however is sometimes replaced with a face mask similar to that used for inhaled anesthesia for ease of use with young children or the elderly pediatric masks are often shaped like animals such as fish dogs or dragons to make children less resistant to nebulizer treatments many nebulizer manufacturers also offer pacifier attachments for infants and toddlers but mouthpieces are preferable if patients are able to use them since facemasks result in reduced lung delivery because of aerosol losses in the nose  after use with corticosteroid it is theoretically possible for patients to develop a yeast infection in the mouth thrush or hoarseness of voice dysphoniaalthough these conditions are clinically very rare to avoid these adverse effects some clinicians suggest that the person who used the nebulizer should rinse his or her mouth this is not true for bronchodilators however patients may still wish to rinse their mouths due to the unpleasant taste of some bronchodilating drugs the first powered or pressurized inhaler was invented in france by salesgirons in 1858  this device used pressure to atomize the liquid medication the pump handle is operated like a bicycle pump when the pump is pulled up it draws liquid from the reservoir and upon the force of the users hand the liquid is pressurized through an atomizer to be sprayed out for inhalation near the users mouth  in 1864 the first steamdriven nebulizer was invented in germany this inhaler known as siegles steam spray inhaler used the venturi principle to atomize liquid medication and this was the very beginning of nebulizer therapy the importance of droplet size was not yet understood so the efficacy of this first device was unfortunately mediocre for many of the medical compounds the siegle steam spray inhaler consisted of a spirit burner which boiled water in the reservoir into steam that could then flow across the top and into a tube suspended in the pharmaceutical solution the passage of steam drew the medicine into the vapor and the patient inhaled this vapor through a mouthpiece made of glass  the first electrical nebulizer was invented in the 1930s and called a pneumostat with this device a medical liquid typically adrenalin chloride used as a bronchial muscle relaxant to reverse contriction was made aerosol by the power from an electrical compressor  as an alternative to the expensive electrical nebulizer many people in the 1930s continued to use the much more simple and cheap handdriven nebulizer known as the parkedavis glaseptic  in 1956 a technology competing against the nebulizer was launched by riker laboratories 3m in the form of pressurized metereddose inhalers with medihaleriso isoprenaline and medihalerepi adrenaline as the two first products  in these devices the drug is coldfill and delivered in exact doses through some special metering valves driven by a gas propellant technology ie freon or a less environmentally damaging hfa  in 1964 a new type of electronic nebulizer was introduced the ultrasonic wave nebulizer  today the nebulizing technology is not only used for medical purposes ultrasonic wave nebulizers are also used in humidifiers to spray out water aerosols to moisten dry air in buildings  some of the first models of electronic cigarettes featured an ultrasonic wave nebulizer having a piezoelectric element vibrating and creating highfrequency ultrasound waves to cause vibration and atomization of liquid nicotine in combination with a vapouriser built as a spray nozzle with an electric heating element  the most common type of electronic cigarettes currently sold however omit the ultrasonic wave nebulizer as it was not found to be efficient enough for this kind of device instead the electronic cigarettes now use an electric vaporizer either in direct contact with the absorbent material in the impregnated atomizer or in combination with the nebulization technology related to a spraying jet atomizer in the form of liquid droplets being outsprayed by a highspeed air stream that passes through some small venturi injection channels drilled in a material absorbed with nicotine liquid

V gholam a peyman md recipient of national medal of technology and innovation the nations highest honor for technological achievement bestowed by the president of the united states president obama on americas leading innovators    and a hall of fame  of ophthalmology and retina surgeon who is also a prolific and successful inventor gholam peyman is a member of national academy of inventors and has thus far been granted 162 us patents  covering a broad range of novel medical devices intraocular drug delivery surgical techniques as well as new methods of diagnosis and treatment his most widely known invention to date is lasik eye surgery  a vision correction procedure designed to allow people to see clearly without glasses he was awarded the first us patent for the procedure in 1989 link to image of patent below in addition to the numerous other honors and awards he has received please see section 4 for publications and awards in 2005 he was selected by a ballot among the more than 30000 ophthalmologists around the world to become one of the thirteen living ophthalmologists inducted into the hall of fame of ophthalmology    peyman was born in jahrom iran at the age of 19 he moved to germany to begin his medical studies he received his md at the university of freiburg in 1962 he completed his internship at st johannes hospital in diusberg germany in 1964 and at passaic general hospital in passaic new jersey in 1965 peyman completed his residency in ophthalmology and a retina fellowship at the university of essen essen germany in 1969 and an additional postdoctoral fellowship in retina at the jules stein eye institute ucla school of medicine in los angeles in 1971 peyman held the position of assistant professor of ophthalmology at the ucla school of medicine from 1971 and served as associate professor and then professor of ophthalmology at the illinois eye and ear infirmary university of illinois at chicago during 19711987 peyman held a joint appointment

engineering at the university of arizona in tucson peyman was awarded in 2013 an honoree doctorate degree from the national university of cordoba in argentina  at the illinois eye and ear infirmary dr peyman because of his interest in the effects of lasers on tissues in the eye began evaluating the potential use of a co2 laser to modify corneal refraction in rabbits no prior study had existed on this concept the laser was applied to the surface of the cornea using different patterns this laser created significant scarring his conclusions at that time were 1 one has to wait for the development of an ablative laser and 2 one should not ablate the surface of the cornea but instead the ablation should take place under a flap in order to prevent scarring pain and other undesirable sequelae peyman published the first article on this subject in 1980  in late 1982 he read an article from ibm laboratories published in laser focus describing the photoablative properties of an excimer laser on organic material this was very exciting information but unfortunately peyman did not have access to this laser which at the time was new and very expensive by 1985 and beyond many investigators were interested in ablating the corneal surface however because of his previous experience with the co2 laser peyman wanted to avoid surface ablation in order to prevent potential corneal scarring and the pain associated with the removal of the corneal epithelium necessary to expose the surface of the cornea therefore in july 1985 he applied for a patent that described a method of modifying corneal refractive errors using laser ablation under a corneal flap this us patent was accepted after two revisions and issued in june 1989 peyman performed a number of experimental studies evaluating the effect of various excimer lasers in collaboration with physics department of the university of helsinki finland since he had purchased an erbyag laser in the us he evaluated the concept using this laser in vivo in rabbit and primate eyes and described the creation of a hinged corneal flap to enable the ablation to be performed on the exposed corneal bed thus reducing the potential for postoperative scarring and pain  always aware of the potential limitations of his invention peyman devoted considerable time and effort in subsequent years to ameliorating them in order to improve the riskbenefit considerations of the lasik procedure he invented and patented a broad range of ablative and nonablative inlays to be placed under the surgically created corneal flap these inlays offered many potential advantages over the standard lasik technique the most significant of which is that the inlay procedure is reversible  peymans inquiring mind coupled with his keen interest in engineering and pharmacology along with his indepth background and experience in ophthalmology resulted over a 42year period in a remarkable range of novel devices improvements in surgical methods and revolutionary new treatment methods and modalities a partial list of peymans most significant discoveries and inventions with first publication date many of which are still in use today includes eye wall resection tumors and biopsy glaucoma pressurecontrolled shunt development of the field of intraocular drug deliveryin the early 1970 peyman investigated the blood ocular barrier using peroxidase as a tracer material to image the site of the barrier in retina which prevented free diffusion of medication from blood in the eye because at that time despite the systemic antibiotics many eyes were lost after surgery or trauma due to infection he initiated the evaluation of direct intraocular drug delivery this method has now become an alternative route of drug administration to the systemic and topical medication that in majority of the cases do not cure the infection further investigations lead to the prophylactic or therapeutic intraocular administration of the nontoxic doses of numerous medications in the treatment of inflammatory and noninflammatory diseases of retina in millions of patients presently intraocular drug delivery is accepted and is performed routinely in the treatment

V a ventricular assist device vad is an electromechanical circulatory device that is used to partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart the function of vads differs from that of artificial cardiac pacemakers some vads are intended for short term use typically for patients recovering from heart attacks or heart surgery while others are intended for longterm use months to years and in some cases for life typically for patients suffering from advanced congestive heart failure vads are distinct from artificial hearts which are designed to completely take over cardiac function and generally require the removal of the patients heart vads are designed to assist either the right rvad or left lvad ventricle or both at once bivad the type that is used depends primarily on the underlying heart disease and the pulmonary arterial resistance that determines the load on the right ventricle lvads are most commonly used but when pulmonary arterial resistance is high right ventricular assistance may become necessary long term vads are normally used to keep patients alive with a good quality of life while they wait for a heart transplantation known as a bridge to transplantation however lvads are sometimes used as destination therapy meaning they will never undergo heart transplant and sometimes as a bridge to recovery   in the last few years vads have improved significantly in terms of providing survival and quality of life among recipients    the pumps used in vads can be divided into two main categories  pulsatile pumps that mimic the natural pulsing action of the heart and continuous flow pumps  pulsatile vads use positive displacement pumps in some of these pumps the volume occupied by blood varies during the pumping cycle and if the pump is contained inside the body then a vent tube to the outside air is required continuous flow vads are smaller and have proven to be more durable than pulsatile vads  they normally use either a centrifugal pump or an axial flow pump both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets which in turn cause the rotors to spin in the centrifugal pumps the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical causing the blood to be accelerated in the direction of the rotors axis  an important issue with continuous flow pumps is the method used to suspend the rotor early versions used solid bearings however newer pumps some of which are approved for use in the eu use either electromagnetic suspension maglev     or hydrodynamic suspension these pumps contain only one moving part  the first successful implantation of a left ventricular assist device was completed in 1966 by dr michael e debakey to a 37yearold woman a paracorporeal external circuit was able to provide mechanical support for 10 days after the surgery  the first successful longterm implantation of an artificial lvad was conducted in 1988 by dr william f bernhard of boston childrens hospital medical center and thermedics inc of woburn ma under a national institutes of health nih research contract which developed heartmate an electronically controlled assist device this was funded by a three year 62 million contract to thermedics and childrens hospital boston ma from the national heart and lung and blood institute a program of nih  the early vads emulated the heart by using a pulsatile action where blood is alternately sucked into the pump from the left ventricle then forced out into the aorta devices of this kind include the heartmate ip lvas which was approved for use in the us by the food and drug administration fda in october 1994 these devices are commonly referred to as first generation vads  more recent work has concentrated on continuous flow pumps which can be roughly categorized as either centrifugal pumps or axial flow impeller driven pumps these pumps have the advantage of greater simplicity resulting in smaller size and greater reliability these devices are referred to as second generation vads a side effect is that the user will not have a pulse or that the pulse intensity will be seriously reduced  third generation vads suspend the impeller in the pump using either hydrodynamic or electromagnetic suspension thus removing the need for bearings and reducing the number of moving parts to one  another technology undergoing clinical trials is the use of trans cutaneous induction to power and control the device rather than using percutaneous cables apart from the obvious cosmetic advantage this reduces the risk of infection and the consequent need to take preventative action a pulsatile pump using this technology has ce mark approval and is in clinical trials for us fda approval  a very different approach in the early stages of development is the use of an inflatable cuff around the aorta inflating the cuff contracts the aorta and deflating the cuff allows the aorta to expand  in effect the aorta becomes a second left ventricle a proposed refinement is to use the patients skeletal muscle driven by a pacemaker to power this device which would make it truly selfcontained however a similar operation cardiomyoplasty was tried in the 1990s with disappointing results in any case it has substantial potential advantages in avoiding the need to operate on the heart itself and in avoiding any contact between blood and the device this approach involves a return to a pulsatile flow  peter houghton was the longest surviving recipient of a vad for permanent use he received an experimental jarvik 2000 lvad in june 2000 since then he completed a 91mile charity walk published two books lectured widely hiked in the swiss alps and the american west flew in an ultralight aircraft and traveled extensively around the world he died of acute renal failure in 2007 at the age of 69   the majority of vads on the market today are somewhat bulky the smallest device approved by the fda the heartmate ii weighs about 1 pound 045kg and measures 3 inches 76cm this has proven particularly important for women and children for whom alternatives would have been too large  one device gained ce mark approval for use in the eu and began clinical trials in the us ventrassist as of june 2007 these pumps had been implanted in over 100 patients in 2009 ventracor was placed into the hands of administrators due to financial problems and was later that year liquidated no other companies purchased the technology so as a result the ventrassist device was essentially defunct around 3050 patients worldwide remain supported on ventrassist devices as of january 2010  the heartware hvad works similarly to the ventrassist  albeit much smaller and not requiring an abdominal pocket to be implanted into the device has obtained ce mark in europe and fda approval in the us recently it was shown that the heartware hvad can be implanted through limited access without sternotomy  in a small number of cases left ventricular assist devices combined with drug therapy have enabled the heart to recover sufficiently for the device to be able to be removed explanted   a series of studies involving the use of the of heartmate ii lvad have proven useful in establishing the viability and risks of using lvads for bridgetotransplantation and destination therapy the harefield recovery protocol study harps is a clinical trial to evaluate whether advanced heart failure patients requiring vad support can recover sufficient myocardial function to allow device removal known as explantation harps combines an lvad the heartmate xve with conventional oral heart failure medications followed by the novel \u03b22 agonist clenbuterol this opens the possibility that some advanced heart failure patients may forgo heart transplantation  to date 73 11 of 15 of patients who underwent the combination therapy regimen demonstrated sufficient recovery to allow explantation and avoid heart transplantation freedom from recurrent heart failure in surviving patients was 100 and 89 at one and four years after explantation respectively average ejection fraction was 64 at 59 months after explantation  all patients were nyha class i and no significant adverse effects were reported with clenbuterol therapy the rematch randomized evaluation of mechanical assistance for the treatment of congestive heart failure clinical trial began in may 1998 and ran through july 2001 in 20 cardiac transplant centers around the usa the trial was designed to compare longterm implantation of left ventricular assist devices with optimal medical management for patients with endstage heart failure who require but do not qualify to receive cardiac transplantation as a result of the clinical outcomes the device received fda approval for both indications in 2001 and 2003 respectively  the trial demonstrated an 81 improvement in twoyear survival among patients receiving heartmate xve compared to optimal medical management in addition a destination therapy study following the rematch trial demonstrated an additional 17 improvement 61 vs 52 in oneyear survival of patients that were implanted with a vad heartmate xve with an implication for the appropriate selection of candidates and timing of vad implantation a test carried out in 2001 by dr eric a rose and rematch study group with patients with congestive heart failure that were ineligible for a transplant showed a survival at two years of 23 for those implanted with an lvad compared with 8 for those who were treated with drugs the two major complications of vad implantation were infection and mechanical failure see below according to a retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated with a left ventricular assist device versus inotrope therapy while awaiting heart transplantation the group treated with lvad had improved clinical and metabolic function at the time of transplant with better blood pressure sodium blood urea nitrogen and creatinine after transplant 577 of the inotrope group had renal failure versus 166 in the lvad group 316 of the inotrope group had right heart failure versus 56 in the lvad group and eventfree survival was 158 in the inotrope group versus 556 in the lvad group  bleeding is the most common postoperative early complication after implantation or explantation of lvads necessitating reoperation in up to 60 of recipients   the implications of massive blood transfusions are great and include infection pulmonary insufficiency increased costs right heart failure allosensitization and viral transmission some of which can prove fatal or preclude transplantation  when bleeding occurs it impacts the one year kaplanmeier mortality  in addition to complexity of the patient population and the complexity of these procedures contributing to bleeding the devices themselves may contribute to the severe coagulopathy that can ensue when these devices are implanted  critical in the management of bleeding in the early hours after implantation or explantation is to adequately evacuate the postsurgical blood from around the heart and lungs to prevent retained blood from contributing to the need for reoperation to wash out clot that can compress the device features and contribute to post operative shock preventing chest tube clogging during this period is critical to recovery  because the devices generally result in blood flowing over a nonbiologic surface predisposing the blood to clotting there is need for anticoagulation measures one device the heartmate xve is designed with a biologic surface derived from fibrin and does not require long term anticoagulation except aspirin unfortunately this biologic surface may also predispose the patient to infection through selective reduction of certain types of leukocytes  new vad designs which are now approved for use in the european community and are undergoing trials for fda approval have all but eliminated mechanical failure  vadrelated infection can be caused by a large number of different organisms  treatment of vadrelated infection is exceedingly difficult and many patients die of infection despite optimal treatment initial treatment should be with broad spectrum antibiotics but every effort must be made to obtain appropriate samples for culture a final decision regarding antibiotic therapy must be based on the results of microbiogical cultures  other problems include immunosuppression clotting with resultant stroke and bleeding secondary to anticoagulation some of the polyurethane components used in the devices cause the deletion of a subset of immune cells when blood comes in contact with them this predisposes the patient to fungal and some viral infections necessitating appropriate prophylactic therapy  considering the multitude of risks and lifestyle modifications associated with ventricular assist device implant  it is important for prospective patients to be informed prior to decision making  in addition to physician consult various internetbased patient directed resources are available to assist in patient education   this is a partial list and may never be completereferenced additions are welcome

V a hypodermic needle from greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf under and \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 skin is a hollow needle commonly used with a syringe to inject substances into the body or extract fluids from it they may also be used to take liquid samples from the body for example taking blood from a vein in venipuncture large bore hypodermic intervention is especially useful in catastrophic blood loss or shock a hypodermic needle is used for rapid delivery of liquids or when the injected substance cannot be ingested either because it would not be absorbed as with insulin or because it would harm the liver there are many possible routes for an injection the hypodermic needle also serves an important role in research environments where sterile conditions are required the hypodermic needle significantly reduces contamination during inoculation of a sterile substrate the hypodermic needle reduces contamination for two reasons first its surface is extremely smooth which prevents airborne pathogens from becoming trapped between irregularities on the needles surface which would subsequently be transferred into the media eg agar as contaminants second the needles surface is extremely sharp which significantly reduces the diameter of the hole remaining after puncturing the membrane which consequently prevents microbes larger than this hole from contaminating the substrate       the ancient greeks and romans knew injection as a method of medicinal delivery from observations of snakebites and poisoned weapons  there are also references to anointing and inunction in the old testament as well as the works of homer but injection as a legitimate medical tool was not truly explored until the 17th century  christopher wren performed the earliest confirmed experiments with crude hypodermic needles performing intravenous injection into dogs in 1656  these experiments consisted of using animal bladders as the syringe and goose quills as the needle to administer drugs such as opium intravenously to dogs wren and others main interest was to learn if medicines traditionally administered orally would be effective intravenously in the 1660s jd major of kiel and js elsholtz of berlin were the first to experiment with injections in humans   these early experiments were generally ineffective and in some cases fatal injection fell out of favor for two centuries the 19th century saw the development of medicines that were effective in small doses such as opiates and strychnine this spurred a renewed interest in direct controlled application of medicine some controversy surrounds the question of priority in hypodermic medication  dr francis rynd is generally credited with the first successful injection in 1844  dr alexander woods main contribution was the allglass syringe in 1851 which allowed the user to estimate dosage based on the levels of liquid observed through the glass  wood used hypodermic needles and syringes primarily for the application of localized subcutaneous injection localized anesthesia and therefore was not as interested in precise dosages  simultaneous to woods work in edinburgh dr charles pravaz of lyon also experimented with subdermal injections in sheep using a syringe of his own design pravaz designed a syringe measuring 3cm 118in long and 5mm 02in in diameter it was made entirely of silver  dr charles hunter a london surgeon is credited with the coining of the term hypodermic to describe subcutaneous injection in 1858 the name originates from two greek words hypo under and derma skin furthermore hunter is widely credited with acknowledging the systemic effects of injection after noticing that a patients pain was alleviated regardless of the injections proximity to the pained area   hunter and wood were involved in lengthy legal disputes over not only the origin of the modern hypodermic needle but also because of their disagreement to the medicines effect once administered wood can be largely credited with the popularization and acceptance of injection as a medical technique as well as the widespread use and acceptance of the hypodermic needle the basic technology of the hypodermic needle has stayed largely unchanged since the 19th century but as the years progressed and medical and chemical knowledge improved small refinements have been made to increase safety and efficacy with needles being designed and tailored for very particular uses the trend of needle specification for use began in the 1920s particularly for the administration of insulin to diabetics  the onset of world war ii spurred the early development of partially disposable syringes for the administration of morphine and penicillin on the battlefield development of the fully disposable hypodermic needle was spurred on in the 1950s for several reasons the korean war created blood shortages and in response disposable sterile syringes were developed for collecting blood the widespread immunization against polio during the period required the development of a fully disposable syringe system   the 1950s also saw the rise and recognition of crosscontamination from used needles this led to the development of the first fully disposable plastic syringe by new zealand pharmacist colin murdoch in 1956  this period also marked a shift in interest from needle specifications to general sterility and safety the 1980s saw the rise of the hiv epidemic and with it renewed concern over the safety of crosscontamination from used needles new safety controls were designed on disposable needles to ensure the safety of medical workers in particular these controls were implemented on the needles themselves such as retractable needles but also in the handling of used needles particularly in the use of hardsurface disposal receptacles found in every medical office today   hypodermic needles are normally made from a stainlesssteel tube  through a process known as tube drawing where the tube is drawn through progressively smaller dies to make the needle the end is bevelled to create a sharp pointed tip letting the needle easily penetrate the skin the diameter of the needle is indicated by the needle gauge various needle lengths are available for any given gauge there are a number of systems for gauging needles including the stubs needle gauge and the french catheter scale needles in common medical use range from 7 gauge the largest to 33 the smallest on the stubs scale 21gauge needles are most commonly used for drawing blood for testing purposes and 16 or 17gauge needles are most commonly used for blood donation as the resulting lower pressure is less harmful to red blood cells it also allows more blood to be collected in a shorter time  although reusable needles remain useful for some scientific applications disposable needles are far more common in medicine disposable needles are embedded in a plastic or aluminium hub that attaches to the syringe barrel by means of a pressfit or twiston fitting these are sometimes referred to as luer lock connections referring to the trademark luerlok hypodermic needles are usually used by medical professionals dentists phlebotomists physicians nurses paramedics but they are sometimes used by patients themselves this is most common with type one diabetics who may require several insulin injections a day  it also occurs with patients who have asthma or other severe allergies such patients may need to take desensitization injections or they may need to carry injectable medicines to use for first aid in case of a severe allergic reaction in the latter case such patients often carry a syringe loaded with epinephrine eg epipen  diphenhydramine eg benadryl or dexamethasone although sometimes disconcerting to spectators rapid injection of one of these drugs may stop a severe allergic reaction multiple sclerosis patients may also treat themselves by injection several ms therapies including various interferon preparations are designed to be selfadministered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection  in some countries erectile dysfunction patients may be prescribed alprostadil in injectable form which is selfinjected directly into the base or side of the penis with a very fine hypodermic needle femaletomale transsexuals often use hypodermic needles for selfinjection of prescription testosterone maletofemale transsexuals may also use hypodermic needles for selfinjection of \u0153strogen hypodermic needles are also used in recreational intravenous drug use before governments attained current levels of awareness about the spread of disease through shared needles hypodermic syringes in many countries were available only by prescription thus in order to limit the spread of bloodborne diseases such as hepatitis and hiv through shared injection equipment many countries have needle exchange programs in most larger cities in some countries such programs are wholly or partially subsidized by the government blunted needles manufactured without a sharp bevel and usually nonsterile are used industrially for filling small containers or accurately applying small amounts of solvent or glue it is estimated that about 10 of the adult population  may have a phobia of needles trypanophobia and it is much more common in children ages 516 patients can ask for a patch from the nurse to numb the area of where the injection will take place to reduce pain

V microdispensing is the technique of producing liquid media dosages in volumes of less than one microlitre the continuing miniaturization in almost all technical areas creates constant challenges for industry development and research facilities microdispensing is one of those challenges ever smaller amounts of adhesive liquid oil grease and a multitude of other media must be dispensed reliably and accurately in dosage and placement with shortest cycle times the precise positioning and quantity of fluids such as glue reagents or any other substance has a great influence on the overall quality of the medical device involveda few examples are microdosing systems with a quantity as small as 50 picolitres volumetric systems for use with adhesives and spraying systems for silicone coating needles and other surfaces   there are two basic types of dispensing techniques classic contact dispensing and noncontact dispensing in contact dispensing the drop forms at the exit of a nozzle and is deposited by contact while the drop is still on the nozzle the technique is as old as the wish to divide a medium stored in a big container into smaller amounts a good example for this is applying adhesive with a tube to apply the adhesive requires contact between the tip of the tube and the part for the bead of adhesive to be transferred this method has disadvantages despite all of these disadvantages contact dispensing is still used in the majority of automated processes today because of gear pump pressuretime systems in noncontact dispensing the drop also forms at the end of a nozzle but far enough away from the target area that the drop separates from the nozzle before it hits this too is a very old technique as old as squirting liquid from a tube because of increasing requirements in regards to cycle time and accuracy in almost all areas of production noncontact dispensing is constantly gaining importance a good example for this is the attachment of very small electronic parts smd parts onto printed circuit boards and substrates for this the part carrier only needs to be positioned in one plane  after that the adhesive can be transferred without contact the following examples show the advantages of noncontact dispensing noncontact dispensing can be divided in two different methods jetforming dispensing exists when the flow velocity of a medium at the nozzle exit is high enough that the effects of gravitation and surface tension on the separation of the fluid from the nozzle are of secondary importance this state is characterized by the weber number where the physical border line between drop and jetforming is around a webernumber of 8 at this point the dynamic pressure of the flowing medium exceeds the pressure from the surface tension of the drop which therefore sticks to the nozzle this transitional stage can be demonstrated at a water tap by gradually increasing the flow going from the dropping status until a continuous water jet has formed the webernumber in this case is however clearly above 8 because of the jet exit conditions of the nozzle by using the webernumber the theoretical lower limit of the mass flow can be found for the jetforming conditions in actual applications to assure a safe dispensing process the real webernumbers chosen should be between 20 and 50 for a calculated estimation of the fluid flow velocity in the nozzle for fluids with newtonian flow behavior the formula for capillary fluid flow according to the hagenpoiseuille law has been proven to avoid atomizing of the fluid at the nozzle exit the fluid flow in the nozzle must be laminar which is the case as long as the reynolds number re of the nozzle is smaller than the critical reynoldsnumber of the nozzle reynoldsnumber of the nozzle critical reynoldsnumber of the nozzle thus the theoretical range of the jetforming dispension is enclosed at its lower limit by the webernumber and at its upper limit by the critical reynoldsnumber for practical applications a high kinetic energy in the fluid jet is not desirable because the jet probably would burst and spatter tiny droplets around the target point jetforming dispensing systems are therefore usually operated in the area of lower webernumbers in practice the calculation of the webernumber becomes more complicated when fluids with additives are used which demonstrate a nonnewtonian ie thixotropic flow behavior and therefore the viscosity during the flow through the nozzle is different dynamic drop dispensing is characterised by separation of a drop from the nozzle exit through a dynamic process because the static pressure of the liquid medium is insufficient for forming a fluid jet a wellknown example is inkjet printing in this application the volume of a small dispensing chamber with adjoining nozzle becomes reduced through a short impulse whereby the ink is ejected through the nozzle nozzle chamber nozzle and ink reservoir are hereby fluidically connected without any valve in between during the dispensing process some of the medium is also flowing in the reverse direction back into the reservoir the surface tension of the fluid at the nozzle exit prevents air being sucked in and fluid from exiting the nozzle when the dispensing chamber is filled up again the principle of this process is only useful for lowviscosity fluids and this principle is not applicable with higher fluid pressures inkjet systems have the following inherent properties  very small singledrop volumes are achievable 8 picolitres high dispensing frequencies can be realised some khz low costs for mass production only certain lowviscosity media are dispensable ie no volatile media principally not leakproof for industrial production the dispensing amounts and the range of viscosity spectra of inkjet systems for most applications are too small in these fields of production speciallydesigned valves with tappet drives of high dynamic are used instead these microdispensing systems are characterised by the following properties  single drop volumes from 10 to 200 nanolitres dispensing frequencies up to 100hz dispensing accuracy  1 media viscosities up to 200 pas thixotropic given the specific dispensing knowledge a huge number of media can be dispensed without contact

V a vacuum mattress or vacmat is a medical device used for the immobilisation of patients especially in case of a vertebra pelvis or limb trauma especially for femur trauma it is also used for manual transportation of patients for short distances it replaces the stretcher it was invented by loed and haederl who called it shell mattress matelas coquille in french   it consists of a sealed polymer bag bigger than an adult human body that encloses small polystyrene balls with a valve straps and handles it is washable and invisible to xrays when the mattress is under pressure the balls are free and the mattress can be moulded usually the vacuum mattress is put on a stretcher the patient is put on the mattress eg with a scoop stretcher and the sides of the mattress are moulded around the patient then the air is pumped out through the valve and the valve is closed the atmospheric pressure presses the balls together and the mattress becomes hard and rigid the straps are then tied to secure the patient a sheet is usually put on the vacuum mattress for three reasons the full spine immobilisation splint is performed with the vacuum mattress is put on a stretcher or possibly on a long spine board the straps are put under the mattress along its side so they do not reach the ground then the polystyrene balls are distributed evenly through the mattress by shaking its surface a section with fewer balls would be less rigid it is also possible to concentrate the balls in a given point to make this place more rigid finally a sheet is put on the mattress the sheet is folded so it will be possible to pull it to wrap the casualty into it the profile has an sshape the team member also checks that the pump manual or electrical works in the right direction there are three ways to put the casualty on the vacuum mattress in all cases the vacuum valve is up and at the feet of the casualty once the casualty is on the mattress the sheet is wrapped around himher and the sides of the mattress are folded against their body the top of the head must be kept clear the mattress could retract when pumping out the air and thus compress the spine the air is pumped until the mattress is rigid then the valve is closed and the straps are fastened when only three team members are available and there is no scoop stretcher the following procedure can be used while the lifting methods can induce a flexing of the spine this rolling method can be hazardous for several reasons the risk of a torsion of the spine when rolling the risk when sliding the casualty on the mattress the risk of anteversion of the hips and thus of flexing of the spine due to the weight of the legs when lifting the mattress to slide the board the vacuum mattress is an alternative to the use of a long spine board its advantages are its drawbacks are

V a dry powder inhaler dpi is a device that delivers medication to the lungs in the form of a dry powder dpis are commonly used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma bronchitis emphysema and copd although dpis have also been used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus  dpis are an alternative to the aerosol based inhalers commonly called metereddose inhaler or mdi the dpis may require some procedure to allow a measured dose of powder to be ready for the patient to take the medication is commonly held either in a capsule for manual loading or a proprietary from inside the inhaler once loaded or actuated the operator puts the mouthpiece of the inhaler into their mouth and takes a sharp deep inhalation ensuring that the medication reaches the lower parts of the lungs holding their breath for 510 seconds there are a variety of such devices the dose that can be delivered is typically less than a few tens of milligrams in a single breath since larger powder doses may lead to provocation of cough most dpis rely on the force of patient inhalation to entrain powder from the device and subsequently breakup the powder into particles that are small enough to reach the lungs  for this reason insufficient patient inhalation flow rates may lead to reduced dose delivery and incomplete deaggregation of the powder leading to unsatisfactory device performance thus most dpis have a minimum inspiratory effort that is needed for proper use and it is for this reason that such dpis are normally used only in older children and adults   some powder inhalers use lactose as bulking agent and to aid in powder uptake from the device during inhalation while some have suggested that such lactose may be harmful to lactose intolerant people  the lactose dose delivered by dry powder inhalers is typically less than a few milligrams and such doses do not lead to clinically relevant concerns of adverse effects in lactose intolerant patients  dpi medication must be stored in a dry place in a temperature of not more than 25c and humidity between 4050 in a sealed packaging since exposure of the powder to moisture degrades the ability of the device to disperse its medication as a fine powder upon inhalation some medication also needs photo protection

V a vaporizer or vaporiser is a device used to vaporize the active ingredients of plant material commonly cannabis tobacco or other herbs or blends for the purpose of inhalation however they can be used with pure chemicals when mixed with plant material eg tobaccofree nicotine vaporizers contain various forms of extraction chambers including straight bore venturi or sequential venturi and are made of materials such as metal or glass the extracted vapor may be collected in an inflatable bag or inhaled directly through a hose or pipe with no combustion happening when used properly and cooler temperatures  a significantly better efficiency in extracting the ingredients can be obtained hence the irritating and harmful effects of smoking are heavily reduced      as is secondhand smoke   an electronic cigarette is a batterypowered vaporizer which simulates the feeling of smoking but without burning tobacco  the three main types of ecigarettes are cigalikes egos and mods  their use is commonly called vaping  the user activates the ecigarette by taking a puff or pressing a button   they are often cylindrical but come in many variations  some look like traditional cigarettes  most are reusable but there are also disposable versions called first generation cigalikes  there are also second third and fourth generation devices    instead of cigarette smoke the user inhales an aerosol commonly called vapor  ecigarettes typically have a heating element that atomizes a liquid solution known as eliquid  eliquids usually contain propylene glycol glycerin water nicotine and flavorings  eliquids are also sold without propylene glycol without nicotine or without flavors    the benefits and the health risks of ecigarettes are uncertain    there is tentative evidence that they can help people quit smoking  but they have not been proven better than regulated medication  as of 2014  their usefulness in tobacco harm reduction is unclear  but they have a potential to be part of the strategy to decrease tobacco related death and disease  their safety risk to users is similar to that of smokeless tobacco  regulated us food and drug administration fda nicotine replacement products are safer than ecigarettes  but ecigarettes are probably safer than smoking  vaporizers are also used to inhale marijuana of the studies about vaporizing marijuana few have addressed the quality of the vapor extracted and delivered instead studies usually focus on the mode of usage of the vaporizers there are 483 identifiable chemical constituents known to exist in the cannabis plant  and at least 85 different cannabinoids have been isolated from the plant  the aromatic terpenoids begin to vaporize at 1260c 2588f  but the more bioactive tetrahydrocannabinol thc cannabidiol cbd and cannabinol cbn do not vaporize until near their respective boiling points thc 157c 315f  cbd 160180 c 320356 f  and cbn 185c 365f  vaporizing is more efficient than smoking because approximately 30 of thc in marijuana or hashish cigarettes is destroyed by pyrolysis during smoking  vaporizer with water cooling a conductionstyle vaporizer a passiveconvection vaporization pipe with flame filter a portable radiation vaporiser studies have shown that vaporizing cannabis exposes the user to lower levels of harmful substances than smoking cannabis     these findings are important for it is estimated that 1020 percent of patients with chronic pain multiple sclerosis epilepsy and hivaids have admitted to smoking cannabis for therapeutic purposes  for patients a study found that smoking cannabis sativa reduced daily pain by 34 a statistically significant amount  in a study published in the journal of psychopharmacology in may 2008 it was stated that vaporizers were a suitable method for the administration of thc  a 2007 study by the university of california san francisco published in the journal of the american academy of neurology found that there was virtually no exposure to harmful combustion products using the vaporizing device  a 2006 study performed by researchers at leiden university found that vaporizers were safe and effective cannabinoid delivery systems the study stated that the amount of thc delivered by vaporizers were equivalent to the amount delivered by smoking  because of those studies and other studies vaporizers are medically sound devices for delivering thc  the proposed factors affecting output include   not all those have been scientifically tested research using vaporizers found the delivery efficiency highest at around 226c 439f falling to about half efficiency at 150c 302f to 180c 356f degrees depending on material  the purest preparations produced the highest efficiencies about 56 for pure thc versus 29 for plant material female flower tops with 12 thca content besides thc several other cannabinoids as well as a range of other plant components including terpenoids were detected in the plant material using pure thc in the vaporizer no degradation products delta8thc d8thc cannabinol cbn or unknown compounds were detected by hplc analysis  the longer vapor is stored the more thc is lost as it condenses on the surface of the vaporizer or the balloon this loss may be negligible over a few minutes but may exceed 50 after 90 minutes  the leiden university study found that as much as 3040 of inhaled thc was not absorbed by the lungs but simply exhaled however they did not find large individual differences in the amounts exhaled  vaporizers are sometimes used by chefs as a method of applying controlled heat to herbs and spices to release flavors that are otherwise difficult to titrate or apply or that might be spoiled by overheating during cooking    grant achatz chefproprietor of alinea in chicago uses the aromafilled bags as placemats punctured when plates are placed in front of the customer

V a lotion is a lowviscosity topical preparation intended for application to unbroken skin by contrast creams and gels have higher viscosity   lotions are applied to external skin with bare hands a brush a clean cloth cotton wool or gauze while lotion may be used as a medicine delivery system many lotions especially hand lotions and body lotions are meant instead simply smooth moisturize and soften the skin  these may be used in antiaging lotions which can also be classified as a cosmetic in many cases and may contain fragrances the food and drug administration voiced concern about lotions not classified as drugs that advertise antiaging or antiwrinkle properties     dermatologists can prescribe lotions to treat or prevent skin diseases  it is not unusual for the same drug ingredient to be formulated into a lotion cream and ointment creams are the most convenient of the three but are inappropriate for application to regions of hairy skin such as the scalp while a lotion is less viscous and may be readily applied to these areas many medicated shampoos are in fact lotions historically lotions also had an advantage in that they may be spread thinly compared to a cream or ointment and may economically cover a large area of skin but product research has steadily eroded this distinction noncomedogenic lotions are recommended for use on acne prone skin lotions can be used for the delivery to the skin of medications such as since heath care workers must wash their hands frequently to prevent disease transmission hospital grade lotion is recommended to prevent skin dermatitis caused by frequent exposure to cleaning agents in the soap  a 2006 study found that application of hospital grade lotion after hand washing significantly reduced skin roughness and dryness  care must be taken not to use consumer lotions in a hospital environment as the perfumes and allergens may be a danger to those who are immunodeficient   most lotions are oilinwater emulsions using a substance such as cetearyl alcohol to keep the emulsion together but waterinoil lotions are also formulated the key components of a skin care lotion cream or gel emulsion that is mixtures of oil and water are the aqueous and oily phases an emulgent to prevent separation of these two phases and if used the drug substance or substances a wide variety of other ingredients such as fragrances glycerol petroleum jelly dyes preservatives proteins and stabilizing agents are commonly added to lotions since thickness and consistency are key factors in lotions and creams it is important to understand the manufacturing process that determines viscosity manufacturing lotions and creams can be completed in two cycles 1 emollients and lubricants are dispersed in oil with blending and thickening agents 2 perfume color and preservatives are dispersed in the water cycle active ingredients are broken up in both cycles depending on the raw materials involved and the desired properties of the lotion or cream a typical oilinwater manufacturing process might go like this  step 1 add flakepowder ingredients to the oil being used to prepare the oil phase  step 2 disperse active ingredients  step 3 prepare the water phase containing emulsifiers and stabilizers  step 4 mix the oil and water to form an emulsion note this is aided by heating to between 110185 f 4585 c depending on the formulation and viscosity desired  step 5 continue mixing until the end product is completed careful note should be taken in choosing the right mixing equipment for lotion manufacturing to avoid agglomerates and long processing times it can make all the difference in manufacturing time and costs conventional agitators can present a number of problems including agglomerates and longer processing times on the other hand high shear inline mixers can produce quality lotions and creams without many of the complications encountered with conventional mixers sonolation is also a process that is growing in popularity there is currently no regulation over use of the term hypoallergenic and even pediatric skin products with the label were found to still contain allergens   those with eczema are especially vulnerable to an allergic reaction with lotion as their compromised skin barrier allows preservatives to bind with and activate immune cells  the american academy of allergy asthma and immunology warns that lotion containing ingredients commonly found in food such as goats milk cows milk coconut milk or oil may introduce new allergies and an allergic reaction when those foods are later consumed  a 2015 study funded by the california breast cancer research program found that parabens a common ingredient in cosmetic lotions stimulate breast cancer cell proliferation

V an enema \u02c8\u025bn\u0259m\u0259 plural enemata or enemas or clyster is a fluid injected into the lower bowel by way of the rectum  the most frequent use of an enema is as a cleansing enema also called a soapsuds enema which is given to relieve constipation or for bowel cleansing before a medical examination or procedure  in standard medicine an enema may also be employed as a lower gastrointestinal series also called a barium enema  to check diarrhea as a vehicle for the administration of food water or medicine as a stimulant to the general system as a local application and more rarely as a means of reducing temperature  as treatment for encopresis and as rehydration therapy proctoclysis in patients for whom intravenous therapy is not applicable  enemas are used as part of some alternative health therapies they are also used to administer certain medical or recreational drugs and for other purposes   the main medical usages of enemas are improper administration of an enema may cause electrolyte imbalance with repeated enemas or ruptures to the bowel or rectal tissues resulting in internal bleeding however these occurrences are rare in healthy sober adults internal bleeding or rupture may leave the individual exposed to infections from intestinal bacteria blood resulting from tears in the colon may not always be visible but can be distinguished if the feces are unusually dark or have a red hue if intestinal rupture is suspected medical assistance should be obtained immediately  the enema tube and solution may stimulate the vagus nerve which may trigger an arrhythmia such as bradycardia enemas should not be used if there is an undiagnosed abdominal pain since the peristalsis of the bowel can cause an inflamed appendix to rupture there are arguments both for and against colonic irrigation in people with diverticulitis ulcerative colitis crohns disease severe or internal hemorrhoids or tumors in the rectum or colon and its usage is not recommended soon after bowel surgery unless directed by ones health care provider regular treatments should be avoided by people with heart disease or renal failure colonics are inappropriate for people with bowel rectal or anal pathologies where the pathology contributes to the risk of bowel perforation  recent research has shown that ozone water which is sometimes used in enemas can immediately cause microscopic colitis  a recent case series  of 11 patients with five deaths illustrated the danger of phosphate enemas in highrisk patients many selfgiven enemas used at home are the packaged disposable buffered sodium phosphate solutions in singleuse bottles sold under a variety of brand names or in generic formats these units come with a lubricated nozzle attached to the top of the container some enemas are administered using socalled disposable bags connected to disposable tubing despite the names such units can commonly be used for many months or years without significant deterioration in asian countries particularly in japan commercially available disposable enemas typically contain glycerin at concentrations varying from 3050 or sodium chloride they are not lubricated and the amount of liquid contained in them may vary although most contain about 2040ml of diluted glycerin in medical or hospital environments reusable enema equipment is now rare because of the expense of disinfecting a waterbased solution for a singlepatient stay of short duration an inexpensive disposable enema bag can be used for several days or weeks using a simple rinse out procedure after each enema administration the difficulty comes from the longer time period and expense required of nursing aides to give a gentle waterbased enema to a patient as compared to the very few minutes it takes the same nursing aide to give the more irritating cold packaged sodium phosphate unit for home use disposable enema bottle units are common but reusable rubber or vinyl bags or enema bulbs may also be used in former times enemas were infrequently administered using clyster syringes if such commercially available items are not at hand ordinary water bottles are sometimes used the term colonic irrigation is commonly used in gastroenterology to refer to the practice of introducing water through a colostomy or a surgically constructed conduit as a treatment for constipation  the food and drug administration has ruled that colonic irrigation equipment is not approved for sale for the purpose of general wellbeing  and has taken action against many distributors of this equipment including a warning letter  the use of enemas for reasons other than the relief of constipation is currently regulated in some parts of the united states  while practitioners in other states may go through a voluntary certification process  the same term is also used in alternative medicine where it may involve the use of substances mixed with water in order to detoxify the body practitioners believe the accumulation of fecal matter in the large intestine leads to ill health  this resurrects the old medical concept of autointoxication which was orthodox doctrine up to the end of the 19th century but which has now been discredited    although well documented the procedure of inserting coffee through the anus to cleanse the rectum and large intestines is considered by most medical authorities to be unproven rash and potentially dangerous   coffee enemas can cause numerous side effects including infections sepsis including campylobacter sepsis severe electrolyte imbalance colitis polymicrobial enteric septicemia proctocolitis salmonella brain abscess and heart failure          in the gerson therapy coffee enemas are administered  some proponents of alternative medicine have claimed that coffee enemas have an anticancer effect by detoxifying metabolic products of tumors  but there is no medical scientific evidence to support this    enema comes from greek \u1f14\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1 nema from \u1f10\u03bd\u03af\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 en\u0113mi i inject clyster \u02c8kl\u026ast\u0259r also spelled glister in the 17th century rarely cloister or clister comes from greek \u03ba\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 klyst\u1e17r from \u03ba\u03bb\u03cd\u03b6\u03c9 klzo i wash it is an archaic word for enema more particularly for enemas administered using a clyster syringe that is a syringe with a rectal nozzle and a plunger rather than a bulb clyster syringes were used from the 17th century or before to the 19th century when they were largely replaced by enema bulb syringes bocks and bags the first mention of the enema in medical literature is in the ancient egyptian ebers papyrus c 1550 bce one of the many types of medical specialists was an iri the shepherd of the anus many medications were administered by enemas  there was a keeper of the royal rectum who may have primarily been the pharaohs enema maker the god thoth according to egyptian mythology invented the enema  the olmec from their middle preclassic period 10th through 7th centeries bce through the spanish conquest used tranceinducing substances ceremonially and these were ingested by among other routes via enemas administered using jars the maya in their late classic age 7th through 10th centuries ce used enemas for at least ritual purposes in the xibalban court of the god d whose worship included ritual cult paraphernalia it is hypothesized that these enemas were for ritual purification and the ingestion of intoxicants and hallucinogens the maya illustrated the use of a characteristic enema bulb syringe by female attendants administering clysters ritually   in the 2nd century ce the greek philosopher celsus recommended an enema of pearl barley in milk or rose oil with butter as a nutrient for those suffering from dysentery and unable to eat  and galen mentions enemas in several contexts  in medieval times appear the first illustrations of enema equipment a clyster syringe consisting of a tube attached to a pump action bulb made of a pig bladder and the 15th century simple piston syringe clysters came into use beginning in the 17th century enema apperatus was chiefly designed for selfadministration at home and many were french as enemas enjoyed wide usage in france  when clyster syringes were in use in europe the patient was placed in an appropriate position kneeling with the buttocks raised or lying on the side a servant or apothecary would then insert the nozzle into the anus and depress the plunger resulting in the liquid remedy generally water but also some other preparations being injected into the colon because of the embarrassment a woman might feel when showing her buttocks and possibly her genitals depending on the position to a male apothecary some contraptions were invented that blocked all from the apothecarys view except for the anal area another invention was syringes equipped with a special bent nozzle which enabled selfadministration thereby eliminating the embarrassment clysters were administered for symptoms of constipation and with more questionable effectiveness stomach aches and other illnesses in his earlymodern treatise the diseases of women with child franois mauriceau records that both midwives and manmidwives commonly administered clysters to labouring mothers just prior to their delivery in the 16th century satirists made physicians a favorite target resembling molires caricature whose prescription for anything was clyster bleed purge or purge bleed clyster  in ropers biography of his fatherinlaw sir thomas more he tells of thomas mores eldest daughter falling sick of the sweating sickness she could not be awakened by doctors after praying it came to thomas more there straightway it came into his mind that a clyster would be the one way to help her which when he told the physicians they at once confessed that if there were any hope of health it was the very best help indeed much marveling among themselves that they had not afore remembered it in the 18th century tobacco smoke enemas were used to resuscitate drowned people tobacco resuscitation kits consisting of a pair of bellows and a tube were provided by the royal humane society of london and placed at various points along the thames  clysters were a favourite medical treatment in the bourgeoisie and nobility of the western world up to the 19th century as medical knowledge was fairly limited at the time purgative clysters were used for a wide variety of ailments the foremost of which were stomach aches and constipation molire in several of his plays introduces characters of incompetent physicians and apothecaries fond of prescribing this remedy also discussed by argan the hypochondriac patient of le malade imaginaire more generally clysters were a theme in the burlesque comedies of that time according to claude de rouvroy duc de saintsimon clysters were so popular at the court of king louis xiv of france that the duchess of burgundy had her servant give her a clyster in front of the king her modesty being preserved by an adequate posture before going to the comedy however he also mentions the astonishment of the king and mme de maintenon that she should take it before them in the 19th century many new types of enema administration equipment were devised including the bulb enema later there came to be a device to allow gravity to infuse the solution into the recipient consisting of a rubber bag or bucket connected to a hose with a nozzle at the other end to insert into the patients anus the bag or bucket being held or hung above the patient these continue to be used although rubber has been replaced by modern materials and the bags at least in hospital use as disposable  in the late 20th century the microenema was invented this being a disposable squeeze bottle with contents that cause the body to draw water into the colon eg sodium biphosphate popular in the us or glycerin popular in japan in certain countries such as the united states customary enema usage went well into the 20th century it was thought a good idea to cleanse the bowel in case of fever also pregnant women were given enemas prior to labor supposedly to reduce the risk of feces being passed during contractions under some controversial discussion predelivery enemas were also given to women to speed delivery by inducing contractions this latter usage has since been largely abandoned because obstetricians now commonly give pitocin to induce labor and because women generally found the procedure unpleasant now obsolete the tobacco smoke enema was used for resuscitating victims of drowning during the 18th century nutrient enemas were administered with the intent of providing nutrition when normal eating is not possible although this treatment is ancient dating back at least to galen and commonly used in the middle ages  and still a common technique in 19th century medicine  nutrient enemas have been superseded in modern medical care by tube feeding and intravenous feeding the paraphilia directed towards enemas is known as klismaphilia the enjoyment of enemas enemas may be used as part of bdsm activities or as a regular sexual activity for an individual or between partners enemas can be pleasurable to either sex and in males enemas can stimulate the prostate gland unexpected erections are common in medical settings even if the person would otherwise consider it an unpleasant procedure people who wish to become intoxicated faster have also been known to use an alcohol enema as a method to instill alcohol into the bloodstream absorbed through the membranes of the colon however great care must be taken as to the amount of alcohol used only a small amount is needed as the intestine absorbs the alcohol more quickly than the stomach deaths have resulted due to alcohol poisoning via enema  enemas have also been used for ritual rectal drug administration such as balch alcohol tobacco peyote and other hallucinogenic drugs and entheogens most notably by the maya and also some other american indian tribes some tribes continue the practice in the present day  an enema might be used to clean the colon of feces first to help increase the rate of absorption in rectal administration of dissolved drugs including alcohol  an enema may also be used prior to anal sex or anilingus in order to enhance the sensation of intercourse or to remove feces prior to sex possibly reducing bacterial transmission and risk of infection or just to reduce the possibility of fecal material or detritus from sexual activity adhering to the genitals or sex toys used during the subsequent activity enemas used for anal sex should not be used consistently and enema bottle contents should be removed and replaced with simple lukewarm water continual usage of enema solution may be harmful for the anal cavity enemas have also been forcibly applied as a means of punishment in the vastly influential latin american text facundo or civilization and barbarism for example domingo faustino sarmiento describes the use of pepper and turpentine enemas by police forces as a way of discouraging political dissent in postindependence argentina  the senate intelligence committee report on cia torture documented instances of enemas being used by the central intelligence agency in order to ensure total control over detainees  an 800 pounds 360kg brass statue of a syringe enema bulb held aloft by three angels stands in

V the ionaco often stylized as ionaco or ionaco was an electric belt developed by gaylord wilshire after his career in politics it became popular during the 1920s as a medical curing device   at the age of 64 wilshire turned from his work in real estate to focus on the area of public health he explored radiuminfused garments electric heating pads and distributed a special kind of health bread called excello before working on his electric belt   the name for the health bread likely inspired wilshires name for his belt the ionaco   some historians have offered different theories on wilshires decision to work on the ionaco carolyn thomas de la pea wrote that it could have been to make up for wilshires political failures   donald g davis noted that wilshire had severe headaches which doctors in the united states and europe failed to cure davis argued that wilshire was motivated to enter the medical field to find a cure to his own condition   wilshire first recorded his theory for the radiation cure in 1924 an early idea for this cure was a magnetic turban for head use   wilshire developed the life belt for 15 years until he tried it on himself in 1925 it reportedly worked to cure wilshires condition and he started giving the belt to his relatives and friends who also reported positive results   about 50000 devices were sold between 1925 and 1927   wilshire established the iona company with general offices in los angeles   agencies for this company spread throughout the pacific coast and metropolitan areas of the united states   sales for the ionaco reached a peak in the fall of 1926   and the company attempted to establish agents in europe   by 1927 the company had 23 regional offices and around 70 demonstrators   several health organizations started to investigate the ionaco during this time including the public health league of washington better business bureau of seattle   and rockefeller institute of medical research   on november 18 1926 wilshire published a fullpage advertisement in the los angeles times that challenged the california medical profession to investigate his device   dr arthur j cramp of the american medical association responded with an article that critically analyzed the ionaco eventually leading to the decline of the device in the summer of 1927   the iona company dissolved in 1927 following wilshires death though sellers continued to promote the product throughout the 1930s and 1940s imitators of the product continued to sell electric belts even after this time  wilshires concept for his electric belt and his theory of electromagnetic health was influenced by otto heinrich warburgs work on iron in the blood according to wilshire the devices magnetic field was supposed to increase the bodys absorption of oxygen to free the body from toxic diseases   the belt was marketed as both a healthimproving device and a cure for most diseases including cancer diabetes tuberculosis arthritis neuritis and insomnia   the interior had a thick coil of insulated wire that generated a weak magnetic current it also had a smaller coil of wire with a flashlight globe that would light up when placed close to the thick coil   the exterior of the belt was covered by a thick layer of leather   it was roughly 15 to 18 inches 38 to 46cm in diameter wide enough to fit over the shoulder of a grown adult     it weighed about 65 pounds 29kg   the advertising for the electric belt relied on testimonials published in the newspaper and radio   the ama investigated these claims some of which were attributed to wellknown physicians and found that many of the quotations had been falsified   wilshire and his company marketed the electric device to those most likely to use it including phone subscribers and power plant customers   distributors covered certain regions to promote the device by demonstrations and doortodoor sales inhouse sales associates called demonstrators provided both paid and free treatments for potential buyers   each ionaco belt cost 350 equivalent to 47 in 2016 to manufacture and each belt was sold for 65 equivalent to 869 in 2016   though it could also be purchased on credit for 5 equivalent to 67 in 2016 a month

V patient management software pms is referred to as software that is regulated as a medical device  it is software that is used to acquire medical information from a medical device to be used in the treatment or diagnosis of a patient it can also be software that is an adjunct to a medical device and directly contributes to the treatment of the patient by performing analysis or providing treatment or diagnosis functionality that replaces the decision and judgment of a physician   medical devices are classified and these classifications became somewhat less restrictive in december 2010 regulations provide rules for classifying medical devices into four increasing risk levels  class i class ii class iii and class iv patient management software is classified as either class i or class ii software that is intended to be used to view images or other real time data as an adjunct to the monitoring device itself for the purpose of aiding in treatment or diagnosis of a patient would be class i medical devices medical device software that is an adjunct to another medical device and is involved in data manipulation data analysis data editing image generation determination of measurements identification of a region of interest in an image or identification by an alarm or alert of results from a monitor that are outside of an established range is a class ii medical device if it 1 provides the only means and opportunity to capture or acquire data from a medical device for aiding directly in diagnosis or treatment of a patient or 2 replaces a diagnostic or treatment decision made by a physician  examples of patient management software are pacs remote patient monitoring others include any medical device that is used to transmit data from a medical device or analyze data from a medical device such as blood pressure monitors and glucose monitors many in the health care industry have raised concerns over the quality and software development process of pms the development of pms is often criticized as too focused on simply the software development process and not the product much of these concerns are rooted in safety issues  computerized physician order entry an example of pms highlights some of these safety concerns other criticisms are aimed at the regulations in place some critics argue that regulations stifle innovation and that vendors will no longer have any incentive to create new products also existing and future products will have to adhere to strict licensing procedures and this may affect the sustainability of these products another concern is that the rules are disproportionately strict in comparison to the actual risk associated with a wide variety of ehealth systems  and this may prevent companies from initiating the development of new products regulation of patient management software applies to anyone importing distributing or selling the software health canada is responsible for regulating the sale advertising and distribution of patient management software in canada regulated software is classified based on risk increasing from class i to class ii  the type of license required depends on the classification of the software an establishment license is required from a vendor or manufacturer of class i pms and a medical device license is required from a vendor or manufacturer of class ii pms iso 13485 certification is required of manufacturers of class ii medical devices in august 2009 health canada which is responsible for regulating the advertising manufacturing and sale of medical devices in canada issued a notice confirming that patient management software is a medical device and is subject to the medical devices regulations and the food and drugs act the development of the regulation of patient management software as a medical device began three years earlier when a company called medmanager created a patient portal technology that was deemed a class ii medical device and subject to regulation by health canada developments had taken place thereafter to indicate that medical device classification include patient management software a notice was officially released by health canada in august 2009 indicating that patient management software was indeed a medical device therefore organizations that import sell or otherwise distribute class i patient management software must have an establishment license and class ii patient management software must have a medical device licence in order to obtain a medical device licence manufacturers must hold a quality management system qms certificate issued by an accredited registrar showing that the qms is compliant with iso 13485 2003 medical devices  quality management systems  requirements for regulatory purposes organizations are also required to perform certain postmarket responsibilities such as maintaining distribution and complaint handling records mandatory problem reporting and recalls  in december 2010 a notice was released by health canada further clarifying the definition classification and licensing requirements of software regulated as a medical device for example software used to transmit data from a medical device or software that analyzes data from a medical device and makes diagnostic or treatment decisions normally made by a physician would be considered software regulated as a medical device a product that only stores and displays patient information is not a medical device examples of software that are not medical devices are middleware ehrs including those that are custom built for use only within the organization applications that perform administrative calculations and manipulations such as determining time between appointments or workflow management the wii fit video game personal bmi calculators and pedometer software used for fitness  the regulations apply to software that is distributed with or without compensation

V pillsplitting refers to the practice of splitting a tablet or pill to provide a lower dose of the active ingredient or to obtain multiple smaller doses either to reduce cost or because the pills available provide a larger dose than required many pills that are suitable for splitting aspirin tablets for instance come prescored so that they may easily be halved it is unsafe to split some prescription medications   a pillsplitter is a simple and inexpensive device to split medicinal pills or tablets comprising some means of holding the tablet in place a blade and usually a compartment in which to store the unused part the tablet is positioned and the blade pressed down to split it with care it is often possible to cut a tablet into quarters also available as consumer items are multiple pill splitters which cut numerous round or oblong pills in one operation in the us uniformity of dosage units is defined by the united states pharmacopeia usp which describes itself as the official public standardssetting authority for all prescription and overthecounter medicines dietary supplements and other healthcare products manufactured and sold in the united states  more than 140 countries develop or rely upon us pharmaceutical standards according to the usp the usp standard for dosage uniformity expresses statistical criteria in the complex language of sampling protocols the pharmaceutical dosage literature sometimes boils this down as requiring a standard deviation in dosage weight of less than 6 which roughly corresponds to the weaker ruleofthumb offered for public consumption that the vast majority of dosage units should be within 15 of the dosage target dosage unit is a technical term which covers oral medications tablets pills capsules as well as nonoral delivery methods  a 2002 study of pillsplitting as conducted in four american longterm care facilities determined that 15 of the 22 dispensed prescriptions evaluated 68 had fragment weight variance in excess of usp standards  pillsplitting can be used to save money on pharmaceutical costs as many prescription pharmaceuticals are sold at prices less than proportional to the dose for example a 10mg tablet of a drug might be sold for the same or nearly the same price as a 5mg tablet splitting 10mg tablets allows the patient to purchase half the number of tablets at a lower price than the same weight of 5mg tablets both specialist and generalist physicians are not sufficiently aware of and do not communicate with patients about the cost to them of medication  randall stafford of the stanford school of medicine published a study in 2002 of common prescription medications in the united states in which he evaluates pill splitting for potential cost savings and clinical appropriateness the study identifies eleven prescription medications that satisfied the study criteria based on the american pharmaceutical cost structure pill formulation and dosages of the time  most of the medications listed in the table from the psychiatric drug class are antidepressants not all tablets split equally well in a 2002 study paxil zestril and zoloft split cleanly with 0 rejects glucophage was described as a hard tablet requiring significant force causing tablet halves to fly glyburide exhibited very poor splitting with many splitting into multiple pieces hydrodiuril and oretic crumbled lipitor did not split cleanly and the coating peeled the diamond shaped viagra tablets made location of the midline difficult the worst result reported was oretic 25mg in which 60 of tablets failed to split to within 15 of target weight   some drugs have few different uses and are usually sold in different packages and different doses for different applications the price for some applications may be very different from that for other purposes  one example is minoxidil which is well known as a hairgrowth stimulant the same drug under the name loniten is used for blood pressure control in much larger doses at a much lower price per unit weight  not all pills may safely be split to deliver half the dose effectively it is safe to assume that pills scored to split easily may indeed be split but timerelease formulations and some coated pills should not be split pills split unevenly will not deliver accurate dosage although small variations eg within generic drug active ingredient guidelines will usually not cause significant dosing issues  in a california court filing dated april 2001 trial lawyers for public justice tlpj brought a classaction lawsuit against kaiser permanente on the grounds that kaisers mandatory pillsplitting policy endangers patients health solely to enhance the hmos profits in violation of the california unfair competition law ucl and the california consumer legal remedies act clra     in december 2004 the california court of appeal affirmed the trial court ruling that kaisers policy did not violate ucl or clra noting the suit had failed to present evidence that the policy was unsafe

water or an aqueous solution and the continuous phase is anorganic liquid an oil note 5 a wo emulsion is sometimes called an inverse emulsionthe term inverse emulsion is misleading suggesting incorrectly thatthe emulsion has properties that are the opposite of those of an emulsionits use is therefore not recommended  an emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible unmixable or unblendable emulsions are part of a more general class of twophase systems of matter called colloids although the terms colloid and emulsion are sometimes used interchangeably emulsion should be used when both phases dispersed and continuous are liquids in an emulsion one liquid the dispersed phase is dispersed in the other the continuous phase examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes milk mayonnaise and some cutting fluids for metal working the word emulsion comes from the latin word for to milk as milk is an emulsion of fat and water among other components two liquids can form different types of emulsions as an example oil and water can form first an oilinwater emulsion wherein the oil is the dispersed phase and water is the dispersion medium second they can form a waterinoil emulsion wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the external phase multiple emulsions are also possible including a waterinoilinwater emulsion and an oilinwaterinoil emulsion  emulsions being liquids do not exhibit a static internal structure the droplets dispersed in the liquid matrix called the dispersion medium are usually assumed to be statistically distributed the term emulsion is also used to refer to the photosensitive side of photographic film such a photographic emulsion consist of silver halide colloidal particles dispersed in a gelatin matrix nuclear emulsions are similar to photographic emulsions but used in particle physics to detect highenergy elementary particles   emulsions contain both a dispersed and a continuous phase with the boundary between the phases called the interface emulsions tend to have a cloudy appearance because the many phase interfaces scatter light as it passes through the emulsion emulsions appear white when all light is scattered equally if the emulsion is dilute enough higherfrequency and lowwavelength light will be scattered more and the emulsion will appear bluer this is called the tyndall effect if the emulsion is concentrated enough the color will be distorted toward comparatively longer wavelengths and will appear more yellow this phenomenon is easily observable when comparing skimmed milk which contains little fat to cream which contains a much higher concentration of milk fat one example would be a mixture of water and oil two special classes of emulsions microemulsions and nanoemulsions with droplet sizes below 100nm appear translucent  this property is due to the fact that lightwaves are scattered by the droplets only if their sizes exceed about onequarter of the wavelength of the incident light since the visible spectrum of light is composed of wavelengths between 390 and 750 nanometers nm if the droplet sizes in the emulsion are below about 100nm the light can penetrate through the emulsion without being scattered  due to their similarity in appearance translucent nanoemulsions and microemulsions are frequently confused unlike translucent nanoemulsions which require specialized equipment to be produced microemulsions are spontaneously formed by solubilizing oil molecules with a mixture of surfactants cosurfactants and cosolvents  the required surfactant concentration in a microemulsion is however several times higher than that in a translucent nanoemulsion and significantly exceeds the concentration of the dispersed phase because of many undesirable sideeffects caused by surfactants their presence is disadvantageous or prohibitive in many applications in addition the stability of a microemulsion is often easily compromised by dilution by heating or by changing ph levels common emulsions are inherently unstable and thus do not tend to form spontaneously energy input through shaking stirring homogenizing or exposure to power ultrasound  is needed to form an emulsion over time emulsions tend to revert to the stable state of the phases comprising the emulsion an example of this is seen in the separation of the oil and vinegar components of vinaigrette an unstable emulsion that will quickly separate unless shaken almost continuously there are important exceptions to this rule microemulsions are thermodynamically stable while translucent nanoemulsions are kinetically stable  whether an emulsion of oil and water turns into a waterinoil emulsion or an oilinwater emulsion depends on the volume fraction of both phases and the type of emulsifier surfactant see emulsifier below present in general the bancroft rule applies emulsifiers and emulsifying particles tend to promote dispersion of the phase in which they do not dissolve very well for example proteins dissolve better in water than in oil and so tend to form oilinwater emulsions that is they promote the dispersion of oil droplets throughout a continuous phase of water the geometric structure of an emulsion mixture of two lyophobic liquids with a large concentration of the secondary component is fractal emulsion particles unavoidably form dynamic inhomogeneous structures on small length scale the geometry of these structures is fractal the size of elementary irregularities is governed by a universal function which depends on the volume content of the components the fractal dimension of these irregularities is 25  emulsion stability refers to the ability of an emulsion to resist change in its properties over time  there are four types of instability in emulsions flocculation creaming coalescence and ostwald ripening flocculation occurs when there is an attractive force between the droplets so they form flocs like bunches of grapes coalescence occurs when droplets bump into each other and combine to form a larger droplet so the average droplet size increases over time emulsions can also undergo creaming where the droplets rise to the top of the emulsion under the influence of buoyancy or under the influence of the centripetal force induced when a centrifuge is used an appropriate surface active agent or surfactant can increase the kinetic stability of an emulsion so that the size of the droplets does not change significantly with time it is then said to be stable the stability of emulsions can be characterized using techniques such as light scattering focused beam reflectance measurement centrifugation and rheology each method has advantages and disadvantages the kinetic process of destabilization can be rather long up to several months or even years for some products often the formulator must accelerate this process in order to test products in a reasonable time during product design thermal methods are the most commonly used  these consist of increasing the emulsion temperature to accelerate destabilization if below critical temperatures for phase inversion or chemical degradation temperature affects not only the viscosity but also the interfacial tension in the case of nonionic surfactants or on a broader scope interactions of forces inside the system storing an emulsion at high temperatures enables the simulation of realistic conditions for a product eg a tube of sunscreen emulsion in a car in the summer heat but also to accelerate destabilization processes up to 200 times mechanical methods of acceleration including vibration centrifugation and agitation can also be used these methods are almost always empirical without a sound scientific basis an emulsifier also known as an emulgent is a substance that stabilizes an emulsion by increasing its kinetic stability one class of emulsifiers is known as surface active agents or surfactants examples of food emulsifiers are detergents are another class of surfactants and will physically interact with both oil and water thus stabilizing the interface between the oil and water droplets in suspension this principle is exploited in soap to remove grease for the purpose of cleaning many different emulsifiers are used in pharmacy to prepare emulsions such as creams and lotions common examples include emulsifying wax cetearyl alcohol polysorbate 20 and ceteareth 20  sometimes the inner phase itself can act as an emulsifier and the result is a nanoemulsion where the inner state disperses into nanosize droplets within the outer phase a wellknown example of this phenomenon the ouzo effect happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic anisebased beverage such as ouzo pastis absinthe arak or raki the anisolic compounds which are soluble in ethanol then form nanosize droplets and emulsify within the water the resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white a number of different chemical and physical processes and mechanisms can be involved in the process of emulsification oilinwater emulsions are common in food products waterinoil emulsions are less common in food but still exist in pharmaceutics hairstyling personal hygiene and cosmetics emulsions are frequently used these are usually oil and water emulsions but dispersed and which is continuous depends in many cases on the pharmaceutical formulation these emulsions may be called creams ointments liniments balms pastes films or liquids depending mostly on their oiltowater ratios other additives and their intended route of administration   the first 5 are topical dosage forms and may be used on the surface of the skin transdermally ophthalmically rectally or vaginally a highly liquid emulsion may also be used orally or may be injected in some cases  popular medications occurring in emulsion form include  cod liver oil polysporin cortisol cream canesten and fleet microemulsions are used to deliver vaccines and kill microbes  typical emulsions used in these techniques are nanoemulsions of soybean oil with particles that are 400600nm in diameter  the process is not chemical as with other types of antimicrobial treatments but mechanical the smaller the droplet the greater the surface tension and thus the greater the force required to merge with other lipids the oil is emulsified with detergents using a highshear mixer to stabilize the emulsion so when they encounter the lipids in the cell membrane or envelope of bacteria or viruses they force the lipids to merge with themselves on a mass scale in effect this disintegrates the membrane and kills the pathogen the soybean oil emulsion does not harm normal human cells or the cells of most other higher organisms with the exceptions of sperm cells and blood cells which are vulnerable to nanoemulsions due to the peculiarities of their membrane structures for this reason these nanoemulsions are not currently used intravenously iv the most effective application of this type of nanoemulsion is for the disinfection of surfaces some types of nanoemulsions have been shown to effectively destroy hiv1 and tuberculosis pathogens on nonporous surfaces emulsifying agents are effective at extinguishing fires on small thinlayer spills of flammable liquids class b fires such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuelwater emulsion thereby trapping the flammable vapors in the water phase this emulsion is achieved by applying an aqueous surfactant solution to the fuel through a highpressure nozzle emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulkdeep liquid fuels because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment is a function of the volume of the fuel whereas other agents such as aqueous filmforming foam afff need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation  emulsions are used to manufacture polymer dispersions  polymer production in an emulsion phase has a number of process advantages including prevention of coagulation of product products produced by such polymerisations may be used as the emulsions  products including primary components for glues and paints synthetic latexes rubbers are also produced by this process

V an autoinjector or autoinjector is a medical device designed to deliver a single dose of a particular typically lifesaving drug most autoinjectors are springloaded syringes by design autoinjectors are easy to use and are intended for selfadministration by patients or administration by untrained personnel the site of injection depends on the drug loaded but it typically is administered into the thigh or the buttocks the injectors were initially designed to overcome the hesitation associated with selfadministration of the needlebased drug delivery device   the autoinjector keeps the needle tip shielded prior to injection and also has a passive safety mechanism to prevent accidental firing injection injection depth can be adjustable or fixed and a function for needle shield removal may be incorporated just by pressing a button the syringe needle is automatically inserted and the drug is delivered once the injection is completed some auto injectors have visual indication to confirm that the full dose has been delivered autoinjectors contain glass syringes which can make them fragile and contamination can occur more recently companies have been looking into making autoinjector syringes out of plastic to prevent this issue a newer variant of the autoinjector is the gas jet autoinjector which contains a cylinder of pressurised gas and propels a fine jet of liquid through the skin without the use of a needle this has the advantage that patients who fear needles are more accepting of using these devices the autoinjector can be reloaded and a variety of different doses or different drugs can be used although the only widespread application to date has been for the administration of insulin in the treatment of diabetes

V a medical device is an instrument apparatus implant in vitro reagent or similar or related article that is used to diagnose prevent or treat disease or other conditions and does not achieve its purposes through chemical action within or on the body which would make it a drug  whereas medicinal products also called pharmaceuticals achieve their principal action by pharmacological metabolic or immunological means medical devices act by other means like physical mechanical or thermal means medical devices vary greatly in complexity and application examples range from simple devices such as tongue depressors medical thermometers and disposable gloves to advanced devices such as computers which assist in the conduct of medical testing implants and prostheses the design of medical devices constitutes a major segment of the field of biomedical engineering the global medical device market reached roughly 209 billion in 2006    biomedical device product manufacturing is a long process requiring robust sops and guidelines for production these days with the aid of cad or modelling platforms the work is now much faster and this can act also as a tool for strategic design generation as well as a marketing tool  failure to meet cost targets will lead to substantial losses for an organisation in addition with global competition the rd of new biomedical devices is not just a necessity it is an imperative for biomedical device manufacturing companies the realisation of a new design can be very costly especially with the shorter product life cycle as technology advances there is typically a level of quality safety and reliability that increases exponentially with time  for example initial models of the artificial cardiac pacemaker were external support devices that transmits pulses of electricity to the heart muscles via electrode leads on the chest the electrodes contact the heart directly through the chest allowing stimulation pulses to pass through the body recipients of this typically suffered infection at the entrance of the electrodes which led to the subsequent trial of the first internal pacemaker with electrodes attached to the myocardium by thoracotomy future developments led to the isotopepower source that would last for the lifespan of the patient based on the new approach rules that relate to safety and performance of medical devices were harmonised in the eu in the 1990s the new approach defined in a european council resolution of may 1985  represents an innovative way of technical harmonisation it aims to remove technical barriers to trade and dispel the consequent uncertainty for economic operators to facilitate free movement of goods inside the eu the core legal framework consists of three directives they aim at ensuring a high level of protection of human health and safety and the good functioning of the single market these three main directives have been supplemented over time by several modifying and implementing directives including the last technical revision brought about by directive 200747 ec  directive 200747ec defines a medical device as paraphrasing any instrument apparatus appliance software material or other article whether used alone or in combination together with any accessories including the software intended by its manufacturer to be used specifically for diagnostic andor therapeutic purposes and necessary for its proper application intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of this includes devices that do not achieve their principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological immunological or metabolic meansbut may be assisted in their function by such means  the government of each member state must appoint a competent authority responsible for medical devices the competent authority ca is a body with authority to act on behalf of the member state to ensure that member state government transposes requirements of medical device directives into national law and applies them the ca reports to the minister of health in the member state the ca in one member state has no jurisdiction in any other member state but exchanges information and tries to reach common positions in the uk for example the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra acts as a ca in italy it is the ministero salute ministry of health  medical devices must not be mistaken with medicinal products in the eu all medical devices must be identified with the ce mark in september 2012 the european commission proposed new legislation aimed at enhancing safety traceability and transparency  medical machine contrivance implant in vitro reagent or other similar or related article including a component part or accessory that is in august 2013 the fda released over 20 regulations aiming to improve the security of data in medical devices  in response to the growing risks of limited cybersecurity on september 25 2013 the fda released a draft guidance document for regulation of mobile medical applications to clarify what kind of mobile apps related to health would not be regulated and which would be   the term medical devices as defined in the food and drugs act covers a wide range of health or medical instruments used in the treatment mitigation diagnosis or prevention of a disease or abnormal physical condition health canada reviews medical devices to assess their safety effectiveness and quality before authorizing their sale in canada  the regulatory authorities recognize different classes of medical devices based on their design complexity their use characteristics and their potential for harm if misused each country or region defines these categories in different ways the authorities also recognize that some devices are provided in combination with drugs and regulation of these combination products takes this factor into consideration the medical devices bureau of health canada recognizes four classes of medical devices based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device class i devices present the lowest potential risk and do not require a licence class ii devices require the manufacturers declaration of device safety and effectiveness whereas class iii and iv devices present a greater potential risk and are subject to indepth scrutiny  a guidance document for device classification is published by health canada  canadian classes of medical devices correspond to the european council directive 9342eec mdd devices  examples include surgical instruments class i contact lenses and ultrasound scanners class ii orthopedic implants and hemodialysis machines class iii and cardiac pacemakers class iv  under the food drug and cosmetic act the us food and drug administration recognizes three classes of medical devices based on the level of control necessary to assure safety and effectiveness  the classification procedures are described in the code of federal regulations title 21 part 860 usually known as 21 cfr 860  the usfda allows for two regulatory pathways that allow the marketing of medical devices the first and by far the most common is the socalled 510k process named after the cfr section that describes the process a new medical device that can be demonstrated to be substantially equivalent to a previously legally marketed device can be cleared by the fda for marketing as long as the general and special controls as described below are met the vast majority of new medical devices 99 enter the marketplace via this process the 510k pathway rarely requires clinical trials the second regulatory pathway for new medical devices is the premarket approval process described below which is similar to the pathway for a new drug approval typically clinical trials are required for this premarket approval pathway  class i devices are subject to the least regulatory control class i devices are subject to general controls as are class ii and class iii devices    general controls include provisions that relate to adulteration misbranding device registration and listing premarket notification banned devices notification including repair replacement or refund records and reports restricted devices and good manufacturing practices  class i devices are not intended to help support or sustain life or be substantially important in preventing impairment to human health and may not present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury  most class i devices are exempt from the premarket notification and a few are also exempted from most good manufacturing practices regulation    examples of class i devices include elastic bandages examination gloves and handheld surgical instruments  class ii devices are those for which general controls alone cannot assure safety and effectiveness and existing methods are available that provide such assurances   in addition to complying with general controls class ii devices are also subject to special controls  a few class ii devices are exempt from the premarket notification  special controls may include special labeling requirements mandatory performance standards and postmarket surveillance  devices in class ii are held to a higher level of assurance than class i devices and are designed to perform as indicated without causing injury or harm to patient or user examples of class ii devices include acupuncture needles powered wheelchairs infusion pumps air purifiers and surgical drapes    a class iii device is one for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through the general or special controls sufficient for class i or class ii devices   such a device needs premarket approval a scientific review to ensure the devices safety and effectiveness in addition to the general controls of class i   class iii devices are usually those that support or sustain human life are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury  examples of class iii devices that currently require a premarket notification include implantable pacemaker pulse generators hiv diagnostic tests automated external defibrillators and endosseous implants  the classification of medical devices in the european union is outlined in article ix of the council directive 9342eec there are basically four classes ranging from low risk to high risk the authorization of medical devices is guaranteed by a declaration of conformity this declaration is issued by the manufacturer itself but for products in class is im iia iib or iii it must be verified by a certificate of conformity issued by a notified body a notified body is a public or private organisation that has been accredited to validate the compliance of the device to the european directive medical devices that pertain to class i on condition they do not require sterilization or do not measure a function can be marketed purely by selfcertification the european classification depends on rules that involve the medical devices duration of body contact invasive character use of an energy source effect on the central circulation or nervous system diagnostic impact or incorporation of a medicinal product certified medical devices should have the ce mark on the packaging insert leaflets etc these packagings should also show harmonised pictograms and en standardised logos to indicate essential features such as instructions for use expiry date manufacturer sterile dont reuse etc the classification of medical devices in australia is outlined in section 41bd of the therapeutic goods act 1989 and regulation 32 of the therapeutic goods regulations 2002 under control of the therapeutic goods administration similarly to the eu classification they rank in several categories by order of increasing risk and associated required level of control various rules identify the devices category  medical devices such as pacemakers insulin pumps operating room monitors defibrillators and surgical instruments including deepbrain stimulators can incorporate the ability to transmit vital health information from a patients body to medical professionals  some of these devices can be remotely controlled this has engendered concern about privacy and security issues around human error and technical glitches with this technology while only a few studies have looked at the susceptibility of medical devices to hacking there is a risk  in 2008 computer scientists proved that pacemakers and defibrillators can be hacked wirelessly via radio hardware an antenna and a personal computer  these researchers showed they could shut down a combination heart defibrillator and pacemaker and reprogram it to deliver potentially lethal shocks or run out its battery jay radcliff a security researcher interested in the security of medical devices raised fears about the safety of these devices he shared his concerns at the black hat security conference  radcliff fears that the devices are vulnerable and has found that a lethal attack is possible against those with insulin pumps and glucose monitors some medical device makers downplay the threat from such attacks and argue that the demonstrated attacks have been performed by skilled security researchers and are unlikely to occur in the real world at the same time other makers have asked software security experts to investigate the safety of their devices  as recently as june 2011 security experts showed that by using readily available hardware and a user manual a scientist could both tap into the information on the system of a wireless insulin pump in combination with a glucose monitor with the pin of the device the scientist could wirelessly control the dosage of the insulin  anand raghunathan a researcher in this study explains that medical devices are getting smaller and lighter so that they can be easily worn the downside is that additional security features would put an extra strain on the battery and size and drive up prices dr william maisel offered some thoughts on the motivation to engage in this activity motivation to do this hacking might include acquisition of private information for financial gain or competitive advantage damage to a device manufacturers reputation sabotage intent to inflict financial or personal injury or just satisfaction for the attacker  researchers suggest a few safeguards one would be to use rolling codes another solution is to use a technology called bodycoupled communication that uses the human skin as a wave guide for wireless communication  the iso standards for medical devices are covered by ics 1110020 and 1104001   the quality and risk management regarding the topic for regulatory purposes is convened by iso 13485 and iso 14971 iso 134852003 is applicable to all providers and manufacturers of medical devices components contract services and distributors of medical devices the standard is the basis for regulatory compliance in local markets and most export markets    additionally iso 90012008 sets precedence because it signifies that a company engages in the creation of new products it requires that the development of manufactured products have an approval process and a set of rigorous quality standards and development records before the product is distributed  further standards are iec 606011 for electrical devices mainspowered as well as battery powered and iec 62304 for medical software the us fda also published a series of guidances for industry regarding this topic against 21 cfr 820 subchapter hmedical devices  to meet the demands of these industry regulation standards a growing number of medical device distributors are putting the complaint management process at the forefront of their quality management practices this approach further mitigates risks and increases visibility of quality issues  starting in the late 1980s   the fda increased its involvement in reviewing the development of medical device software the precipitant for change was a radiation therapy device therac25 that overdosed patients because of software coding errors  fda is now focused on regulatory oversight on medical device software development process and systemlevel testing  a 2011 study by dr diana zuckerman and paul brown of the national research center for women and families and dr steven nissen of the cleveland clinic published in the archives of internal medicine showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for serious health problems or death had been previously approved by the fda using the less stringent and cheaper 510k process in a few cases the devices had been deemed so lowrisk that they did not need fda regulation of the 113 devices recalled 35 were for cardiovascular issues  this may lead to a reevaluation of fda procedures and better oversight  in 20142015 a new international agreement the medical device single audit program mdsap was put in place with five participant countries australia brazil canada japan and the united states the aim of this program was to develop a process that allows a single audit or inspection to ensure the medical device regulatory requirements for all five countries are satisfied  medical device packaging is highly regulated often medical devices and products are sterilized in the package  sterility must be maintained throughout distribution to allow immediate use by physicians a series of special packaging tests measure the ability of the package to maintain sterility relevant standards include package testing documents and ensures that packages meet regulations and enduse requirements manufacturing processes must be controlled and validated to ensure consistent performance   medical device cleanliness has come under greater scrutiny since 2000 when sulzer orthopedics recalled several thousand metal hip implants that contained a manufacturing residue  based on this event astm established a new task group f041517 for established test methods guidance documents and other standards to address cleanliness of medical devices this task group has issued two standards for permanent implants to date 1 astm f2459 standard test method for extracting residue from metallic medical components and quantifying via gravimetric analysis  2 astm f2847 standard practice for reporting and assessment of residues on single use implants  in addition the cleanliness of reusable devices has led to a series of standards including the astm f041517 task group is working on several new standards that involve designing implants for cleaning validation of cleanliness and recipes for test soils to establish cleaning efficacy  additionally the fda is establishing new guidelines for reprocessing reusable medical devices such as orthoscopic shavers endoscopes and suction tubes  with the rise of smartphone usage in the medical space in 2013 the fda issued to regulate mobile medical applications and protect users from their unintended use soon followed by european and other regulatory agencies this guidance distinguishes the apps subjected to regulation based on the marketing claims of the apps  incorporation of the guidelines during the development phase of such apps can be considered as developing a medical device the regulations have to adapt and propositions for expedite approval may be required due to the nature of versions of mobile application development   a number of specialist universitybased research institutes have been established such as the medical devices center mdc  at the university of minnesota in the us the strathclyde institute of medical devices simd  at the university of strathclyde in scotland and the medical device research institute mdri  at flinders university in australia

V polymethylsiloxane polyhydrate pmsph is a sorbent designed for binding toxic substances of different nature pathogens and metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract and their excretion pmsph is a homogeneous pastelike mass of white or almost white color odorless   to remove toxic substances from the body methods of sorption detoxification are applied based on binding of toxic substances by sorbentshemoperfusion  removal of toxic substances is carried out through the direct contact with blood   enterosorption  innovative method of intestinal adsorbtion is a method of enteral adsorption based on binding of toxic substances by sorbents this method has a long history about 3000 years ago substances have been found empirically that are able to bind harmful substances in the gastrointestinal tract even in ancient egypt coal was necessary for external and internal use along with coal clay has also been used since ancient times medical properties of coal were noted by healers of the ancient egypt hippocrates of cos and his students in the ancient greece only 25 thousand years after foundation of the first famous medical schools on the island of kos in the mid 1860s the name of hippocrates returned in the history of enterosorption hippocratos yatzidis  a greek physician added important new elements to the development of active enteral detoxification and in particular of enterosorption in 1982 the term enterosorption was offered   to refer to the method of enteral sorption detoxification while the sorbents used in this method are called enterosorbents until the late 1970s coal clay and other natural sorbents had been used side effects caused by the use of coal and other natural clay sorbents have limited their use for a long period thus it stimulated the search for new synthetic enterosorbents as a result pmsph a new silicone gellylike enterosorbent was created pmsph was synthesized in the late 70s to the early 80 s in the institute of physical chemistry named after lv pisarzhevsky in kiev ib slinyakova im samodumova  where since 1960 a theoretical basis for the formation of porous structure of organosilicon adsorbents with adjustable pore structure and chemical nature of a given surface had been developed and studies on synthesis of organosilicon adsorbents  porous polymers polyorganosiloxane had been conducted polymethylsiloxane polyhydrate is a gellylike polymeric organosilicon compound the gel is dispersed in water to a particle size less than 300 microns in suspension microstructure electron microscopical studies have revealed that the gelforming matrix has a globular structure and consists of an ensemble of fused globules the globules bound with siloxane linkages form pores  the pores are spaces between the globules filled with water the pore sizes are restricted sorption isotherms for hexane and methanol show that the adsorbent has a mesoporous structure   presence of methyl groups on the surface provides their hydrophobic properties  pmsph particles tend to form a continuous network in the suspension to reduce interaction of the hydrophobic groups sich3 with water these particles can be viewed as 2d sheets rather than 3d solids aqueous suspensions of polymethylsiloxane polyhydrate are characterized by high viscosity  pmsph is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted unchanged within 12 hours a robust porous structure of the gelforming matrix determines absorptive capacity of the mechanism of molecular adsorption and allows mostly to adsorb toxic substances and metabolites eg bilirubin protein breakdown products  thanks to its gellylike consistency pmsph a absorbs macromolecular toxic substances by a mechanism of precipitation in the gel eg bacterial toxins  b exhibits protective properties  elastic gellylike drug particles form a layer on the mucosal surfaces this layer protects the mucous membranes from exposure to various damaging factors while its protective properties are manifested universally  in the intestine and on the mucosal surface of other organs pmsph absorbs toxic substances from the gastrointestinal tract as well as toxic substances xenobiotics trapped in the gastrointestinal tract from the surrounding environment pmsph also prevents reabsorption of toxins and metabolites spun into the lumen of the blood as well as transferred to the intestine with bile pms ph firmly binds and removes pathogenic bacteria  it should be noted that pmsph possesses a pronounced ability to absorb lipopolysaccharide molecules large lipopolysaccharide molecules coprecipitate in the gel and are excreted  a daily dose of pmsph binds 410mg of lipopolysaccharide lps   which has an extremely high biological activity lps can be found in the outer wall of gramnegative bacteria and is released only when the bacteria are destroyed hence it is also called endotoxin endo means inside inside the bacteria the main reservoir of gramnegative microflora and lipopolysaccharide is the distal intestine medical device category

V transfersome is a trademark registered by the german company idea ag which refers to its proprietary drug delivery technology the name means carrying body and is derived from the latin word transferre meaning to carry across and the greek word soma meaning a body a transfersome carrier is an artificial vesicle designed to exhibit the characteristics of a cell vesicle or a cell engaged in exocytosis and thus suitable for controlled and potentially targeted drug delivery   the term transfersome and the underlying concept were introduced in 1991 by gregor cevc numerous groups have since been working with similar carriers frequently using different names eg elastic vesicle flexible vesicle ethosome etc to describe them in a broader sense a transfersome is a highly adaptable stressresponsive complex aggregate the form preferred by researchers and pharmacologists is an ultradeformable vesicle possessing an aqueous core surrounded by the complex lipid bilayer interdependencies inherent in the local composition and shape of the bilayer makes the vesicle both selfregulating and selfoptimizing this enables the transfersome to cross various transport barriers efficiently and then act as a drug carrier for noninvasive targeted drug delivery and sustained release of therapeutic agents the carrier aggregate is composed of at least one amphiphat such as phosphatidylcholine which in aqueous solvents selfassembles into a lipid bilayer that closes into a simple lipid vesicle by addition of at least one bilayer softening component such as a biocompatible surfactant or an amphiphile drug lipid bilayer flexibility and permeability are greatly increased the resulting transfersome is optimized for flexibility and permeability and can therefore adapt its shape to ambient conditions easily and rapidly by adjusting local concentration of each bilayer component to the local stress experienced at the bilayer since its basic organization is broadly similar to a liposome a transfersome differs from more conventional vesicles primarily by its softer more deformable and better adjustable artificial membrane another beneficial consequence of strong bilayer deformability is the increased affinity of a transfersome to bind and retain water an ultradeformable and highly hydrophilic vesicle always tends to avoid dehydration which may involve a transport process related to but not identical with forward osmosis for example a transfersome vesicle applied on an open biological surface such as nonoccluded skin tends to penetrate its barrier and migrate into the waterrich deeper strata to secure adequate hydration barrier penetration involves reversible bilayer deformation but must not compromise either vesicle integrity or barrier properties for the underlying hydration affinity and gradient to remain unimpaired since it is too large to diffuse through the skin the transfersome must find and exploit a suitable route through the organ use of transfersome vesicles for drug delivery therefore relies on the carriers ability to widen and overcome the hydrophilic pores in the skin or some other eg plant cuticle opening the subsequent gradual release of the active agent from the drug carrier allows the drug molecules to diffuse and finally bind to their targets drug transport to an intracellular action site may also involve fusion of the carriers lipid bilayer with the cell membrane unless the vesicle is taken up actively by the cell in the process called endocytosis the mechanical properties and transportability of a vesicle can be studied by measuring stress or deformationdependent vesicle bilayer elasticity and changes in permeability in a single experiment the objective may be reached by determining the pressure dependent area density of the transfersome suspension flux through a nanoporous filter with pores at least 50 smaller than the average vesicle size for the proper transfersome vesicles the proportionality function derived by the experiment socalled penetrability increases nonlinearly with the flux driving force head pressure often sigmoidally the bulk suspension viscosity governs the highest achievable penetrability a suspension of ideal transfersome vesicles experiencing no friction in the barrier therefore yields a similar maximum penetrability value as the comparably tested vesiclessuspending fluid on the other hand the characteristic pressure needed to achieve a significant transport rate with the vesicles suspension mainly depends on the adaptability of the bilayer being evaluated analysis of experimental penetrability vs driving pressure curves can therefore yield the characteristic bilayer elasticity and permeability values based on a theoretical description of material flow as an activated transport process transfersome technology is best suited for noninvasive delivery of therapeutic molecules across open biological barriers where transfersome vesicles can transport molecules that are too big to diffuse through the barrier examples include systemic delivery of therapeutically meaningful amounts of macromolecules such as insulin or interferon across intact mammalian skin other applications include the transport of small molecule drugs which have certain physicochemical properties which would otherwise prevent them from diffusing across the barrier another attraction of transfersome technology is the carriers ability to target peripheral subcutaneous tissue this ability relies on minimisation of the carrierassociated drug clearance through cutaneous blood vessels plexus the nonfenestrated blood capillary walls in the skin together with the tight junctions between endothelial cells preclude vesicles getting directly into blood thus maximising local drug retention and propensity to reach the peripheral tissue targets the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid ketoprofen in a transfersome formulation gained marketing approval by the swiss regulatory agency swissmedic in 2007 the product is expected to be marketed under the trademark diractin further therapeutic products based on the transfersome technology according to idea ag are in clinical development transfersome vesicles are prepared in a similar manner as liposomes except that no separation of the vesicleassociated and free drug is required examples include sonicating  extrusion low shear rates mixing multilamellar liposomes or high highshear homogenisation unilamellar liposomes of the crude vesicle suspension

V a tablet is a pharmaceutical dosage form tablets may be defined as the solid unit dosage form of medicament or medicaments with or without suitable diluents and prepared either by molding or by compression it comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients usually in powder form pressed or compacted from a powder into a solid dose the excipients can include diluents binders or granulating agents glidants flow aids and lubricants to ensure efficient tabletting disintegrants to promote tablet breakup in the digestive tract sweeteners or flavours to enhance taste and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive a polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow to control the release rate of the active ingredient to make it more resistant to the environment extending its shelf life or to enhance the tablets appearance the compressed tablet is the most popular dosage form in use today about twothirds of all prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms and half of these are compressed tablets a tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site it is usually taken orally but can be administered sublingually buccally rectally or intravaginally the tablet is just one of the many forms that an oral drug can take such as syrups elixirs suspensions and emulsions medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever color their components determined but are now made in many shapes and colors to help distinguish different medicines tablets are often stamped with symbols letters and numbers which enable them to be identified sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimeters to about a centimeter   pills date as far back as 1500 bc according to an interview that a pharmacist historian gave the la times  the first references to pills were found on papyruses in ancient egypt and contained bread dough honey or grease medicinal ingredients such as plant powders or spices were mixed in and formed by hand to make little balls or pills the roman scholar pliny who lived from 2379 ad first gave a name to what we now call pillshe called them pilula pills have always been difficult to swallow and efforts long have been made to make them go down easier in medieval times people coated pills with slippery plant substances people even gilded them in gold and silver in the 1800s sugarcoating and gelatincoating was invented as were gelatin capsules the compressed tablet also was invented in the 1800s by a brit named william brockedon he put powder in a tube and compressed it with a mallet and thus a whole new type of pill was created today pills include tablets capsules and variants thereof like capletsessentially anything with medication that can be digested minus the liquid forms colloquially falls into the pill category a caplet is a smooth coated ovalshaped medicinal tablet in the general shape of a capsule an orally disintegrating tablet or orodispersible tablet odt is a drug dosage form available for a limited range of overthecounter otc and prescription medications in the tabletpressing process it is important that all ingredients be fairly dry powdered or granular somewhat uniform in particle size and freely flowing mixed particle sized powders segregate during manufacturing operations due to different densities which can result in tablets with poor drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient api content uniformity but granulation should prevent this content uniformity ensures that the same api dose is delivered with each tablet some apis may be tableted as pure substances but this is rarely the case most formulations include excipients normally a pharmacologically inactive ingredient excipient termed a binder is added to help hold the tablet together and give it strength a wide variety of binders may be used some common ones including lactose dibasic calcium phosphate sucrose corn maize starch microcrystalline cellulose povidone polyvinylpyrrolidone and modified cellulose for example hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose often an ingredient is also needed to act as a disintegrant to aid tablet dispersion once swallowed releasing the api for absorption some binders such as starch and cellulose are also excellent disintegrants tablets are simple and convenient to use they provide an accurately measured dosage of the active ingredient in a convenient portable package and can be designed to protect unstable medications or disguise unpalatable ingredients colored coatings embossed markings and printing can be used to aid tablet recognition manufacturing processes and techniques can provide tablets special properties for example sustained release or fast dissolving formulations some drugs may be unsuitable for administration by the oral route for example protein drugs such as insulin may be denatured by stomach acids such drugs cannot be made into tablets some drugs may be deactivated by the liver when they are carried there from the gastrointestinal tract by the hepatic portal vein the first pass effect making them unsuitable for oral use drugs which can be taken sublingually are absorbed through the oral mucosa so that they bypass the liver and are less susceptible to the first pass effect the oral bioavailability of some drugs may be low due to poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract such drugs may need to be given in very high doses or by injection for drugs that need to have rapid onset or that have severe side effects the oral route may not be suitable for example salbutamol used to treat problems in the respiratory system can have effects on the heart and circulation if taken orally these effects are greatly reduced by inhaling smaller doses direct to the required site of action a proportion of the population have difficulties swallowing tablets either because they just dont like taking them or because their medical condition makes it difficult for them dysphagia vomiting in such instances it may be better to consider alternative dosage form or administration route  tablets can be made in virtually any shape although requirements of patients and tableting machines mean that most are round oval or capsule shaped more unusual shapes have been manufactured but patients find these harder to swallow and they are more vulnerable to chipping or manufacturing problems tablet diameter and shape are determined by the machine tooling used to produce them  a die plus an upper and a lower punch are required this is called a station of tooling the thickness is determined by the amount of tablet material and the position of the punches in relation to each other during compression once this is done we can measure the corresponding pressure applied during compression the shorter the distance between the punches thickness the greater the pressure applied during compression and sometimes the harder the tablet tablets need to be hard enough that they dont break up in the bottle yet friable enough that they disintegrate in the gastric tract tablets need to be strong enough to resist the stresses of packaging shipping and handling by the pharmacist and patient the mechanical strength of tablets is assessed using a combination of i simple failure and erosion tests and ii more sophisticated engineering tests the simpler tests are often used for quality control purposes whereas the more complex tests are used during the design of the formulation and manufacturing process in the research and development phase standards for tablet properties are published in the various international pharmacopeias uspnf ep jp etc the hardness of tablets is the principle measure of mechanical strength hardness is tested using a tablet hardness tester the units for hardness have evolved since the 1930s but are commonly measured in kilograms per square centimeter models of tester include the monsanto or stokes hardness tester from 1930 the pfizer hardness tester from 1950 the strong cob hardness tester and the heberlain or schleeniger hardness tester lubricants prevent ingredients from clumping together and from sticking to the tablet punches or capsule filling machine lubricants also ensure that tablet formation and ejection can occur with low friction between the solid and die wall as well as between granules which helps in uniform filling of the die common minerals like talc or silica and fats eg vegetable stearin magnesium stearate or stearic acid are the most frequently used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules  in the tablet pressing process the main guideline is to ensure that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is in each tablet hence all the ingredients should be wellmixed if a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet two basic techniques are used to granulate powders for compression into a tablet wet granulation and dry granulation powders that can be mixed well do not require granulation and can be compressed into tablets through direct compression wet granulation is a process of using a liquid binder to lightly agglomerate the powder mixture the amount of liquid has to be properly controlled as overwetting will cause the granules to be too hard and underwetting will cause them to be too soft and friable aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than solventbased systems but may not be suitable for drugs which are degraded by hydrolysis low shear wet granulation processes use very simple mixing equipment and can take a considerable time to achieve a uniformly mixed state high shear wet granulation processes use equipment that mixes the powder and liquid at a very fast rate and thus speeds up the manufacturing process fluid bed granulation is a multiplestep wet granulation process performed in the same vessel to preheat granulate and dry the powders it is used because it allows close control of the granulation process dry granulation processes create granules by light compaction of the powder blend under low pressures the compacts soformed are broken up gently to produce granules agglomerates this process is often used when the product to be granulated is sensitive to moisture and heat dry granulation can be conducted on a tablet press using slugging tooling or on a roll press called a roller compactor dry granulation equipment offers a wide range of pressures to attain proper densification and granule formation dry granulation is simpler than wet granulation therefore the cost is reduced however dry granulation often produces a higher percentage of fine granules which can compromise the quality or create yield problems for the tablet dry granulation requires drugs or excipients with cohesive properties and a dry binder may need to be added to the formulation to facilitate the formation of granules after granulation a final lubrication step is used to ensure that the tableting blend does not stick to the equipment during the tableting process this usually involves low shear blending of the granules with a powdered lubricant such as magnesium stearate or stearic acid whatever process is used to make the tableting blend the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar first the powder is filled into the die from above the mass of powder is determined by the position of the lower punch in the die the crosssectional area of the die and the powder density at this stage adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch after die filling the upper punch is lowered into the die and the powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20 the compression can take place in one or two stages main compression and sometimes precompression or tamping and for commercial production occurs very fast 50050 ms per tablet finally the upper punch is pulled up and out of the die decompression and the tablet is ejected from the die by lifting the lower punch until its upper surface is flush with the top face of the die this process is repeated for each tablet common problems encountered during tablet manufacturing operations include tablet formulations are designed and tested using a laboratory machine called a tablet compaction simulator or powder compaction simulator this is a computer controlled device that can measure the punch positions punch pressures friction forces die wall pressures and sometimes the tablet internal temperature during the compaction event numerous experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be performed to optimise a formulation mathematically corrected punch motions can be programmed to simulate any type and model of production tablet press initial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients are very expensive to produce and using a compaction simulator reduces the amount of powder required for product development tablet presses also called tableting machines range from small inexpensive benchtop models that make one tablet at a time singlestation presses with only around a halfton pressure to large computerized industrial models multistation rotary presses that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure the tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer common manufacturers of tablet presses include stokes fette compacting korsch kikusui manesty bd ptk ima and courtoy tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust the position of the lower and upper punches accurately so that the tablet weight thickness and density can each be controlled this is achieved using a series of cams rollers andor tracks that act on the tablet tooling punches mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling because they are usually used to manufacture many different products there are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry american standard tsm and european standard eu tsm and eu configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged  many tablets today are coated after being pressed although sugarcoating was popular in the past the process has many drawbacks modern tablet coatings  are polymer and polysaccharide based with plasticizers and pigments included tablet coatings must be stable and strong enough to survive the handling of the tablet must not make tablets stick together during the coating process and must follow the fine contours of embossed characters or logos on tablets coatings are necessary for tablets that have an unpleasant taste and a smoother finish makes large tablets easier to swallow tablet coatings are also useful to extend the shelflife of components that are sensitive to moisture or oxidation special coatings for example with pearlescent effects can enhance brand recognition if the active ingredient of a tablet is sensitive to acid or is irritant to the stomach lining an enteric coating can be used which is resistant to stomach acid and dissolves in the less acidic area of the intestines enteric coatings are also used for medicines that can be negatively affected by taking a long time to reach the small intestine where they are absorbed coatings are often chosen to control the rate of dissolution of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract some drugs will be absorbed better at different points in the digestive system if the highest percentage of absorption of a drug takes place in the stomach a coating that dissolves quickly and easily in acid will be selected if the rate of absorption is best in the large intestine or colon then a coating that is acid resistant and dissolves slowly would be used to ensure it reached that point before dispersing there are two types of coating machines used in the pharmaceutical industry coating pans and automatic coaters  coating pans are used mostly for sugar coating of pellets automatic coaters are used for all kinds of coatings they can be equipped with remote control panel dehumidifier dust collectors the explosionproof design is required for alcohol containing coatings it is sometimes necessary to split tablets into halves or quarters tablets are easier to break accurately if scored but there are devices called pillsplitters which cut unscored and scored tablets tablets with special coatings for example enteric coatings or controlledrelease coatings should not be broken before use as this will expose the tablet core to the digestive juices circumventing the intended delayedrelease effect

V iec 60601 is a series of technical standards for the safety and effectiveness of medical electrical equipment published by the international electrotechnical commission first published in 1977 and regularly updated and restructured as of 2011 it consists of a general standard about 10 collateral standards and about 60 particular standards   the general standard iec 606011  medical electrical equipment  part 1 general requirements for basic safety and essential performance  gives general requirements of the series of standards 60601 is a widely accepted benchmark for medical electrical equipment and compliance with iec606011 has become a requirement for the commercialisation of electrical medical equipment in many countries  many companies view compliance with iec 606011 as a requirement for most markets national deviations of this series of standards exist which include country specific requirements   see eg ul or aami for us specifics   the european en and canadian csa versions of the standard are identical to the iec standard in 2005 the third edition of iec 606011 was published it was the result of a comprehensive review of the second edition dating from 1988 some key changes are the outline and the numbering scheme of the clauses and subclauses were changed risk management was made much more relevant and the concept of essential performance was added currently 2012 the applicability of the second and third edition is somewhat overlapping   depending on the products under consideration and the countryarea of application iec 60601111 2010 must now be incorporated into the design and verification of a wide range of home use and point of care medical devices along with other applicable standards in the iec 60601 3rd edition series the mandatory date for implementation of the en european version of the standard is june 1 2012 the us fda requires the use of the standard on june 30 2013 while health canada recently extended the required date from june 2012 to april 2013 the north american agencies will only require these standards for new device submissions while the eu will take the more severe approach of requiring all applicable devices being placed on the market to consider the home healthcare standard  requirements of 606011 may be overridden or bypassed by specific language in the standards for a particular product collateral standards numbered 606011x define the requirements for certain aspects of safety and performance eg electromagnetic compatibility iec 6060112 or protection for diagnostic use of xrays iec 6060113 particular standards numbered 606012x define the requirements for specific products or specific measurements built into products eg mr scanners iec 60601233 or electroencephalograms iec 60601226   collaterals and particulars may have their own revisions which are different from the general standard for example iec 6060119 for environmentally conscious design of medical electrical equipment published july 2007 is a collateral standard to iec 606011 and has been developed drawing on extensive practical experience at philips medical systems and siemens medical solutions the part 9 standard asks manufacturers of medical devices to consider the environmental impacts of their devices throughout the products entire life cycle and to minimize these where possible the standard also requires that the manufacturer provide information to the user on how to use the product in the most environmentally sensitive way the usa canada japan australia and new zealand have not yet set transition dates for their national versions of this latest edition 606011 but the national versions published to date do contain the requirement to also conform with iec 6060119 however the european version en 6060112006 requires compliance with the new iec 6060119 collateral standard by september 2009 according to the recent publication of the us national version of the collateral standard for products intended for home use ansiaami ha60601111 the application of the standard does not apply to the nursing home environment in the united states nursing facilities are considered to be environments providing professional healthcare the american version of this collateral standard also places greater emphasis on a requirement that states that inspection of the usability engineering file reinforce that the usability engineering process is necessary for validation of the instructions for use devices typically mandated to use the new standard include oxygen concentrators bodyworn nerve and muscle stimulators beds sleep apnea monitors and associated battery chargers prescribed for use at home although in vitro diagnostic devices such as blood glucose meters are being used by patients at home the standard does not apply as these devices remain under the jurisdiction of the more lenient iec 61010 series  the 60601 certification process has been criticized for its complexity cost and the business risk it raises this has been more particularly a concern during the transition to the third edition due to the indefinite adoption schedule of the new revision

V a spinal board  also known as a long spine board lsb long back board  longboard  spineboard  or backboard  is a patient handling device used primarily in prehospital trauma care designed to provide rigid support during movement of a patient with suspected spinal or limb injuries  they are most commonly used by ambulance staff such as emergency medical technicians and paramedics as well as by specialist emergency personnel such as lifeguards and ski patrollers   historically backboards were also used in an attempt to improve the posture of young people especially girls    the spinal backboard was originally designed as an device to remove people from a vehicle after a time people were simply kept on the spine board for transport without evidence supporting this need   a spinal board is primarily indicated for judicious use to transport people who may have had a spinal injury usually due to the mechanism of injury and the attending team are not able to rule out a spinal injury  the person should be transferred from the board to a hospital bed as soon as possible  for comfort and safety reasons it is recommended to transfer the patient to a vacuum mattress instead in which case a scoop stretcher or long spine board is just used for the transfer  despite its history of use there is no evidence that backboards significantly immobilize the spine nor do they improve patient outcomes additionally cervical spine immobilization has been shown to increase mortality in patients with penetrating trauma and can cause pain agitation respiratory compromise and can lead to the development of bedsores   common clinical issues found with spinal boards include pressure sore development inadequacy of spinal immobilization pain and discomfort respiratory compromise and effects on the quality of radiological imaging  for this reason some professionals view them as unsuitable for the task preferring alternatives  it is advised that no patient should spend more than 30 minutes on a spine board due to the development of discomfort and pressure sores  backboards were invented to be a highly polished surface to move a person to an ems bed not to be used as spinal securing device backboards are almost always used in conjunction with the following devices spine boards are typically made of wood or plastic although there has been a strong shift away from wood boards due to their higher level of maintenance required to keep them in operable condition and to protect them from cracks and other imperfections that could harbor bacteria backboards are designed to be slightly wider and longer than the average human body to accommodate the immobilization straps and have handles for carrying the patient most backboards are designed to be completely xray translucent so that they do not interfere with the exam while patients are strapped to them they are light enough to be easily carried by one person and are usually buoyant the use of backboards has been phased out from use in certain departments   the vacuum mattress may reduce sacral pressures compared to backboards the conforming nature of the vacuum mattress means that patients can be kept immobilized on it for longer periods of time and the immobilisation offers superior stability and comfort to the patient  the kendrick extrication device is another alternative

V orthoaccel technologies inc is a privately owned medical device company based in houston texas founded in 2007 orthoaccel technologies is most notable for developing acceledent a device which uses micropulses to accelerate tooth movement when used in conjunction with dental braces the product was released in the european and australian markets in 2009  south korea in 2012  and the united states since 2012  orthoaccels revenue increased approximately 300 percent from 2011 to 2012  and the following year orthoaccel began selling acceledent in canada  around 40000 acceledent units had been shipped to american practices as of june 2015    orthoaccel technologies inc was founded in 2007 in houston texas and a prototype for acceledent was developed in 2008  originally the technology was being designed for bone metabolism by orthopedics where lowmagnitude highfrequency vibrations would stimulate bone into remodeling at a faster rate  among the original developers was dr jeremy mao who was then on the faculty at the university of illinois  later redesigned to focus on the jaw acceledent is noninvasive and uses the application of micropulses to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement  early clinical testing began in 2008 in houston  acceledent was marketed in europe in 2009  with the first implementation of the device taking place in october 2009 at a private practice in the united kingdom  in late 2009 the australian therapeutic goods administration approved acceledent for the australian market on a limited basis  in february 2010 orthoaccel received clearance from the korean food and drug administration kfda to officially market acceledent in south korea the company inno dmc was announced as the sole acceledent distributor in the country  in the united states acceledent was enrolled in an fda investigational device exemption ide study in 2009 with the study concluding that the product could reduce treatment time by up to 56 after the study the fda approved acceledent as a class ii medical device in 2011  acceledent was released in the us market in 2012 and acceledent aura the next version of the product was subsequently released in 2013  dr john graham was the first orthodontist to use the device in the united states particularly in arizona and utah  orthoaccels revenue increased approximately 300 percent from 2011 to 2012  in march 2013 the company received clearance from health canada to expand into the canadian market dr paul korne former president of the canadian association of orthodontists had been one of the figures in canada petitioning for the devices approval  a review of the product was published in november 2014 in the journal of clinical orthodontics titled the effect of vibration on the rate of leveling and alignment  by june 2015 around 40000 units had been shipped by orthoaccel to around 2500 american practices  acceledent is the primary product line produced by orthoaccel technologies there have been two models created to date acceledent and acceledent aura acceledent has been in use in both europe  and australia since 2009  and south korea since 2010  it was released in the united states market in 2012  and canada in 2013  there have been a number of studies looking into the devices safety and effectiveness       as a class ii fda cleared medical device acceledent is only made available to patients via prescription from an orthodontist  acceledent is a handsfree orthodontic device  that produces a 30 hertz vibration  accelerating bone remodeling a key component of tooth movement  and the speed with which braces and other orthodontic devices work  the device is used in conjunction with braces either bracket braces or clear aligners  and increases tooth movement  by thirty eight  to fifty percent in orthodontic treatment  according to king5 on average patients wear braces about 18 months without the acceledent device and half the time with it  the patient bites down on the portable acceledent device  for twenty minutes per day  it uses a usb port for charging and computer connection to acceledents fasttrac usage report  there have been a number of studies and clinical trials on the effects of the acceledent device  a study in 2010 published in the magazine orthodontic practice us concluded that the device did indeed increase tooth movement  after having published the same conclusion in november 2009 in a study for aesthetic dentistry today  in august 2011 chung h kau published a second paper on acceledent in head  face medicine kau concluded that use of the device did not impact root length and that for the 14 patients who finished the clinical trial no clinically significant changes between root lengths were noted above 05 mm  a study was also done on the treatment time of patients with more severe reconstructive surgery as compared to conventional orthodontics in part via the conclusions of private practitioners  according to the londonbased dr asif chatoo there was an estimated 25 reduction in treatment time for a patient using lingual braces and requiring surgery to correct a skeletal discrepancy with dr chatoo stating in 2011 that i predicted a treatment time of 24 months this was an average treatmenttime prediction based on my experience in treating similar cases with lingual braces and orthognathic surgery treatment with this patient was successfully completed in 175 months  dr s jay bowman published a study of the device in 2014 in the journal of clinical orthodontics concluding that acceledent did increase the rate of tooth movement and that even if treatment time were not a significant issue for many patients and practitioners the prospect of improving the effectiveness of biomechanics through enhanced tooth movement would be a worthy goal  in 2015 peter t gakunga et al performed trials with acceledent in a paper titled cyclic loading vibration accelerates tooth movement in orthodontic patients a doubleblind randomized controlled trial they again studied the speed of tooth movement when acceledent was used in conjunction with braces the research closely followed a recent paper which had found flaws in the preexisting clinical trials on tooth movement and which had further claimed there was a lack of quality randomized clinical trials that would allow for an evidencebased approach gakunga et al went on to perform a trial similar in nature to previous studies but claimed that they used mechanics that maximized the reproducibility of orthodontic force application and measurement of tooth movement the study would conclude that the application of cyclic loading vibration of 025n 25g at the frequency of 30hz as an adjunct to treatment with a fixed orthodontic appliance significantly increases the rate of orthodontic tooth movement  the study further concluded that competitive brands such as the tooth masseuse had no effect on the rate of tooth movement likely because the tooth masseuse was never intended or designed to accelerate tooth movement its output frequency is four times higher compared to our with acceledent while the force is about four times lower

V controlled release is a term referring to the presentation or delivery of compounds in response to stimuli or time this can be for purposes in several areas including agriculture cosmetics and personal care pharmaceuticals and food science most commonly it refers to time dependent release in oral dose formulations timed release has several distinct variants such as sustained release where prolonged release is intended pulse release delayed release eg to target different regions of the gi tract etc a distinction of controlled release is that not only prolongs action but it attempts to maintain drug levels within the therapeutic window to avoid potentially hazardous peaks in drug concentration following ingestion or injection and to maximize therapeutic efficiency the science of controlled release originates from the development of oral sustainedrelease products in the late 1940s and early 1950s the development of controlled release of marine antifoulants in the 1950s and controlled release fertilizer in the 1970s where sustained and controlled delivery of nutrients following a single application to the soil delivery is usually effected by dissolution degradation or disintegration of an excipient in which the active compound is formulated enteric coating and other encapsulation technologies can further modify release profiles in addition to pills capsules and injectable drug carriers that often have an additional release function forms of controlled release medicines include gels implants and devices eg the vaginal ring and contraceptive implant and transdermal patches examples of stimuli that may be used to bring about release include ph enzymes light magnetic fields temperature ultrasonics osmosis and more recently electronic control of mems  and nems  examples of cosmetics personal care and food science applications often centre on odour or flavour release the release technology scientific and industrial community is represented by the controlled release society crs the crs is the worldwide society for delivery science and technologies crs serves more than 1600 members from more than 50 countries twothirds of crs membership is represented by industry and onethird represents academia and government crs is affiliated with the journal of controlled release and drug delivery and translational research scientific journals

services   in 1893 cf samms and jb wantz founded the victor electric company in a basement by 1896 they made electrostatic generators for exciting xray tubes and electrotherapeutic devices  they had a staff of six and a capital of 3000 invested in the company  victor electric  plunged into the xray business and by 1896 one year after roentgens discovery were making xray machines the business grew rapidly and so in 1896 moved into new premises three times the original size but this did not solve the space problems and the company made 3 moves by 1899  victor electric had competitors in 1896 a gafrye began making xray tubes which in 1897 was purchased by swett  lewis as the first merger in the xray business  during the first years it was easier to keep up with the competition than space requirements by 1903 victor electric had outgrown its facilities at 418 dearborn st in chicago and bought two floors of a building at 55 market street chicago this was again only a temporary stop by 1910 it was too small and the firm moved again in 1911 to a building at the corner of jackson blvd and damen avenue this was the first permanent home of victor electric co they stayed there 35 years and during this time gradually acquired all the space in the building and several around it during the first 20 years of the xray business many new names appeared in 1901 the western electric coil co was formed in 1902 macalaster  wiggin purchased the xray tube business of swett  lewis two other companies were the radio electric co which was later to be known as snookroentgen manufacturing and the scheidel western xray coil co in 1916 the first significant merger took place scheidel western snookroentgen macalaster  wiggin and victor electric co were merged with victor the surviving name victors two founders had key roles in the new firm cfsamms was company president and jbwantz was vicepresident of manufacturing and engineering four years later in 1920 a second major merger was accomplished when victor was acquired by general electric   which was at that time the foremost manufacturer of xray tubes  the marriage of victor electric and general electric became complete of july 28 1926 when victor was declared a wholly owned affiliate of general electric the merger brought renewed vitality to the organization and victor entered the foreign market with equipment sold and serviced in nearly 70 countries in 1930 the name was changed from victor to general electric xray corporation  world war ii saw the dramatic use of xrays in industry for nondestructive testing of war materials it also saw the broad use of xrays as a medical tool for military services as the war ended ge xray corporation continued to grow greater production capacity and greater expertise was needed in the core business of building xray tubes since the tubes were made from handblown glass the decision was made to move the company 90 miles north to milwaukee wisconsin in order to tap into the enormous amount of glassblowing talent in milwaukees beerbrewing industry the company moved from jackson blvd in chicago to a 43acre 170000m  site in the city of west milwaukee which had been used for building turbochargers during the war the street in front was renamed electric avenue and the general electric xray corporation had a new home in 1947 in 1951 the corporate structure was dissolved and the name changed to general electric xray department this new name lasted less than 10 years as the department divested itself of its industrial xray business widened its medical business and took on the name of ge medical systems department one of the reasons for the name of medical systems was due to the increase in the electromedical business which began in 1961 with the introduction of patient monitoring equipment by 1967 modular equipment was developed which was soon popular in cardiac and intensive care units early in 1960 pacemakers were developed in corporate research  development in schenectady new york and in 1969 the standby pacemaker was developed in 1968 the biomedical business section opened its first factory in edgerton avenue late in 1970 a surgical package was introduced and in 1971 equipment to monitor blood gasses during surgery was introduced later in 1971 biomedical opened a 9000 square meter admin and engineering building opposite its factory and in 1972 the section was renamed the cardiosurgical product section with the growth of its medical business the general electric company upgraded the department to the medical systems division in 1971 also in 1971 a major expansion programme was started and the waukesha factory was planned work started in july 1972 and was completed in 1973 in 1973 work on ct was started and eventually the first ct machine was installed in 1976 development continued to the first ct 8800 and after long negotiations ge acquired the medical division of emi group ltd in late 1980 soon after the 1979 takeover of emi medicial division by thorn electric company  the americal antitrust authorities stopped the takeover in the usa however and the emi factory in chicago was bought up by omnimedical who continued to make cts for a number of years meanwhile back at ge the patient monitoring department was sold off in 1981 the initial boost provided by the emi takeover turned into the doldrums as reaganomics sent the us dollar soaring so in 1984 ge bought a 49 share of yms yokogawa medical systems a japanese company yms proceeded to produce highquality lowcost diagnostic equipment for the world market with astounding energy producing new ct models with a speed that was and still remains hard to match in 1983 ge medical started investing heavily in magnetic resonance imaging mri technology investing nearly 1 billion us dollars in a new plant in waukesha and the mr signa was born which would go on to become the very successful mr model range the magnet plant in florence usa was opened a short time later giving ge its own magnet production in the same year ge divested its dental xray division to form gendex dental systems in 1985 ge acquired technicare from johnson and johnson originally named ohio nuclear and in 1979 after another fusion ohio nuclear unirad the name was changed to technicare in 1982 technicare with headquarters in cleveland ohio had been producing a range of rotatestationary cts with an installed base in the thousands as well as some xray diagnostic equipment and a nascent mri product range up to this time the medical systems division had simply been divided into domestic and international but in 1987 it was decided to reorganize into the three poles of america europe and pacific in 1988 ge medical europe merged with cgr a medical equipment supplier based in france to form general electric cgr medical systems the european headquarters were moved from hammersmith uk to buc near paris in 1992 ge had a setback after long negotiations to buy picker international who were a major producer of ct and mr equipment the deal was not approved by the american authorities and so ge just bought the picker service organization in the uk leaving the rest of picker intact in 1994 it was decided to change the name in europe from gecgr back to general electric medical systems at the close of 1998 ge medical acquired the nuclear and mr businesses of elscint then a division of elron based in haifa israel the ct business being bought by picker and in the same year marquette medical systems became a wholly owned subsidiary of ge medical  in 1998 ge medical bought diasonics vingmed ltd from elbit medical imaging of haifa israel thus expanding its ultrasound imaging business  in 2001 ge medical systems acquired san francisco ca based ct maker imatron inc for 210 million imatron produced an electron beam tomography ebt scanner that performs imaging applications used by physicians specializing in cardiology pulmonology and gastroenterology the formal imatron business was later incorporated into ge healthcares diagnostic imaging business segment in early 2002 ge healthcare had acquired medicalogic creator of the former logician an ambulatory electronic medical records system for approximately 32 million  by jan 2003 ge acquired millbrook corporation maker of millbrook practice manager a billing and scheduling system for doctors offices  ge healthcare it would later merge the two products into a single pmemr solution although the standalone emr product is still available and in development also in april 2002 ge healthcare completed the acquisition of visualization technology inc boston ma a manufacturer of intraoperative medical devices and related products for use in minimally invasive image guided surgery  in 2003 ge healthcare acquired instrumentarium including its datexohmeda division a producer manufacturer and supplier of anesthesia machines and mechanical ventilators to satisfy regulatory concerns in the united states and in europe ge healthcare was forced to divest the spacelabs medical division of instrumentarium currently ge healthcare owns 80 of all anesthesia machines in the united states and 60 of the machines in the world the former instrumentarium business was incorporated into ge healthcares clinical systems business segment  in 2004 the former amersham plc business segments were separated into the ge healthcare medical diagnostics and life sciences business segments and 1 may 2013 both the business were combined again under the ge life sciences brand with kieran murphy taking the leadership role also in 2004 ge healthcare along with other healthcare companies built a research reactor for neutron and unit cell research at ges european research center near garching outside of munich germany it is the only such reactor currently in operation in 2005 sir william castell ceo of ge healthcare and former ceo of amersham plc stepped down as ceo to become chairman of the wellcome trusta charity that fosters and promotes human and animal researchin the united kingdom former ge medical systems ceo joe hogan became the overall ceo for the ge healthcare business in 2005 dental imaging operations were separated from ge healthcare the palodex group oy was founded and continues the business with its subsidiaries instrumentarium dental and soredex specifically instrumentarium dental continues the brands orthopantomograph and intraoral systems focus and sigma formerly known as instrumentarium imaging or ge healthcare products    in september 2005 ge healthcare and idx systems corporation announced that they entered into a definitive 12 billion merger agreement for ge to acquire idx a leading healthcare information technology it provider the acquisition was completed in january 2006 idx was folded into ge healthcare integrated it solutions which specializes in clinical information systems and healthcare revenue management on 4 february 2008 ge healthcare announced that it has completed the acquisition of whatman plc lsewhm a global supplier of filtration products and technologies at 270p per share in cash for each whatman share valuing whatman at approximately 363 million approximately 713 million in july 2008 joseph hogan announced his intent to leave his post as ceo of ge healthcare to take the role of ceo at abb  on july 17 2008 ge healthcare announced john dineen had been chosen to replace outgoing ceo joseph hogan mr dineen had been head of ges transportation division since 2005  on march 24 2010 ge healthcare announced acquisition of medplexus   in late

V pteassa was a brand of fluoridefree herbal toothpaste produced in bangui central african republic from 1923 until the factorys closure in 1966 the toothpaste was notable for being one of the first locally manufactured toothpastes in what was the french colony of ubangishari and the formula was loosely based off dentifrice brands in europe whilst using a mixture of salt and local herbs    pteassa was conceived as an idea during a health drive to improve dental services in bangui and rural areas in ubangishari during the early 1920s governor auguste lamblin procured funds to stimulate the local economy and provided bank loans to both natives and residing frenchman  a cooperative was formed at the hopital de iamitie in central bangui between local nurses and french red cross volunteers and it was decided that the governors bank loans should be used to start a toothpaste factory once a formula for a toothpaste was conceived it was decided that local plants such as the utricularia striatula could be used for their antiseptic properties and crushed seeds were added to the ingredients  pteassa started production in february 1923 as a salted orthodontic paste aimed at the lower end of the market incoming governor pierre frangois continued to endorse and subsidise the factory and even invested his own money into furthering the economic scope of pteassa in 1925 small scale factories were set up in berbrati and kagabandoro employing 15 people at each franchise and pteassa soon became the best selling toothpaste in ubangishari  the toothpaste enterprise reached its peak during the early 1950s just before western competitors such as colgate and pepsodent entered the market prior to independence technological developments in oral hygiene had rendered pteassa as a brand using an outdated formula the use of salt and herbs in toothpastes were considered to be substandard in preventing tooth decay and plaque and when independence was proclaimed in 1960 government subsidies ceased to exist a year later and the company faced negative growth  attempts were made to change the formula of the toothpaste to compete with american and european brands the use of salt and herbs were dropped in favour of modern ingredients such as triclosan but this placed a financial strain on the smaller franchises leading to the berbrati factory closing in 1963 with the kagabandoro branch following suit in 1964  the sole remaining toothpaste plant in bangui suffered a small scale fire in 1965 damaging much of the equipment needed to manufacture the product the lack of assistance from the david dacko regime to insure the business had sealed the fate of the pteassa toothpaste plant and the remaining stock of the product was sold throughout 1965 and 1966 until the business folded in december of that year  pteassa was notable in ubangishari and the central african republic for being one of the few local brands to be advertised on radio centrafrique the national radio station moreover large billboards were set up in downtown bangui to advertise the toothpaste given the fact that the business received government subsidies slogans were marketed such as avec le sel et les herbes nous avons dents blanches with salt and herbs we have white teeth and this was widely recognised through ubangishari after the removal of salt and herbs following the 1962 formula change after independence the last advertising slogan was pteassa est le dentifrice moderne pour les citoyens centrafricaine pteassa is the modern toothpaste for central african citizens   1921 dental health drive in ubangishari commences  1923 cooperative forms at the hopital de iamitie in bangui  1923 colonial government invests in formation of the pteassa toothpaste factory  1925 branches set up in berbrati and kagabandoro  1955 colgate and pepsodent enter the market in ubangishari  1960 ubangishari gains independence becomes the central african republic  1961 government removes subsidies for pteassa  1962 formula changed in favour of western medicine  1963 berbrati factory closes  1964 kagabandoro factory closes  1965 fire at bangui factory leading to damaged equipment  1966 business folds as remaining stock is sold

V a metereddose inhaler mdi is a device that delivers a specific amount of medication to the lungs in the form of a short burst of aerosolized medicine that is usually selfadministered by the patient via inhalation it is the most commonly used delivery system for treating asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and other respiratory diseases the medication in a metered dose inhaler is most commonly a bronchodilator corticosteroid or a combination of both for the treatment of asthma and copd other medications less commonly used but also administered by mdi are mast cell stabilizers such as cromoglicate or nedocromil   a metereddose inhaler consists of three major components the canister which is produced in aluminium or stainless steel by means of deep drawing where the formulation resides the metering valve which allows a metered quantity of the formulation to be dispensed with each actuation and an actuator or mouthpiece which allows the patient to operate the device and directs the aerosol into the patients lungs    the formulation itself is made up of the drug a liquefied gas propellant and in many cases stabilising excipients the actuator contains the mating discharge nozzle and generally includes a dust cap to prevent contamination to use the inhaler the patient presses down on the top of the canister with their thumb supporting the lower portion of the actuator actuation of the device releases a single metered dose of the formulation which contains the medication either dissolved or suspended in the propellant breakup of the volatile propellant into droplets followed by rapid evaporation of these droplets results in the generation of an aerosol consisting of micrometersized medication particles that are then inhaled  metereddose inhalers are only one type of inhaler but they are the most commonly used type the replacement of chlorofluorocarbons propellants with hydrofluoroalkanes hfa resulted in the redesign of metereddose inhalers in the 1990s for one variety of beclomethasone inhaler this redesign resulted in considerably smaller aerosol particles being produced and led to an increase of potency by a factor of 26  before the invention of the mdi asthma medication was delivered using a squeeze bulb nebulizer which was fragile and unreliable  the relatively crude nature of these devices also meant that the particles that they generated were relatively large too large for effective drug delivery to the lungs  nonetheless these nebulisers paved the way for inhalation drug delivery providing the inspiration for the mdi mdis were first developed in 1955 by riker laboratories now a subsidiary of 3m healthcare  at that time mdis represented a convergence of two relatively new technologies the cfc propellant and the meshburg metering valve which was originally designed for dispensing perfume  the initial design by riker used a glass canister coated with a vinyl plastic to improve its resilience  by 1956 riker had developed two mdi based products the medihalerept containing epinephrine and the medihaleriso containing isoprenaline  both products are agonists which provide short term relief from asthma symptoms and have now largely been replaced in asthma treatment by salbutamol which is more selective metereddose inhalers are sometimes used with addon devices referred to as holding chambers or spacers which are tubes attached to the inhaler that act as a reservoir or holding chamber and reduce the speed at which the aerosol enters the mouth they serve to hold the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler this makes it easier to use the inhaler and helps ensure that more of the medication gets into the lungs instead of just into the mouth or the air with proper use a spacer can make an inhaler somewhat more effective in delivering medicine  spacers can be especially helpful to adults and children who find a regular metered dose inhaler hard to use people who use corticosteroid inhalers should use a spacer to prevent getting the medicine in their mouth where oral yeast infections and dysphonia can occur  the deposition of the content of drug formulation on the canister surface can result in a shorter shelf life of an mdi inhaler applying a suitable surface coating to the components helps to extend this shelf life over the years a range of coating processes have been developed that can be applied to both the canister and valve to protect the contents from deposition and degradation gas plasma processing is an industrial technique that is carried out in a vacuum to coat the entire mdi inhaler and involves constant or pulsed excitation of gas by either radio frequency rf or microwave field to produce an energetic plasma this coating ensures that the drug formulation does not stick to the interior wall of the md inhaler and results in the patient receiving the prescribed dose of medication whilst also extending the products shelflife a metered dose inhaler contains enough medication for a certain number of actuations or puffs which is printed on the canister even though the inhaler may continue to work beyond that number of uses the amount of medication delivered may not be correct it is important to keep track of the number of times an inhaler was used so that it can be replaced after its recommended number of uses for this reason several regulatory authorities have requested that manufacturers add a dose counter or dose indicator to the actuator several inhalation products are now sold with a dose counteractuator depending on the manufacturer and the product inhalers are sold as a complete unit or the individual canister as a refill prescription one of the most crucial components of a mdi is its propellant the propellant provides the force to generate the aerosol cloud and is also the medium in which the active component must be suspended or dissolved propellants in mdis typically make up more than 99 of the delivered dose  so it is the properties of the propellant that dominate more than any other individual factor this is often overlooked in literature and in industry because so few propellants are used and their contribution is often taken for granted suitable propellants must pass a stringent set of criteria they must in the early days of mdis the most commonly used propellants were the chlorofluorocarbons cfc11 cfc12 and cfc114 in 2008 the food and drug administration announced that inhalers using chlorofluorocarbons as a propellant such as primatene mist could no longer be manufactured or sold as of 2012  this followed from the us decision to agree to the 1987 montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer  phospholipids are important natural surfactant lipids   used in enhancing penetration and bioavailability  phospholipids act by reducing the high surface tension forces at the airwater interface within the alveoli thereby reducing the pressure needed to expand the lungs thus commercially available formulations of phospholipids have been designed to spread rapidly over an airaqueous interface thereby reducing what is otherwise a very high surface tension of water for ease of identification many mdis are colourcoded

V prosthetic neuronal memory silicon chip is a device that imitates the brains process of creating longterm memories this device was designed by theodore berger a biomedical engineer and neurologist at university of southern california berger started to work on this chip in the early 1990s he and his colleagues have been able to implant electrodes into rats and monkeys that restore their memories after previously being impaired while researchers are well into developing an actual memory prosthesis in animals they still need to show that their chips can form longterm memories in many different behavioral situations berger hopes to eventually use these chips as electronic implants for humans whose brains that suffer from diseases such as alzheimers that disrupt neuronal networks   while bergers aspirations of memory implant sounded unrealistic to his colleagues for a long time berger has continued to maintain a high level of determination and has referred to many other successes in neuroprosthetics that once seemed unattainable one of these is the use of cochlear implants which currently help more than 200000 deaf people hear by converting sound into electrical signals that are then sent to the auditory nerve for processing in addition past experiments have indicated that implanted electrodes can allow paralyzed people to control robotic arms using their thoughts researches have also had some success with artificial retinas for blind people berger has spent 35 years of his life trying to develop a keen understanding of how neurons behave in the hippocampusthe hippocampus is a major component of the brain that belongs in the limbic system and consolidates information from shortterm memory to longterm memory and spatial navigation through his research he has been able to develop mathematical theorems that show how electrical signals move through the neurons of the hippocampus to form a longterm memory berger has been contemplating the possibilities of copying some of the brains functions modeling the brain and putting it into a device and getting devices to work in any brain to begin making a brain prosthesis berger and his collaborator valsilis marmarelis a biomedical engineer at usc worked with the hippocampus slices of rats since they knew that neuronal signals travel from one side of the hippocampus to the other the researchers sent random pulses into the hippocampus recorded the signals at specific locales to see how they were changed and then derived equations representing the changes they then programmed those equations into the computer chips next they had to determine whether a chip could be used as a prosthesis or implant for a damaged region in the hippocampus to do this they had to figure out whether they could avoid a central component of the pathway in the brain slices they put electrodes in the region which carried electrical pulses to an external chip the chip then executed the transformations that are normally carried out in the hippocampus and other electrodes sent the signals back to the slice of brain while berger and his research partners are yet to conduct tests on humans their experiments indicate that a silicon chip that is connected to rat and monkey brains via electrodes can analyze information just like actual neurons this means that it would allow living things with damaged neurons to generate memories in one demonstration berger impaired the rats ability to form longterm memories by using pharmacological agents these disrupted the neural circuitry that transfers messages between two subregions of the hippocampus these subregions ca1 and ca3 interact to create longterm memories the rats were unable to remember which lever they needed to pull to obtain the reward the researchers then developed an artificial hippocampus that could duplicate the pattern of interaction between ca3ca1 interactions by analyzing the neural spikes in the cells with an electrode array and then playing back the same pattern on the same array after implanting the artificial hippocampi into the rats their ability to identify the correct lever to pull improved dramatically this artificial hippocampus played a significant role in the developmental stage of the chip as it went on to show that if a prosthetic device and its associated electrodes were implanted in the animals with a normally functioning hippocampus the device could potentially enhance the memory capability of normal rats  last year  scientists conducted an experiment on monkeys where they placed electrodes in the monkeys brains to obtain the code formed in the prefrontal cortex that they believe allowed animals to remember an image that had been shown to them earlier they then drugged the monkeys with cocaine which impairs that part of the brain the researchers were able to improve the monkeys performance by using the implanted electrodes to send the correct code to the monkeys prefrontal cortex berger and his colleagues are working to possibly make this chip applicable to humans in the future for people whose brains suffer damage from alzheimers stroke or injury the disruption of neural networks often stops longterm memories from forming this chip that berger has designed allows the signal processing to take place that would occur naturally in undamaged neurons ultimately berger hopes to restore the ability to create longterm memories by implanting chips such as these into the brain

V a pickering emulsion is an emulsion that is stabilized by solid particles for example colloidal silica which adsorb onto the interface between the two phases this type of emulsion was named after su pickering who described the phenomenon in 1907 although the effect was first recognized by walter ramsden in 1903   if oil and water are mixed and small oil droplets are formed and dispersed throughout the water eventually the droplets will coalesce to decrease the amount of energy in the system however if solid particles are added to the mixture they will bind to the surface of the interface and prevent the droplets from coalescing thus causing the emulsion to be more stable properties such as hydrophobicity shape and size of the particle can have an effect on the stability of the emulsion the particles contact angle to the surface of the droplet is a characteristic of the hydrophobicity if the contact angle of the particle to the interface is low the particle will be mostly wetted by the droplet and therefore will not be likely to prevent coalescence of the droplets particles that are partially hydrophobic ie contact angle of approximately 90 are better stabilizers because they are partially wettable by both liquids and therefore bind better to the surface of the droplets the stabilization energy is given by where r is the particle radius  is the interfacial tension and  is the contact angle when the contact angle is approximately 90 the energy required to stabilize the system is at its minimum  generally the phase that preferentially wets the particle will be the continuous phase in the emulsion system additionally it has been demonstrated that the stability of the pickering emulsions can be improved by the use of amphiphilic janus particles due to the higher adsorption energy of the particles at the liquidliquid interface  this is evident when observing emulsion stabilization using polyelectrolytes homogenised milk is an example of a pickeringstabilized emulsion casein protein units are adsorbed at the surface of milk fat globules and act as a surfactant the casein replaces the milkfat globule membrane which is damaged during homogenisation recently using latex particles for pickering stabilization and then fusing these particles to form a permeable shell a new form of capsule called a colloidosome has been developed according to the definition of dinsmore a colloidosome is a selectively permeable capsule that is composed of colloidal particles  moreover pickering emulsion droplets are suitable templates for microencapsulation and the formation of closednonpermeable capsules as well  recently it was shown that dispersions consisting of phaseseparated aqueous polymer solutions can be stabilised using pickering stabilisation

V a vesosome is a multicompartmental structure of lipidic nature used to deliver drugs they can be considered multivesicular vesicules mvv       and are therefore liposome derived structures   it consists of one or more bilayers enclosing an aqueous core that contains unilamellar vesicles that function as internal compartments which contain the drug and which can vary in composition from each other the external bilayer defines the lumen limits emission of the vesicle contents and protects the vesicle contents from degradation due to lipolytic enzymes its unique properties enable localized drug delivery in specific parts of the body and extend the duration of drug effect also a vesosome is easy to produce and offers the flexibility to deliver multiple drugs within a single carrier which has been shown to offer important advantages in chemotherapy internal vesicle diameters range from 20500nm and vesosome diameters range from about 01 micron to more than 10 micron  we dont have to look very far back in history to find the origins of liposomal drug distribution devices it wasnt long after liposomes were first described by british haematologist dr alec d bangham in 1961 published 1964 at the babraham institute in cambridge that scientists first started to contemplate the possibility of employing them as transportation systems in the blood stream since then there have been many advances in this area and as of 2008 there were 11 clinically approved liposomal drugs that target a variety of pathological conditions and illnesses like fungal infections hepatitis a influenza or cancer now scientists plan to take full advantage of the 40 years of progress in liposome development to enhance this transportation system by employing vesosomes vesosome multicompartment structure encapsulates unilamellar liposomes within a second bilayer for this purpose its necessary to form bilayers that can be opened and closed at will without disrupting the inner content this is achieved by adding ethanol to a variety of saturated phospholipids in its gel phase which drives interdigitation of phospholipids bilayers and subsequent fusion of small vesicles to form flat bilayer sheets these are steady to removal of the residual ethanol until heated above the lipid chain melting temperature tm the bilayers become flexible and the sheets spontaneously close on themselves to form unilamellar vesicles during the closure the sheets can entrap whatever is around in suspension by adding the vesicles aggregates including drugloaded vesicles to the pelleted sheets before heating the mixture encapsulation is carried out to form vesosomes vesosome structure has taken advantage of the progress in liposome development as steric stabilization ph loading of drugs it is loaded by ph gradient and intrinsic biocompatibility it can be modified with a variety of agents for example to specifically target a disease site or promote adhesion or fusion an important variety of molecular structures can be encapsulated in vesosomal vesicles such as proteins with complex threedimensional structures or condensed dna but the most common use is to fill the vesosomes vesicles with certain drugs that are going to be delivered in a particular area due to the small size of the vesosome and its good protection of the inner vesicles it can be used in various cases doing different functions vesosomes are able to locate inflamed areas because of its receptors that are included in the outer lipid bilayer during its construction once in the inflamed area the vesosome will deliver an antiinflammatory substance from its vesicles though a ph gradient they are able to locate tumours too they can even be used to create in a positioned area a different nanoenvironment considering that vesosome size is about 50  200 nanometres either by altering the ph or the concentration of a particular substance to sum up the use of a vesosome means an easy and simple way for many substances to be encapsulated in lipid bilayer vesicles in order to be transported and delivered safely

V in chemistry a suspension is a heterogeneous mixture containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation usually they must be larger than one micrometer  the internal phase solid is dispersed throughout the external phase fluid through mechanical agitation with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents unlike colloids suspensions will eventually settle an example of a suspension would be sand in water the suspended particles are visible under a microscope and will settle over time if left undisturbed this distinguishes a suspension from a colloid in which the suspended particles are smaller and do not settle  colloids and suspensions are different from solutions in which the dissolved substance solute does not exist as a solid and solvent and solute are homogeneously mixed a suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called an aerosol or particulate in the atmosphere these consist of fine dust and soot particles sea salt biogenic and volcanogenic sulfates nitrates and cloud droplets suspensions are classified on the basis of the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium where the former is essentially solid while the latter may either be a solid a liquid or a gas in modern chemical process industries high shear mixing technology has been used to create many novel suspensions suspensions are unstable from the thermodynamic point of view however they can be kinetically stable over a large period of time which determines their shelf life this time span needs to be measured to ensure the best product quality to the final consumer dispersion stability refers to the ability of a dispersion to resist change in its properties over time dj mcclements  dispersion of solid particles in a liquid note definition based on that in ref      multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning is the most widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product hence identifying and quantifying destabilization phenomena     it works on concentrated dispersions without dilution when light is sent through the sample it is back scattered by the particles the backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase therefore local changes in concentration sedimentation and global changes in size flocculation aggregation are detected and monitored the kinetic process of destabilisation can be rather long up to several months or even years for some products and it is often required for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation temperature affects not only the viscosity but also interfacial tension in the case of nonionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables simulation of real life conditions for a product eg tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times mechanical acceleration including vibration centrifugation and agitation are sometimes used they subject the product to different forces that pushes the particles  droplets against one another hence helping in the film drainage however some emulsions would never coalesce in normal gravity while they do under artificial gravity  moreover segregation of different populations of particles have been highlighted when using centrifugation and vibration  common examples of suspensions include

V the syrette is a device for injecting liquid through a needle it is similar to a syringe except that it has a closed flexible tube like that typically used for toothpaste instead of a rigid tube and piston it was developed by squibb now the bristolmyers squibb company the morphine syrette used in world war ii had a wire loop pin with a guard in the end of the hollow needle that was used to break a seal where the needle was attached to the tube it was similar to a superglue tube after breaking the seal the wire loop pin was removed and the hollow needle was inserted under the skin at a shallow angle and the tube flattened between the thumb and fingers see subcutaneous injection after injection the used tube was pinned to the receiving soldiers collar to inform others of the dose administered the us military also distributed atropine in syrettes chemical treatment was subsequently distributed in autoinjector form british syrette containing omnopon circa 1990s diagram showing wire loop pin syrette of morphine from wwii on display at the army medical services museum

V a drugeluting stent des is a peripheral or coronary stent a scaffold placed into narrowed diseased peripheral or coronary arteries that slowly releases a drug to block cell proliferation  this prevents fibrosis that together with clots thrombi could otherwise block the stented artery a process called restenosis the stent is usually placed within the peripheral or coronary artery by an interventional cardiologist or interventional radiologist during an angioplasty procedure  drugeluting stents in current clinical use were approved by the fda after clinical trials showed they were statistically superior to baremetal stents for the treatment of native coronary artery narrowings having lower rates of major adverse cardiac events usually defined as a composite clinical endpoint of death  myocardial infarction  repeat intervention because of restenosis    the first drugeluting stents to be approved in europe and the us were coated with paclitaxel or an mtor inhibitor such as sirolimus   clinical trials have shown the benefits of coronary stenting with baremetal stents over other methods of angioplasty including balloon angioplasty and atherectomy drugeluting stents des have also been extensively studied and are generally superior to baremetal stents as regards major adverse cardiac events mace generally defined as death myocardial infarction or the need for a repeat revascularization procedure stents are indicated to improve the diameter of the coronary artery lumen when narrowing generally because of atherosclerosis causes ischemia reduced oxygen delivery to the muscle supplied by that artery  drugeluting stents also have been shown to be superior to baremetal stents in reducing shortterm complications of stenting in saphenous vein grafts  however use in these bypass grafts is an example of an offlabel use of drugeluting stents that is this application has not been sufficiently examined by the food and drug administration for that agency to recommend the use for onlabel applications the fda believes that coronary drugeluting stents remain safe and effective when used for the fdaapproved indications these devices have significantly reduced the need for a second surgery to treat restenosis for thousands of patients each year  some concern has been expressed about overzealous use of stents in general two studies found about half of patients received stents for unapproved reasons   with worse outcomes for the patients in both studies more recent data suggest offlabel use of both baremetal stents and drugeluting stents have increased risks however drugeluting stents seemed to have similar or improved rates of death or mi compared with baremetal stents and consistently reduced need for target vessel revascularization overall the data support the use of drugeluting stents for offlabel indications  medical therapy for coronary artery disease has also improved since the 1970s and for many kinds of patients may be as successful as stenting or surgery for those requiring pci or surgery medical therapy and revascularization should be viewed as complementary rather than opposing strategies  coronary artery bypass graft surgery is the best treatment for some patients differences between outcomes with stenting and with coronary artery bypass surgery cabg are a point of controversy a recent study comparing the outcomes of all patients in new york state treated with cabg or percutaneous coronary intervention pci demonstrated cabg was superior to pci with des in multiple vessel coronary artery disease  patients treated with cabg had lower rates of death and of death or myocardial infarction than treatment with a drugeluting stent patients undergoing cabg also had lower rates of repeat revascularization  two major randomized controlled trials comparing cabg and des are either completed or ongoing and have published results  synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with taxus and cardiac surgery syntax and future revascularization evaluation in patients with diabetes mellitusoptimal management of multivessel disease freedom   the fiveyear followup results of syntax showed depending on the complexity of coronary vessel disease pci was either equally effective or inferior to cabg  similarly results from the freedom trial published after five years showed cabg to be superior to pci in reducing rates of death and myocardial infarction  both trials found either increased or insignificantly different rates of stroke with cabg as compared to pci the registries of the nonrandomized patients screened for these trials may provide as much robust data regarding revascularization outcomes as the randomized analysis  other studies including the arts ii registry suggest drugeluting stenting is not inferior to coronary bypass for treatment of multiplevessel coronary disease the arts ii registry compared a cohort of patients treated with multiplevessel stenting with des to the historical cabg cohort in the arts i trial itself a randomized comparison between multiplevessel baremetal stenting vs cabg at threeyear followup major adverse cardiac events were comparable between the arts ii des group and the arts i cabg group reintervention was lower in the arts i cabg group  in all comparison studies of stenting vs bypass surgery only a small minority of patients with multiplevessel coronary disease have been eligible for inclusion in the studies and for most patients clinical judgement by experienced operators suggest one or the other approach is preferred like all invasive medical procedures implanting stents in the coronary arteries carries risk for the newer drugeluting stents verylongterm results are not yet available however five years after implantation sirolimuseluting stents remained superior to baremetal stents  risks associated with cardiac catheterization procedures include bleeding allergic reaction to the xray contrast agents used to visualize the coronary arteries and myocardial infarction with pci the requirement for emergency cabg has markedly decreased since the days of balloon angioplasty such that in some communities coronary stenting is permitted in hospitals without onsite cardiac surgery facilities  though this remains highly controversial in the united states not the least because of the rare but largely unpredictable risk of coronary artery perforation  rarely a type of allergic reaction to the drug may occur episodes of fatality have been reported  although drugeluting stents continue to represent a major medical advance for angioplasty evidence has always shown new clot thrombosis formation with stents to be a problem thus clotting suppressant agents are routinely given during placement and anticlotting agents should be continued the question is for how long coronary arterial healing occurs after the placement of a drugeluting stent but complete healing of the vessel takes time for drugeluting stents the time course of complete healing in humans is unknown  a stent is a foreign object in the body and the body responds to the stents presence in a variety of ways macrophages accumulate around the stent and nearby smooth muscle cells proliferate these physiological changes which can cause restenosis are limited by the drugs released by the stent but these drugs also limit formation of a new endothelial layer over the new stent to inhibit clot formation endothelialization is a hallmark of vascular healing and is important for the prevention of thrombus formation lack of healing caused by antiproliferative drugs can make the stent an exposed surface on which a clot sometimes lifethreatening can form for drugeluting stents which by design delay formation of a new endothelium cover over the stent the incidence of clot formation within the stent may persist for a longer period of time perhaps as long as five years after treatment drugeluting stents have been associated with delayed arterial healing and the prevalence of latent thrombus after five years suggesting patients may continue to be at risk for stent thrombosis for an extended period of time  though less frequent with drugeluting stents neointimal proliferation can still occur in des and cause restenosis stent occlusion because of thrombosis may occur during the procedure in the following days or later the presence of thrombi around the stent may in turn affect the drugeluting performance of the stent  treatment with the antiplatelet drugs aspirin and clopidogrel appears to be the most important factor reducing this risk of thrombosis and early cessation of one or both of these drugs after drugeluting stenting markedly increases the risk of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction  a recent histopathology study showed very late des thrombosis is associated with histopathological signs of inflammation and intravascular ultrasound evidence of vessel remodeling compared with other causes of myocardial infarction eosinophilic infiltrates are more common in thrombi harvested from very late des thrombosis and correlate with the extent of stent malapposition  whether drugeluting stents are at higher risk than baremetal stents for late thrombosis is intensely debated  in metaanalyses of the sirolimus and paclitaxeleluting stent trials a small but statistically higher risk of thrombosis was shown after the first year compared to baremetal stents late stent thrombosis often causes myocardial infarction and sometimes death  in other analyses the late thrombosis risk is offset by drugeluting stents markedly reduced risk of restenosis and its complications including myocardial infarction a metaanalysis concluded the mortality risk associated with drugeluting and baremetal stents is similar  drugeluting stents generally consist of three parts  the stent platform a polymer coating that binds the drug to the stent and releases drug although stents have been tested that do without a coating and the drug  the stent platform itself is an expandable framework generally with an elaborate meshlike design to allow expansion flexibility and in some cases the ability to makeenlarge side openings for side vessels  the first des were stainless steel alloys composed of iron nickel and chromium and were based on existing bare metal stents  these stents were hard to visualize with medical imaging posed a risk of causing allergic responses and were difficult to deliver and subsequent new alloys were brought to bear namely cobaltchrome and platinum chrome with improved performance subsequently bioresorbable stents have been developed in which the stent itself dissolves over time  as of 2009 materials that had been explored included magnesium polylactic acid polycarbonate poylmers and salicylic acid polymers  resorbable stents have held the promise of providing an acute treatment that would eventually allow the vessel to function normally without leaving a permanent device behind   one to three or more layers of polymer can be used in the coating eg a base layer for adhesion a main layer that holds and elutes releases the drug into the arterial wall by contact transfer and sometimes a top coat to slow down the release of the drug and extend its effect the first few drugeluting stents to be licensed used durable coatings the first generation coatings appear to have caused immunological reactions at times and some possibly led to thrombosis which has driven experimentation and development of new coating approaches  the drug is mainly to inhibit neointimal growth due to proliferation of smooth muscle cells which would cause restenosis  much of the neointimal hyperplasia seems to be caused by inflammation hence immunosuppressive and antiproliferative drugs are used sirolimus paclitaxel and everolimus were previously used for other medical applications and have been included in licensed des  the first procedure to treat blocked coronary arteries was coronary artery bypass graft surgery cabg wherein a section of vein or artery from elsewhere in the body is used to bypass the diseased segment of coronary artery in 1977 andreas grntzig introduced percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca also called balloon angioplasty in which a catheter was introduced through a peripheral artery and a balloon expanded to dilate the narrowed segment of artery  as equipment and techniques improved the use of ptca rapidly increased and by the mid1980s ptca and cabg were being performed at equivalent rates  balloon angioplasty was generally effective and safe but restenosis was frequent occurring in about 3040 of cases usually within the first year after dilation in about 3 of balloon angioplasty cases failure of the dilation and acute or threatened closure of the coronary artery often because of dissection prompted emergency cabgs  dotter and melvin judkins had suggested using prosthetic devices inside arteries in the leg to maintain blood flow after dilation as early as 1964  in 1986 puel and sigwart implanted the first coronary stent in a human patient  several trials in the 1990s showed the superiority of stent placement over balloon angioplasty restenosis was reduced because the stent acted as a scaffold to hold open the dilated segment of artery acute closure of the coronary artery and the requirement for emergency cabg was reduced because the stent repaired dissections of the arterial wall by 1999 stents were used in 84 of percutaneous coronary interventions ie those done via a catheter and not by openchest surgery  early difficulties with coronary stents included a risk of early thrombosis clotting resulting in occlusion of the stent  coating stainless steel stents with other substances such as platinum or gold did not eliminate this problem  highpressure balloon expansion of the stent to ensure its full apposition to the arterial wall combined with drug therapy using aspirin and another inhibitor of platelet aggregation usually ticlopidine or clopidogrel nearly eliminated this risk of early stent thrombosis   though it occurred less frequently than with balloon angioplasty or other techniques stents nonetheless remained vulnerable to restenosis caused almost exclusively by neointimal tissue growth to address this issue developers of drugeluting stents used the devices themselves as a tool for delivering medication directly to the arterial wall while initial efforts were unsuccessful the release elution of drugs with certain specific physicochemical properties from the stent was shown in 2001 to achieve high concentrations of the drug locally directly at the target lesion with minimal systemic side effects  as currently used in clinical practice drugeluting stents refers to metal stents that elute a drug designed to limit the growth of neointimal scar tissue thus reducing the likelihood of stent restenosis  the first successful trials were of sirolimuseluting stents a clinical trial in 2002 led to approval of the sirolimuseluting cypher stent in europe in 2002 after a larger pivotal trial one designed for the purpose of achieving fda approval published in 2003 the device received fda approval and was released in the us in 2003  soon thereafter a series of trials of paclitaxeleluting stents led to fda approval of the taxus stent in 2004  the first resorbable stent tested in humans was developed by the igaki medical planning company in japan and was constructed from polyllactic acid a form of polylactic acid they published their initial results in 2000  the german company biotronik developed a magnesium absorbable stent and published clinical results in 2007  the first company to bring a bioresorbable stent to market was abbott vascular which received a european marketing approval in september 2012 the second was elixir which received its ce mark in may 2013   in 2012 a metaanalysis of clinical trial data was published showing that des has no benefit compared to treatment with drugs  the new york times interviewed the studys main author who said that more than half of patients with stable coronary artery disease were implanted with stents without even trying drug treatment and that he believed this happened because hospitals and doctors wanted to make more money  in 2013 the times of india reported that des were widely overused and that indian distributors used profits from high markups on des to bribe doctors to use them   in 2014 an investigation by the maharashtra food and drug administration found that high markups and bribery related to des was still widespread

V the general term nebulizer refers to an apparatus that converts liquids into a fine mist nozzles also convert liquids into a fine mist but do so by pressure through small holes nebulizers generally use gas flows to deliver the mist the most common form of nebulizers are medical appliances such as asthma inhalers or paint spray cans analytical nebulizers are a special category in that their purpose is to deliver a fine mist to spectrometric instruments for elemental analysis they are necessary parts of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icpoes inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms and atomic absorption spectroscopy aas   analytical nebulizers are used in trace element analysis this type of work plays an important role in areas of pharmaceutical and clinical study biological environmental and agricultural assessment and petroleum testing they also have nuclear applications most analytical pneumatic nebulizers use the same essential principle induction to atomize the liquid when gas at a higher pressure exits from a small hole the orifice into gas at a lower pressure it forms a gas jet into the lower pressure zone and pushes the lower pressure gas away from the orifice this creates a current in the lower pressure gas zone and draws some of the lower pressure gas into the higher pressure gas jet at the orifice the draw of the lower pressure gas creates considerable suction the extent depending on the differential pressures the size of the orifice and the shape of the orifice and surrounding apparatus in all pneumatic induction nebulizers the suction near the orifice is utilized to draw the liquid into the gas jet the liquid is broken into small droplets in the process present induction pneumatic nebulizer designs fit into 5 categories 1 concentric liquid flow surrounded by a gas flow or gas flow surrounded by a liquid flow 2 cross flow gas flow at right angles to the liquid flow 3 entrained gas and liquid mixed in the system and emitted as a combined flow 4 babington and v groove liquid is spread over a surface to decrease the surface tension and passed over a gas orifice 5 parallel path liquid is delivered beside a gas orifice and induction pulls the liquid into the gas stream newer noninduction nebulizers include 3 more categories 6 enhanced parallel path liquid is delivered beside a gas orifice and drawn into the gas stream by surface tension along a spout 7 flow blurring liquid is injected by pressure into a gas stream 8 vibrating mesh liquid is pushed through tiny holes by a vibrating ultrasonic plate concentric nebulizers have a central capillary with the liquid and an outer capillary with the gas the gas draws the liquid into the gas stream through induction and the liquid is broken into a fine mist as it moves into the gas stream in theory the gas and liquid may be switched with the gas in the center and the liquid in the outer capillary but generally they work better with the gas outside and the liquid inside  the first canadian concentric patent was canadian patent 2405 of april 18 1873 it was designed to deliver a better spray of oil into a burner the design is larger but essentially the same as modern analytical nebulizers the first one developed for spectrometers was a glass design developed by dr meinhard of california in 1973  his design enabled early icp users to have a consistent sample introduction nebulizer but it plugged easily today many companies produce glass concentrics and since 1997 teflon concentrics have become available cross flow nebulizers have a gas capillary set at right angles to the liquid capillary the gas is blown across the liquid capillary and this produces a low pressure that draws the liquid into the gas stream  generally the suction is similar to what is produced in a concentric nebulizer the benefit of a cross flow is that the liquid capillary have a larger id allowing for more particles to pass through without plugging the nebulizer the disadvantage is that the mist is usually not as fine or as consistent  there are no analytical nebulizers at present using this technique but some oil burners do mainly used in much older designs as newer concentrics and cross flows are much better and easier to make v groove nebulizers are similar to a cross flow in that the liquid is delivered in a capillary at right angles to the gas capillary but the liquid is poured down a vertically orientated groove that flows past a gas orifice the gas pulls the liquid into the gas flow and forms a fine mist these allow for very large id liquid capillaries but have no suction and require a pump to feed the liquid to the device they must be correctly orientated or they do not allow the liquid to flow past the gas stream and their mist usually produces larger droplets than with concentrics or cross flows this design was developed by john burgener of burgener research inc here the gas stream and sample run through the nebulizer in parallel capillaries at the tip of the nebulizer the liquid is pulled into the gas stream and then dispersed into the chamber as a mist this design was developed by john burgener of burgener research inc  here the gas stream and sample run through the nebulizer in parallel capillaries at the tip of the nebulizer the liquid is pulled into the gas stream by surface tension along a spout dipping into the gas stream this allows the gas and liquid to interact in the center of the gas flow where the gas flow speed is highest producing a better transfer of energy from the gas to the liquid and producing a finer droplet size this is a new type of nebulizer which does not use induction to mix the sample and gas instead pneumatic atomization is employed here which results in the micromixing of fluids using a reflux cell  this means that there is a turbulent mixing of the liquid and gas which results in great sensitivity and is very efficient the oneneb is the only example of this sort since 2011 this variation on ultrasonic nebulizers has been available there is a vibrating membrane which has micro holes in it the sample enters through the back and is pushed through the holes as the membrane vibrates this makes a fine mist with a droplet size proportional to the hole size this method requires no gas flow and is used in conjunction with a chamber if the droplets are less than 5\u03bcm then they are too small to stick to the chamber walls and the chamber remains dry while 90100 of the sample makes it to the torch the early history of medical nebulizers can be read

V in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals encapsulation refers to a range of dosage formstechniques used to enclose medicinesin a relatively stable shell known as a capsule allowing them to for example be taken orally or be used as suppositories the two main types of capsules are both of these classes of capsules are made from aqueous solutions of gelling agents like other ingredients can be added to the gelling agent solution like plasticizers such as glycerin or sorbitol to decrease the capsules hardness coloring agents preservatives disintegrants lubricants and surface treatment since their inception capsules have been viewed by consumers as the most efficient method of taking medication for this reason producers of drugs such as otc analgesics wanting to emphasize the strength of their product developed the caplet or capsuleshaped tablet in order to tie this positive association to more efficientlyproduced tablet pills after the 1982 tylenol tampering murders capsules experienced a minor fall in popularity as tablets were seen as more resistant to tampering    in 1834 mothes and dublanc were granted a patent for a method to produce a singlepiece gelatin capsule that was sealed with a drop of gelatin solution they used individual iron moulds for their process filling the capsules individually with a medicine dropper later on methods were developed that used sets of plates with pockets to form the capsules although some companies still use this method the equipment is not produced commercially any more all modern softgel encapsulation uses variations of a process developed by r p scherer in 1933 his innovation was to use a rotary die to produce the capsules with the filling taking place by blow molding this method reduced wastage and was the first process to yield capsules with highly repeatable dosage the current owner of schrerers technology is catalent pharma solutions the worlds largest manufacturer of prescription pharmaceutical softgels softgels can be an effective delivery system for oral drugs especially poorly soluble drugs this is because the fill can contain liquid ingredients that help increase solubility or permeability of the drug across the membranes in the body liquid ingredients are difficult to include in any other solid dosage form such as a tablet softgels are also highly suited to potent drugs for example where the dose is 100g where the highly reproducible filling process helps ensure each softgel has the same drug content and because the operators are not exposed to any drug dust during the manufacturing process in 1949 the lederle laboratories division of the american cyanamid company developed the accogel process allowing powders to be accurately filled into soft gelatin capsules james murdock of london patented the twopiece telescoping gelatin capsule in 1847  the capsules are made in two parts by dipping metal pins in the gelling agent solution the capsules are supplied as closed units to the pharmaceutical manufacturer before use the two halves are separated the capsule is filled with powder or more normally pellets made by the process of extrusion  spheronization either by placing a compressed slug of powder into one half of the capsule or by filling one half of the capsule with loose powder and the other half of the capsule is pressed on with the compressed slug method weight varies less between capsules however the machinery required to manufacture them is more complex  the powder or spheroids inside the capsule contains the active ingredients and any excipients such as binders disintegrants fillers glidant and preservatives gelatin capsules informally called gel caps or gelcaps are composed of gelatin manufactured from the collagen of animal skin or bone  vegetable capsules are composed of hypromellose a polymer formulated from cellulose the process of encapsulation of hard gelatin capsules can be done on manual semiautomatic and automatic machines softgels are filled at the same time as they are produced and sealed on the rotary die of a fully automatic machine

V cell microencapsulation technology involves immobilization of the cells within a polymeric semipermeable membrane that permits the bidirectional diffusion of molecules such as the influx of oxygen nutrients growth factors etc essential for cell metabolism and the outward diffusion of waste products and therapeutic proteins at the same time the semipermeable nature of the membrane prevents immune cells and antibodies from destroying the encapsulated cells regarding them as foreign invaders the main motive of cell encapsulation technology is to overcome the existing problem of graft rejection in tissue engineering applications and thus reduce the need for longterm use of immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplant to control side effects   in 1933 vincenzo bisceglie made the first attempt to encapsulate cells in polymer membranes he demonstrated that tumor cells in a polymer structure transplanted into pig abdominal cavity remained viable for a long period without being rejected by the immune system  thirty years later in 1964 the idea of encapsulating cells within ultra thin polymer membrane microcapsules so as to provide immunoprotection to the cells was then proposed by thomas chang who introduced the term artificial cells to define this concept of bioencapsulation  he suggested that these artificial cells produced by a drop method not only protected the encapsulated cells from immunorejection but also provided a high surfacetovolume relationship enabling good mass transfer of oxygen and nutrients  twenty years later this approach was successfully put into practice in small animal models when alginatepolylysinealginate apa microcapsules immobilizing xenograft islet cells were developed  the study demonstrated that when these microencapsulated islets were implanted into diabetic rats the cells remained viable and controlled glucose levels for several weeks human trials utilising encapsulated cells were performed in 1998    encapsulated cells expressing a cytochrome p450 enzyme to locally activate an antitumour prodrug were used in a trial for advanced nonresectable pancreatic cancer approximately a doubling of survival time compared to historic controls was demonstrated questions could arise as to why the technique of encapsulation of cells is even required when therapeutic products could just be injected at the site an important reason for this is that the encapsulated cells would provide a source of sustained continuous release of therapeutic products for longer durations at the site of implantation another advantage of cell microencapsulation technology is that it allows the loading of nonhuman and genetically modified cells into the polymer matrix when the availability of donor cells is limited  microencapsulation is a valuable technique for local regional and oral delivery of therapeutic products as it can be implanted into numerous tissue types and organs for prolonged drug delivery to the treatment site implantation of these drug loaded artificial cells would be more cost effective in comparison to direct drug delivery moreover the prospect of implanting artificial cells with similar chemical composition in several patients irrespective of their leukocyte antigen could again allow reduction in costs  the potential of using cell microencapsulation in successful clinical applications can be realized only if several requirements encountered during the development process are optimized such as the use of an appropriate biocompatible polymer to form the mechanically and chemically stable semipermeable matrix production of uniformly sized microcapsules use of an appropriate immunecompatible polycations crosslinked to the encapsulation polymer to stabilized the capsules selection of a suitable cell type depending on the situation the use of the best biomaterial depending on the application is crucial in the development of drug delivery systems and tissue engineering the polymer alginate is very commonly used due to its early discovery easy availability and low cost but other materials such as cellulose sulphate collagen chitosan gelatin and agarose have also been employed several groups have extensively studied several natural and synthetic polymers with the goal of developing the most suitable biomaterial for cell microencapsulation   extensive work has been done using alginates which are regarded as the most suitable biomaterials for cell microencapsulation due to their abundance excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability properties alginate is a natural polymer which can be extracted from seaweed and bacteria  with numerous compositions based on the isolation source  alginate is not free from all criticism some researchers believe that alginates with highm content could produce an inflammatory response   and an abnormal cell growth  while some have demonstrated that alginate with highg content lead to an even higher cell overgrowth   and inflammatory reaction in vivo as compared to intermediateg alginates   even ultrapure alginates may contain endotoxins and polyphenols which could compromise the biocompatibility of the resultant cell microcapsules    it has been shown that even though purification processes successfully lower endotoxin and polyphenol content in the processed alginate it is difficult to lower the protein content  and the purification processes could in turn modify the properties of the biomaterial  thus it is essential that an effective purification process is designed so as to remove all the contaminants from alginate before it can be successfully used in clinical applications researchers have also been able to develop alginate microcapsules with an altered form of alginate with enhanced biocompatibility and higher resistance to osmotic swelling   another approach to increasing the biocompatibility of the membrane biomaterial is through surface modification of the capsules using peptide and protein molecules which in turn controls the proliferation and rate of differentiation of the encapsulated cells one group that has been working extensively on coupling the amino acid sequence argglyasp rgd to alginate hydrogels demonstrated that the cell behavior can be controlled by the rgd density coupled on the alginate gels alginate microparticles loaded with myoblast cells and functionalized with rgd allowed control over the growth and differentiation of the loaded cells   another vital factor that controls the use of cell microcapsules in clinical applications is the development of a suitable immunecompatible polycation to coat the otherwise highly porous alginate beads and thus impart stability and immune protection to the system  polyllysine is the most commonly used polycation but its low biocompatibility restricts the successful clinical use of these pll formulated microcapsules which attract inflammatory cells thus inducing necrosis of the loaded cells  studies have also shown that alginatepllalginate apa microcapsules demonstrate low mechanical stability and short term durability thus several research groups have been looking for alternatives to pll and have demonstrated promising results with polylornithine  and polymethylenecoguanidine hydrochloride  by fabricating durable microcapsules with high and controlled mechanical strength for cell encapsulation several groups have also investigated the use of chitosan which is a naturally derived polycation as a potential replacement for pll to fabricate alginatechitosan ac microcapsules for cell delivery applications   however studies have also shown that the stability of this ac membrane is again limited   and one group demonstrated that modification of this alginatechitosan microcapsules with genipin a naturally occurring iridoid glucosid from gardenia fruits to form genipin crosslinked alginatechitosan gcac microcapsules could augment stability of the cell loaded microcapsules  collagen a major protein component of the ecm provides support to tissues like skin cartilage bones blood vessels and ligaments and is thus considered a model scaffold or matrix for tissue engineering due to its properties of biocompatibility biodegradability and ability to promote cell binding  this ability allows chitosan to control distribution of cells inside the polymeric system thus typei collagen obtained from animal tissues is now successfully being used commercially as tissue engineered biomaterial for multiple applications  collagen has also been used in nerve repair  and bladder engineering  immunogenicity has limited the applications of collagen gelatin has been considered as an alternative for that reason  gelatin is prepared from the denaturation of collagen and many desirable properties such as biodegradability biocompatibility nonimmunogenity in physiological environments and easy processability make this polymer a good choice for tissue engineering applications  it is used in engineering tissues for the skin bone and cartilage and is used commercially for skin replacements  chitosan is a polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed \u03b214linked dglucosamine deacetylated unit and nacetyldglucosamine acetylated unit it is derived from the ndeacetylation of chitin and has been used for several applications such as drug delivery  spacefilling implants  and in wound dressings  however one drawback of this polymer is its weak mechanical properties and is thus often combined with other polymers such collagen to form a polymer with stronger mechanical properties for cell encapsulation applications  agarose is a polysaccharide derived from seaweed used for nanoencapsulation of cells and the cellagarose suspension  can be modified to form microbeads by reducing the temperature during preparation  however one drawback with the microbeads so obtained is the possibility of cellular protrusion through the polymeric matrix wall after formation of the capsules cellulose sulphate is derived from cotton and once processed appropriately can be used as a biocompatible base in which to suspend cells when the polyanionic cellulose sulphate solution is immersed in a second polycationic solution eg pdadmac a semipermeable membrane is formed around the suspended cells as a result of gelation between the two polyions both mammalian cell lines and bacterial cells remain viable and continue to replicate within the capsule membrane in order to fillout the capsule as such in contrast to some other encapsulation materials the capsules can be used to grow cells and act as such like a minibioreactor the biocompatible nature of the material has been demonstrated by observation during studies using the cellfilled capsules themselves for implantation as well as isolated capsule material  capsules formed from cellulose sulphate have been successfully used showing safety and efficacy in clinical and preclinical trials in both humans and animals primarily as anticancer treatments but also exploring possible uses for gene therapy or antibody therapies      using cellulose sulphate it has been possible to manufacture encapsulated cells as a pharmaceutical product at large scale and fulfilling good manufacturing process cgmp standards this was achieved by the company austrianova in 2007  the use of an ideal high quality biomaterial with the inherent properties of biocompatibility is the most crucial factor that governs the long term efficiency of this technology an ideal biomaterial for cell encapsulation should be one that is totally biocompatible does not trigger an immune response in the host and does not interfere with cell homeostasis so as to ensure high cell viability  however one major limitation has been the inability to reproduce the different biomaterials and the requirements to obtain a better understanding of the chemistry and biofunctionality of the biomaterials and the microencapsulation system  several studies demonstrate that surface modification of these cell containing microparticles allows control over the growth and cellular differentiation   of the encapsulated cells  one study proposed the use of zeta potential which measures the electric charge of the microcapsule as a means to predict the interfacial reaction between microcapsule and the surrounding tissue and in turn the biocompatibility of the delivery system  a fundamental criterion that must be established while developing any device with a semipermeable membrane is to adjust the permeability of the device in terms of entry and exit of molecules   it is essential that the cell microcapsule is designed with uniform thickness and should have a control over both the rate of molecules entering the capsule necessary for cell viability and the rate of therapeutic products and waste material exiting the capsule membrane immunoprotection of the loaded cell is the key issue that must be kept in mind while working on the permeability of the encapsulation membrane as not only immune cells but also antibodies and cytokines should be prevented entry into the microcapsule which in fact depends on the pore size of the biomembrane  it has been shown that since different cell types have different metabolic requirements thus depending on the cell type encapsulated in the membrane the permeability of the membrane has to be optimized  several groups have been dedicated towards the study of membrane permeability of cell microcapsules   and although the role of permeability of certain essential elements like oxygen has been demonstrated  the permeability requirements of each cell type are yet to be determined it is essential that the microcapsules have adequate membrane strength mechanical stability to endure physical and osmotic stress such as during the exchange of nutrients and waste products the microcapsules should be strong enough and should not rupture on implantation as this could lead to an immune rejection of the encapsulated cells  for instance in the case of xenotransplantation a tighter more stable membrane would be required in comparison to allotransplantation also while investigating the potential of using apa microcapsules loaded with bile salt hydrolase bsh overproducing active lactobacillus plantarum 80 cells in a simulated gastro intestinal tract model for oral delivery applications the mechanical integrity and shape of the microcapsules was evaluated it was shown that apa microcapsules could potentially be used in the oral delivery of live bacterial cells  however further research proved that the gcac microcapsules possess a higher mechanical stability as compared to apa microcapsules for oral delivery applications  martoni et al were experimenting with bacteriafilled capsules that would be taken by mouth to reduce serum cholesterol the capsules were pumped through a series of vessels simulating the human gi tract to determine how well the capsules would survive in the body extensive research into the mechanical properties of the biomaterial to be used for cell microencapsulation is necessary to determine the durability of the microcapsules during production and especially for in vivo applications where a sustained release of the therapeutic product over long durations is required the diameter of the microcapsules is an important factor that influences both the immune response towards the cell microcapsules as well as the mass transport across the capsule membrane studies show that the cellular response to smaller capsules is much lesser as compared to larger capsules  and in general the diameter of the cell loaded microcapsules should be between 350450m so as to enable effective diffusion across the semipermeable membrane   the cell type chosen for this technique depends on the desired application of the cell microcapsules the cells put into the capsules can be from the patient autologous cells from another donor allogeneic cells or from other species xenogeneic cells  the use of autologous cells in microencapsulation therapy is limited by the availability of these cells and even though xenogeneic cells are easily accessible danger of possible transmission of viruses especially porcine endogenous retrovirus to the patient restricts their clinical application  and after much debate several groups have concluded that studies should involve the use of allogeneic instead of xenogeneic cells  depending on the application the cells can be genetically altered to express any required protein  however enough research has to be carried out to validate the safety and stability of the expressed gene before these types of cells can be used this technology has not received approval for clinical trial because of the high immunogenicity of cells loaded in the capsules they secrete cytokines and produce a severe inflammatory reaction at the implantation site around the capsules in turn leading to a decrease in viability of the encapsulated cells   one promising approach being studied is the administration of antiinflammatory drugs to reduce the immune response produced due to administration of the cell loaded microcapsules   another approach which is now the focus of extensive research is the use of stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells for long term cell microencapsulation and cell therapy applications in hopes of reducing the immune response in the patient after implantation  another issue which compromises long term viability of the microencapsulated cells is the use of fast proliferating cell lines which eventually fill up the entire system and lead to decrease in the diffusion efficiency across the semipermeable membrane of the capsule  a solution to this could be in the use of cell types such as myoblasts which do not proliferate after the microencapsulation procedure probiotics are increasingly being used in numerous dairy products such as ice cream milk powders yoghurts frozen dairy desserts and cheese due to their important health benefits but low viability of probiotic bacteria in the food still remains a major hurdle the ph dissolved oxygen content titratable acidity storage temperature species and strains of associative fermented dairy product organisms and concentration of lactic and acetic acids are some of the factors that greatly affect the probiotic viability in the product    as set by food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations and the world health organization who the standard in order to be considered a health food with probitic addition the product should contain per gram at least 10 10  cfu of viable probiotic bacteria  it is necessary that the bacterial cells remain stable and healthy in the manufactured product are sufficiently viable while moving through the upper digestive tract and are able to provide positive effects upon reaching the intestine of the host  cell microencapsulation technology has successfully been applied in the food industry for the encapsulation of live probiotic bacteria cells to increase viability of the bacteria during processing of dairy products and for targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal tract  apart from dairy products microencapsulated probiotics have also been used in nondairy products such as theresweettm which is a sweetener it can be used as a convenient vehicle for delivery of encapsulated lactobacillus to the intestine although it is not itself a dairy product the potential of using bioartificial pancreas for treatment of diabetes mellitus based on encapsulating islet cells within a semi permeable membrane is extensively being studied by scientists these devices could eliminate the need for of immunosuppressive drugs in addition to finally solving the problem of shortage of organ donors the use of microencapsulation would protect the islet cells from immune rejection as well as allow the use of animal cells or genetically modified insulinproducing cells  it is hoped that development of these islet encapsulated microcapsules could prevent the need for the insulin injections needed several times a day by type 1 diabetic patients  the edmonton protocol involves implantation of human islets extracted from cadaveric donors and has shown improvements towards the treatment of type 1 diabetics who are prone to hypoglycemic unawareness  however the two major hurdles faced in this technique are the limited availability of donor organs and with the need for immunosuppresents to prevent an immune response in the patients body several studies have been dedicated towards the development of bioartificial pancreas involving the immobilization of islets of langerhans inside polymeric capsules the first attempt towards this aim was demonstrated in 1980 by lim et al where xenograft islet cells were encapsulated inside alginate polylysine microcapsules and showed significant in vivo results for several weeks  it is envisaged that the implantation of these encapsulated cells would help to overcome the use of immunosuppressive drugs and also allow the use of xenograft cells thus obviating the problem of donor shortage the polymers used for islet microencapsulation are alginate  chitosan  polyethylene glycol peg  agarose  sodium cellulose sulfate and waterinsoluble polyacrylates with alginate and peg being commonly used polymers with successful in vitro studies being performed using this technique significant work in clinical trials using microencapsulated human islets is being carried out in 2003 the use of alginateplo microcapsules containing islet cells for pilot phase1 clinical trials was permitted to be carried out at the university of perugia by the italian ministry of health  in another study the potential of clinical application of pegylation and low doses of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine a were evaluated the trial which began in 2005 by novocell now forms the phase iii of clinical trials involving implantation of islet allografts into the subcutaneous site  however there have been controversial studies involving human clinical trials where living cell technologies ltd demonstrated the survival of functional xenogeneic cells transplanted without immunosuppressive medication for 95 years  however the trial received harsh criticism from the international xenotransplantation association as being risky and premature  however even though clinical trials are under way several major issues such as biocompatibility and immunoprotection need to be overcome  potential alternatives to encapsulating isolated islets of either allo or xenogeneic origin are also being explored using sodium cellulose sulphate technology from austrianova singapore an islet cell line was encapsulated and it was demonstrated that the cells remain viable and release insulin in response to glucose  in preclinical studies implanted encapsulated cells were able to restore blood glucose levels in diabetic rats over a period of 6 months  the use of cell encapsulated microcapsules towards the treatment of several forms of cancer has shown great potential one approach undertaken by researchers is through the implantation of microcapsules containing genetically modified cytokine secreting cells an example of this was demonstrated by cirone et al when genetically modified il2 cytokine secreting nonautologous mouse myoblasts implanted into mice showed a delay in the tumor growth with an increased rate of survival of the animals  however the efficiency of this treatment was brief due to an immune response towards the implanted microcapsules another approach to cancer suppression is through the use of angiogenesis inhibitors to prevent the release of growth factors which lead to the spread of tumors the effect of implanting microcapsules loaded with xenogenic cells genetically modified to secrete endostatin an antiangiogenic drug which causes apoptosis in tumor cells has been extensively studied   however this method of local delivery of microcapsules was not feasible in the treatment of patients with many tumors or in metastasis cases and has led to recent studies involving systemic implantation of the capsules   in 1998 a murine model of pancreatic cancer was used to study the effect of implanting genetically modified cytochrome p450 expressing feline epithelial cells encapsulated in cellulose sulfate polymers for the treatment of solid tumors  the approach demonstrated for the first time the application of enzyme expressing cells to activate chemotherapeutic agents on the basis of these results an encapsulated cell therapy product novacaps was tested in a phaseiii clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in patients   and has recently been designated by the european medicines agency emea as an orphan drug in europe a further phase iii clinical trial using the same product confirmed the results of the first trial demonstrating an approximate doubling of survival time in patients with stage iv pancreatic cancer  in all of these trials using cellulose sulphate in addition to the clear antitumour effects the capsules were well tolerated and there were no adverse reactions seen such as immune response to the capsules demonstrating the biocompatible nature of the cellulose sulphate capsules in one patient the capsules were in place for almost 2 years with no side effects these studies show the promising potential application of cell microcapsules towards the treatment of cancers  however solutions to issues such as immune response leading to inflammation of the surrounding tissue at the site of capsule implantation have to be researched in detail before more clinical trials are possible numerous studies have been dedicated towards the development of effective methods to enable cardiac tissue regeneration in patients after ischemic heart disease an emerging approach to answer the problems related to ischemic tissue repair is though the use of stem cellbased therapy  however the actual mechanism due to which this stem cellbased therapy has generative effects on cardiac function is still under investigation even though numerous methods have been studied for cell administration the efficiency of the number of cells retained in the beating heart after implantation is still very low a promising approach to overcome this problem is through the use of cell microencapsulation therapy which has shown to enable a higher cell retention as compared to the injection of free stem cells into the heart  another strategy to improve the impact of cell based encapsulation technique towards cardiac regenerative applications is through the use of genetically modified stem cells capable of secreting angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor vegf which stimulate neovascularization and restore perfusion in the damaged ischemic heart   an example of this is shown in the study by zang et al where genetically modified xenogeneic cho cells expressing vegf were encapsulated in alginatepolylysinealginate microcapsules and implanted into rat myocardium   it was observed that the encapsulation protected the cells from an immunorespone for three weeks and also led to an improvement in the cardiac tissue postinfarction due to increased angiogenesis the use of monoclonal antibodies for therapy is now widespread for treatment of cancers and inflammatory diseases using cellulose sulphate technology scientists have successfully encapsulated antibody producing hybridoma cells and demonstrated subsequent release of the therapeutic antibody from the capsules   the capsules containing the hybridoma cells were used in preclinical studies to deliver neutralising antibodies to the mouse retrovirus frcase successfully preventing disease many other medical conditions have been targeted with encapsulation therapies especially those involving a deficiency in some biologically derived protein one of the most successful approaches is an external device that acts similarly to a dialysis machine only with a reservoir of pig hepatocytes surrounding the semipermeable portion of the bloodinfused tubing  this apparatus can remove toxins from the blood of patients suffering severe liver failure other applications that are still in development include cells that produce ciliaryderived neurotrophic factor for the treatment of als and huntingtons disease glialderived neurotrophic factor for parkinsons disease erythropoietin for anemia and hgh for dwarfism  in addition monogeneic diseases such as haemophilia gauchers disease and some mucopolysaccharide disorders could also potentially be targeted by encapsulated cells expressing the protein that is otherwise lacking in the patient

V an orally disintegrating tablet odt is a drug dosage form available for a limited range of overthecounter otc and prescription medications odts differ from traditional tablets in that they are designed to be dissolved on the tongue rather than swallowed whole            the odt serves as an alternative dosage form for patients who experience dysphagia difficulty in swallowing or for where compliance is a known issue and therefore an easier dosage form to take ensures that medication is taken common among all age groups dysphagia is observed in about 35 of the general population as well as up to 60 of the elderly institutionalized population    and 1822 of all patients in longterm care facilities   during the last decade odts have become available in a variety of therapeutic markets both otc and by prescription an additional reason to use an odts is the convenience of a tablet that can be taken without water   tablets designed to dissolve on the buccal cheek mucous membrane were a precursor to the odt this dosage form was intended for drugs that yield low bioavailability through the digestive tract but are inconvenient to administer parenterally such as steroids and narcotic analgesics  absorption through the cheek allows the drug to bypass the digestive tract for rapid systemic distribution not all odts have buccal absorption and many have similar absorption and bioavailability to standard oral dosage forms with the primary route remaining gi absorption however a fast disintegration time and a small tablet weight can enhance absorption in the buccal area the first odts disintegrated through effervescence rather than dissolution and were designed to make taking vitamins more pleasant for children  this method was adapted to pharmaceutical use with the invention of microparticles containing a drug which would be released upon effervescence of the tablet and swallowed by the patient  dissolution became more effective than effervescence through improved manufacturing processes and ingredients such as the addition of mannitol to increase binding and decrease dissolution time  catalent pharma solutions formerly scherer dds in the uk cima labs and fuisz technologies whose founder richard fuisz went on to pioneer orally soluble films a separate but related dosage form in the us and takeda pharmaceutical company in japan led the development of odts the first odt form of a drug to get approval from the us food and drug administration fda was a zydis odt formation of claritin loratadine in december 1996  it was followed by a zydis odt formulation of klonopin clonazepam in december 1997  and a zydis odt formulation of maxalt rizatriptan in june 1998  the regulatory condition for meeting the definition of an orally disintegrating tablet is usp method 701 for disintegration fda guidance issued in dec 2008 is that odt drugs should disintegrate in less than 30 seconds  this practice is under review by the fda as the fast disintegration time of odts makes the disintegration test too rigorous for some of the odt formulations that are commercially available the processes used to manufacture orally disintegrating tablets include loose compression tabletting a process which is not very different than the manufacturing method used for traditional tablets and lyophilization processes in loose compression odts are compressed at much lower forces 4  20 kn than traditional tablets however since odts are compressed at very low forces due to the need to them to be soft enough to disintegrate rapidly in the mouth issues of material sticking to the die walls can be challenging typically as in most tablet blends lubricants such as magnesium stearate are added to the blend to reduce the amount of material that may stick to the die wall differences may be the use of disintegrating aids such as crospovidone and binding agents that aid in mouth feel such as microcrystalline cellulose primarily odts contain some form of sugar such as mannitol which typically serves as the major diluent of the odts and is also the primary contributor to the smooth and creamy mouth feel of most odts lyophilized odt formulations may use proprietary technologies but can produce a tablet that has a faster disintegration rate for example the zydis odt typically dissolves in the mouth in less than 5 seconds without water odts are available in hpde bottles parcopa or individually sealed in blister packs to protect the tablets from damage moisture and oxidation because odts are soft in nature the ability to successfully package an odt in a bottle is difficult however cima labs markets their durasolv odt as being able to be placed into bottle for commercial sale while cimas orasolv is marketed for blisters only zydis odt tablets manufactured by catalent pharma solutions are delivered in a blister pack the differences between the two cima products are proprietary however the primary difference is expected to be the use of microcrystalline cellulose mcc such as avicel ph101 in the durasolv product mcc serves multiple purposes in an odt but in the case of cimas products it acts as a binder

V an anaesthetic vaporizer is a device generally attached to an anaesthetic machine which delivers a given concentration of a volatile anaesthetic agent it works by controlling the vaporisation of anaesthetic agents from liquid and then accurately controlling the concentration in which these are added to the fresh gas flow the design of these devices takes account of varying   there are generally two types of vaporizers plenum and drawover both have distinct advantages and disadvantages the dualcircuit gasvapour blender is a third type of vaporizer used exclusively for the agent desflurane the plenum vaporizer is driven by positive pressure from the anaesthetic machine and is usually mounted on the machine the performance of the vaporizer does not change regardless of whether the patient is breathing spontaneously or is mechanically ventilated the internal resistance of the vaporizer is usually high but because the supply pressure is constant the vaporizer can be accurately calibrated to deliver a precise concentration of volatile anaesthetic vapour over a wide range of fresh gas flows the plenum vaporizer is an elegant device which works reliably without external power for many hundreds of hours of continuous use and requires very little maintenance the plenum vaporizer works by accurately splitting the incoming gas into two streams one of these streams passes straight through the vaporizer in the bypass channel the other is diverted into the vaporising chamber gas in the vaporising chamber becomes fully saturated with volatile anaesthetic vapour this gas is then mixed with the gas in the bypass channel before leaving the vaporizer a typical volatile agent isoflurane has a saturated vapour pressure of 32kpa about 13 of an atmosphere this means that the gas mixture leaving the vaporising chamber has a partial pressure of isoflurane of 32kpa at sealevel atmospheric pressure is about 101kpa this equates conveniently to a concentration of 32 however the output of the vaporizer is typically set at 12 which means that only a very small proportion of the fresh gas needs to be diverted through the vaporising chamber this proportion is known as the splitting ratio it can also be seen that a plenum vaporizer can only work one way round if it is connected in reverse much larger volumes of gas enter the vaporising chamber and therefore potentially toxic or lethal concentrations of vapour may be delivered technically although the dial of the vaporizer is calibrated in volume percent eg 2 what it actually delivers is a partial pressure of anaesthetic agent eg 2kpa the performance of the plenum vaporizer depends extensively on the saturated vapour pressure of the volatile agent this is unique to each agent so it follows that each agent must only be used in its own specific vaporizer several safety systems such as the frasersweatman system have been devised so that filling a plenum vaporizer with the wrong agent is extremely difficult a mixture of two agents in a vaporizer could result in unpredictable performance from the vaporizer saturated vapour pressure for any one agent varies with temperature and plenum vaporizers are designed to operate within a specific temperature range they have several features designed to compensate for temperature changes especially cooling by evaporation they often have a metal jacket weighing about 5kg which equilibrates with the temperature in the room and provides a source of heat in addition the entrance to the vaporising chamber is controlled by a bimetallic strip which admits more gas to the chamber as it cools to compensate for the loss of efficiency of evaporation the first temperaturecompensated plenum vaporizer was the cyprane fluotec halothane vaporizer released onto the market shortly after halothane was introduced into clinical practice in 1956 the drawover vaporizer is driven by negative pressure developed by the patient and must therefore have a low resistance to gas flow its performance depends on the minute volume of the patient its output drops with increasing minute ventilation the design of the drawover vaporizer is much simpler in general it is a simple glass reservoir mounted in the breathing attachment drawover vaporizers may be used with any liquid volatile agent including older agents such as diethyl ether or chloroform although it would be dangerous to use desflurane because the performance of the vaporizer is so variable accurate calibration is impossible however many designs have a lever which adjusts the amount of fresh gas which enters the vaporising chamber the drawover vaporizer may be mounted either way round and may be used in circuits where rebreathing takes place or inside the circle breathing attachment drawover vaporizers typically have no temperature compensating features with prolonged use the liquid agent may cool to the point where condensation and even frost may form on the outside of the reservoir this cooling impairs the efficiency of the vaporizer one way of minimising this effect is to place the vaporizer in a bowl of water the relative inefficiency of the drawover vaporizer contributes to its safety a more efficient design would produce too much anaesthetic vapour the output concentration from a drawover vaporizer may greatly exceed that produced by a plenum vaporizer especially at low flows for safest use the concentration of anaesthetic vapour in the breathing attachment should be continuously monitored despite its drawbacks the drawover vaporizer is cheap to manufacture and easy to use in addition its portable design means that it can be used in the field or in veterinary anaesthesia the third category of vaporizer a dualcircuit gasvapour blender was created specifically for the agent desflurane desflurane boils at 235c which is very close to room temperature this means that at normal operating temperatures the saturated vapour pressure of desflurane changes greatly with only small fluctuations in temperature this means that the features of a normal plenum vaporizer are not sufficient to ensure an accurate concentration of desflurane additionally on a very warm day all the desflurane would boil and very high potentially lethal concentrations of desflurane might reach the patient a desflurane vaporizer eg the tec 6 produced by datexohmeda is heated to 39c and pressurised to 200kpa and therefore requires electrical power it is mounted on the anaesthetic machine in the same way as a plenum vaporizer but its function is quite different it evaporates a chamber containing desflurane using heat and injects small amounts of pure desflurane vapour into the fresh gas flow a transducer senses the fresh gas flow a warmup period is required after switching on the desflurane vaporizer will fail if mains power is lost alarms sound if the vaporizer is nearly empty an electronic display indicates the level of desflurane in the vaporizer the expense and complexity of the desflurane vaporizer have contributed to the relative lack of popularity of desflurane although in recent years it is gaining in popularity historically ether the first volatile agent was first used by john snows inhaler 1847 but was superseded by the use of chloroform 1848 ether then slowly made a revival 18621872 with regular use via curt schimmelbuschs mask a narcosis mask for dripping liquid ether now obsolete it was a mask constructed of wire and covered with cloth pressure and demand from dental surgeons for a more reliable method of administrating ether helped modernise its delivery in 1877 clover invented an ether inhaler with a water jacket and by the late 1899 alternatives to ether came to the fore mainly due to the introduction of spinal anaesthesia subsequently this resulted in the decline of ether 19301956 use due to the introduction of cyclopropane trichloroethylene and halothane by the 1980s the anaesthetic vaporizer had evolved considerably subsequent modifications lead to a raft of additional safety features such as temperature compensation a bimetallic strip temperatureadjusted splitting ratio and antispill measures

V koninklijke philips nv royal philips commonly known as philips is a dutch technology company headquartered in amsterdam with primary divisions focused in the areas of electronics healthcare and lighting it was founded in eindhoven in 1891 by gerard philips and his father frederik it is one of the largest electronics companies in the world and employs around 105000 people across more than 60 countries  philips is organized into three main divisions philips consumer lifestyle formerly philips consumer electronics and philips domestic appliances and personal care philips healthcare formerly philips medical systems and philips lighting as of 2012 philips was the largest manufacturer of lighting in the world measured by applicable revenues  in 2013 the company announced the sale of the bulk of its remaining consumer electronics operations to japans funai electric co  but in october 2013 the deal to funai electric co was broken off and the consumer electronics operations remain under philips philips said it would seek damages for breach of contract in the 200million sale  philips has a primary listing on the euronext amsterdam stock exchange and is a component of the euro stoxx 50 stock market index  it has a secondary listing on the new york stock exchange the philips company was founded in 1891 by gerard philips and his father frederik frederik a banker based in zaltbommel financed the purchase and setup of a modest empty factory building in eindhoven where the company started the production of carbonfilament lamps and other electrotechnical products in 1892 this first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum  in 1895 after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas with antons arrival the family business began to expand rapidly resulting in the founding of philips metaalgloeilampfabriek nv philips metal filament lamp factory ltd in eindhoven in 1908 followed in 1912 by the foundation of philips gloeilampenfabrieken nv philips lightbulb factories ltd after gerard and anton philips changed their family business by founding the philips corporation they laid the foundations for the later electronics multinational in the 1920s the company started to manufacture other products such as vacuum tubes in 1939 they introduced their electric razor the philishave marketed in the usa using the norelco brand name the chapel is a radio with builtin loudspeaker which was designed during the early 1930s on 11 march 1927 philips went on the air with shortwave radio station pcjj later pcj which was joined in 1929 by sister station phohi philips omroep hollandindi phohi broadcast in dutch to the dutch east indies now indonesia while pcjj broadcast in english spanish and german to the rest of the world the international program on sundays commenced in 1928 with host eddie startz hosting the happy station show which became the worlds longestrunning shortwave program broadcasts from the netherlands were interrupted by the german invasion in may 1940 the germans commandeered the transmitters in huizen to use for pronazi broadcasts some originating from germany others concerts from dutch broadcasters under german control philips radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1947 and renamed radio netherlands worldwide the dutch international service some pcj programs such as happy station continued on the new station philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early 1930s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil cheap and available everywhere was favoured  they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements  encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced 16w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of 30 mm  25 mm  various development models were produced in a programme which continued throughout world war ii by the late 1940s the type 10 was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be productionised and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at 180200w electrical output from a bore and stroke of 55 mm x 27 mm was designated mp1002ca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951 but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides which the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced  in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies  on 9 may 1940 the philips directors learned that the german invasion of the netherlands was to take place the following day having prepared for this anton philips and his son in law frans otten as well as other philips family members fled to the united states taking a large amount of the company capital with them operating from the us as the north american philips company they managed to run the company throughout the war at the same time the company was moved on paper to the netherlands antilles to keep it out of american hands frits philips the son of anton was the only philips family member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of 382 jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips  in 1943 he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production for his actions in saving the hundreds of jews he was recognized by yad vashem in 1995 as a righteous among the nations  after the war the company was moved back to the netherlands with their headquarters in eindhoven many secret research facilities had been locked and successfully hidden from the invaders which allowed the company to get up to speed again quickly after the war  in 1949 the company began selling television sets  in 1950 it formed philips records philips introduced the audio compact audio cassette tape in 1963 and it was wildly successful compact cassettes were initially used for dictation machines for office typing stenographers and professional journalists as their sound quality improved cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside vinyl records used to sell recorded music philips introduced the first combination portable radio and cassette recorder which was marketed as the radiorecorder and is now better known as the boom box later the cassette was used in telephone answering machines including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop the ccassette was used as the first mass storage device for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s philips reduced the cassette size for the professional needs with the minicassette although it would not be as successful as the olympus microcassette this became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machines  in 1972 philips launched the worlds first home video cassette recorder in the uk the n1500 its relatively bulky video cassettes could record 30 minutes or 45 minutes later onehour tapes were also offered as competition came from sonys betamax and the vhs group of manufacturers philips introduced the n1700 system which allowed doublelength recording for the first time a 2hour movie could fit onto one video cassette in 1977 the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the uk featuring comedian denis norden  the concept was quickly copied by the japanese makers whose tapes were significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video 2000 system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time as philips only sold its systems on the pal standard and in europe and the japanese makers sold globally the scale advantages of the japanese proved insurmountable and philips withdrew the v2000 system and joined the vhs coalition  philips had developed a laserdisc early on for selling movies but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales later philips joined with mca to launch the first commercial laserdisc standard and players in 1982 philips teamed with sony to launch the compact disc this format evolved into the cdr cdrw dvd and later bluray which philips launched with sony in 1997  and 2006 respectively in 1984 philips split off its activities on the field of photolithographic integrated circuit production equipment the socalled wafer steppers into a joint venture with asm international located in veldhoven under the name asml over the years this new company has evolved into the worlds leading manufacturer of chip production machines at the expense of competitors like nikon and canon in 1991 the companys name was changed from nv philips gloeilampenfabrieken to philips electronics nv at the same time north american philips was formally dissolved and a new corporate division was formed in the us with the name philips electronics north america corp  in 1997 the company officers decided to move the headquarters from eindhoven to amsterdam along with the corporate name change to koninklijke philips electronics nv  the move was completed in 2001 initially the company was housed in the rembrandt tower but in 2002 they moved again this time to the breitner tower philips lighting philips research philips semiconductors spun off as nxp in september 2006 and philips design are still based in eindhoven philips healthcare is headquartered in both best netherlands near eindhoven and andover massachusetts united states near boston in 2000 philips bought optiva corporation the maker of sonicare electric toothbrushes the company was renamed philips oral healthcare and made a subsidiary of philips dap in 2004 philips abandoned the slogan lets make things better in favour of a new one sense and simplicity in december 2005 philips announced its intention to sell or demerge its semiconductor division on 1 september 2006 it was announced in berlin that the name of the new company formed by the division would be nxp semiconductors on 2 august 2006 philips completed an agreement to sell a controlling 801 stake in nxp semiconductors to a consortium of private equity investors consisting of kohlberg kravis roberts  co kkr silver lake partners and alpinvest partners on 21 august 2006 bain capital and apax partners announced that they had signed definitive commitments to join the acquiring consortium a process which was completed on 1 october 2006 in 2006 philips bought out the company lifeline systems headquartered in framingham massachusetts in august 2007 philips acquired the company ximis inc headquartered in el paso texas for their medical informatics division  in october 2007 it purchased a moore microprocessor patent mpp portfolio license from the tpl group on 21 december 2007 philips and respironics inc announced a definitive agreement pursuant to which philips acquired all of the outstanding shares of respironics for us66 per share or a total purchase price of approximately 36billion us51billion in cash  on 21 february 2008 philips completed the acquisition of visicu baltimore maryland through the merger of its indirect wholly owned subsidiary into visicu as a result of that merger visicu has become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of philips visicu was the creator of the eicu concept of the use of telemedicine from a centralized facility to monitor and care for icu patients  the philips physics laboratory was scaled down in the early 21st century as the company ceased trying to be innovative in consumer electronics through fundamental research  in january 2011 philips agreed to acquire the assets of preethi a leading indiabased kitchen appliances company because net profit slumped 85 percent in q3 2011 philips announced a cut of 4500 jobs to match part of an 800 million 11 billion costcutting scheme to boost profits and meet its financial target  in march 2012 philips announced its intention to sell or demerge its television manufacturing operations to tpv technology  in 2011 the company posted a loss of 13 billion but earned a net profit in q1 and q2 2012 however the management wanted 11 billion costcutting which was an increase from 800 million and may cut another 2200 jobs until end of 2014  on 5 december 2012 the antitrust regulators of the european union fined philips and several other major companies for fixing prices of tv cathoderay tubes in two cartels lasting nearly a decade  on 29 january 2013 it was announced that philips had agreed to sell its audio and video operations to the japanbased funai electric for 150 million with the audio business planned to transfer to funai in the latter half of 2013 and the video business in 2017   as part of the transaction funai was to pay a regular licensing fee to philips for the use of the philips brand  the purchase agreement was terminated by philips in october because of breach of contract  in april 2013 philips announced a collaboration with paradox engineering for the realization and implementation of a pilot project on networkconnected streetlighting management solutions this project was endorsed by the san francisco public utilities commission sfpuc  in 2013 philips omitted the word electronics from its name which is now royal philips nv  on 13 november 2013 philips unveiled its new brand line innovation and you and a new design of its shield mark the new brand positioning is cited by philips to signify companys evolution and emphasize that innovation is only meaningful if it is based on an understanding of peoples needs and desires  on 28 april 2014 philips agreed to sell their woox innovations subsidiary consumer electronics to gibson brands for us135 million on 23 september 2014 philips announced a plan to split the company into two separating the lighting business from the healthcare and consumer lifestyle divisions  it moved to complete this in march 2015 to an investment group for 33 billion  in february 2015 philips acquired volcano corporation to strengthen its position in noninvasive surgery and imaging  past and present ceos companies acquired by philips through the years include amperex magnavox signetics mullard vlsi agilent healthcare solutions group marconi medical systems adac laboratories atl ultrasound portions of westinghouse and the consumer electronics operations of philco and sylvania philips abandoned the sylvania trademark which is now owned by havells sylvania except in australia canada mexico new

V a murphy drip is a rectal infusion apparatus to administer the medical procedure of proctoclysis also known as rectoclysis   during the procedure an end of the murphy drip is inserted into the rectum and large quantities of liquid are infused into the rectum drop by drop  prior to fluids or medicines being given intravenously the murphy drip and hypodermoclysis were the prime routes to administer fluids such as for replacement when patients could not be fed by mouth  wisconsin surgeon john benjamin murphy introduced the drip method of saline infusion per rectum in the treatment of peritonitis  the murphy drip was invented by wisconsin surgeon john benjamin murphy for the purpose of administering a proctoclysis for hydration and replenishment of electrolytes via a sodium and calcium chloride solution this would be used when administration by mouth was not possible because of the condition of the patient  the murphy drip was described in the april 1909 issue of the journal of the american medical association  by as early as july 1928 the murphy drip was considered an auxiliary method of injection behind intravenous therapy and subcutaneous injection the two principal methods of injection at that time  the murphy drip can be used for administering drugs by this route and the apparatus is also used in conjunction with a catheter for bladder irrigation the term can even be applied to apparatus used to administer fluids intravenously  a curious anecdote involving the murphy drip is related by walter lord in his book on the battle of midway on 4 june 1942 pharmacists mate edwin miller was stationed on sand island part of the midway atoll and was making ready for the expected japanese attack miller prepared undrinkably strong coffee which he claimed was to be used in an old fashioned treatment for shock  administration of strong coffee through the rectum via a murphy drip when the attack got underway miller was joined by his commanding officer and doctor in charge lieutenant commander a e ady who did not appear to know the medical purpose of the coffee and asked for some to be poured miller thought that it would be amusing to let his commander drink it but made the mistake of also drinking some himself dr ady continued to tell jokes throughout the attack miller however paid for his practical joke and was sick  a description of a murphy drip set up is contained in the 1932 kansas supreme court legal case ratliffe v wesley hospital and nurses training school  on february 14 1929 dr horn directed the nurse to use the proctoclysis known as the murphy drip while the operation was in progress a student nurse in the employ of the hospital prepared the room for the return of the appellant the proctoclysis set was a part of the equipment of the hospital and was assembled and placed at or near the foot of the bed by the student nurse the proctoclysis set consists of a standard which is an iron pole setting on a tripod containing hooks at intervals and on these hooks by means of a chain tape string or piece of gauze is hung a can containing hot water and soda solution from this can a tube extends which is inserted in the rectum of the patient to whom the proctoclysis is administered it was necessary to keep the solution hot in order that it would have a body temperature after dropping through the tube and entering the body  it was not unusual for the vessel holding the water to be fastened to the standard by gauze string or other bandage although a part of the vessels were equipped with chains

V a syringe is a simple pump consisting of a plunger that fits tightly in a tube the plunger can be pulled and pushed along inside a cylindrical tube called a barrel allowing the syringe to take in and expel a liquid or gas through an orifice at the open end of the tube the open end of the syringe may be fitted with a hypodermic needle a nozzle or tubing to help direct the flow into and out of the barrel syringes are often used to administer injections insert intravenous drugs into the bloodstream apply compounds such as glue or lubricant and measure liquids the word syringe is derived from the greek \u03c3\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03be syrinx meaning tube via backformation of a new singular from its greektype plural syringes \u03c3\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2   sectors in the syringe and needle market include disposable and safety syringes injection pens needleless injectors insulin pumps and specialty needles  hypodermic syringes are used with hypodermic needles to inject liquid or gases into body tissues or to remove from the body injecting of air into a blood vessel is hazardous as it may cause an air embolism preventing embolisms by removing air from the syringe is one of the reasons for the familiar image of holding a hypodermic syringe pointing upward tapping it and expelling a small amount of liquid before an injection into the bloodstream the barrel of a syringe is made of plastic or glass usually has graduated marks indicating the volume of fluid in the syringe and is nearly always transparent glass syringes may be sterilized in an autoclave however most modern medical syringes are plastic with a rubber piston because this type seals much better between the piston and the barrel and because they are cheap enough to dispose of after being used only once reducing the risk of spreading bloodborne diseases reuse of needles and syringes has caused spread of diseases especially hiv and hepatitis among intravenous drug users syringes are however commonly reused by diabetics and this is safe if the syringe is only used by one person  in medical settings singleuse needles and syringes effectively reduce the risk of crosscontamination  medical syringes are sometimes used without a needle for orally administering liquid medicines to young children or animals or milk to small young animals because the dose can be measured accurately and it is easier to squirt the medicine into the subjects mouth instead of coaxing the subject to drink out of a measuring spoon syringes come with a number of designs for the area in which the blade locks to the syringe body perhaps the most well known of these is the luer lock which simply twists the two together bodies featuring a small plain connection are known as slip tips and are useful for when the syringe is being connected to something not featuring a screw lock mechanism similar to this is the catheter tip which is essentially a slip tip but longer and tapered making it good for pushing into things where there the plastic taper can form a tight seal these can also be used for rinsing out wounds or large abscesses in veterinary use there is also an eccentric tip where the nozzle at the end of the syringe is not in the centre of the syringe but at the side this causes the blade attached to the syringe to lie almost in line with the walls of the syringe itself and they are used when the blade needs to get very close to parallel with the skin when injecting into a surface vein or artery for example syringes for insulin users are designed for standard u100 insulin the dilution of insulin is such that 1 ml of insulin fluid has 100 standard units of insulin  since insulin vials are typically 10 ml each vial has 1000 units insulin syringes are made specifically for self injections and have friendly features u100 syringe sizes and markings there are needle syringes designed to reload from a builtin tank container after each injection so they can make several or many injections on a filling these are not used much in human medicine because of the risk of crossinfection via the needle an exception is the personal insulin autoinjector used by diabetic patients venom extraction syringes are different from standard syringes because they usually dont puncture the wound the most common types have a plastic nozzle which is placed over the affected area and then the syringe piston is pulled back creating a vacuum that allegedly sucks out the venom attempts to treat snakebites in this way are specifically advised against as they are ineffective and can cause additional injury  syringes of this type are sometimes used for extracting human botfly larvae from the skin  an oral syringe is a measuring instrument used to accurately measure doses of liquid medicine which are expressed in millilitres ml they do not have threaded tips because no needle or other device needs to be screwed onto them the contents are simply squirted or sucked from the syringe directly into the mouth of the person or animal oral syringes are available in various sizes from 110 ml and larger the sizes most commonly used are 1 ml 25 ml and 5 ml  a dental syringe is a used by dentists for the injection of an anesthetic it consists of a breechloading syringe fitted with a sealed cartridge containing anesthetic solution the ancillary tool generally part of a dental engine used to supply water compressed air or mist formed by combination of water and compressed air to the oral cavity for the purpose of irrigation cleaning debris away from the area the dentist is working on is also referred to as a dental syringe or a dental irrigation nozzle a 3way syringe  nozzle has separate internal channels supplying air water or a mist created by combining the pressurized air with the waterflow the syringe tip can be separated from the main body and replaced when necessary in some jurisdictions the sale or possession of hypodermic syringes may be controlled or prohibited without a prescription  due to its potential use with illegal intravenous drugs  the syringe has many nonmedical applications medicalgrade disposable hypodermic syringes are often used in research laboratories for convenience and low cost another application is to use the needle tip to add liquids to very confined spaces such as washing out some scientific apparatus they are often used for measuring and transferring solvents and reagents where a high precision is not required alternatively microliter syringes can be used to measure and dose chemicals very precisely by using a small diameter capillary as the syringe barrel the polyethylene construction of these disposable syringes usually makes them rather chemically resistant there is however a risk of the contents of the syringes leaching plasticizers from the syringe material nondisposable glass syringes may be preferred where this is a problem glass syringes may also be preferred where a very high degree of precision is important ie quantitative chemical analysis because their engineering tolerances are lower and the plungers move more smoothly in these applications the transfer of pathogens is usually not an issue used with a long needle or cannula syringes are also useful for transferring fluids through rubber septa when atmospheric oxygen or moisture are being excluded examples include the transfer of airsensitive or pyrophoric reagents such as phenylmagnesium bromide and nbutyllithium respectively glass syringes are also used to inject small samples for gas chromatography 1 \u03bcl and mass spectrometry 10 \u03bcl syringe drivers may be used with the syringe as well some culinary uses of syringes are injecting liquids such as gravy into other foods or for the manufacture of some candies  syringes may also be used when cooking meat to enhance flavor and texture by injecting juices inside the meat and in baking to inject filling inside a pastry syringes are used to refill ink cartridges with ink in fountain pens common workshop applications include injecting glue into tight spots to repair joints where disassembly is impractical or impossible and injecting lubricants onto working surfaces without spilling sometimes a large hypodermic syringe is used without a needle for very small baby mammals to suckle from in artificial rearing historically large pumps that use reciprocating motion to pump water were referred to as syringes pumps of this type were used as early firefighting equipment there are fountain syringes where the liquid is in a bag or can and goes to the nozzle via a pipe in earlier times clyster syringes were used for that purpose loose snus is often applied using modified syringes  the nozzle is removed so the opening is the width of the chamber the snus can be packed tightly into the chamber and plunged into the upper lip syringes called portioners are also manufactured for this particular purpose

V the kendrick extrication device ked is a device that is used in vehicle extrication to remove victims of traffic collisions from motor vehicles commonly carried on ambulances the ked is typically applied by an emergency medical technician paramedic or another first responder typically used in conjunction with a cervical collar the ked is a semirigid brace that secures the head neck and torso in an anatomically neutral position this position reduces the possibility of additional injuries to these regions during extrication the original ked was designed by richard kendrick in 1978    typically there are two head straps three torso straps and two legs straps which are used to adequately secure the ked to the victim unlike a long spine board or litter the ked uses a series of wooden or polymer bars in a nylon jacket allowing the responders to immobilize the neck and upper spine and remove the victim from the vehicle or other confined space although the ked can also be used to immobilize infants and children it is preferable to use specifically designed pediatric immobilization devices whenever possible if the ked is used to immobilize an infant or child appropriate padding must be used to ensure complete immobilization in a manner that does not obscure the thorax and abdomen thereby preventing continued assessment of these vital areas the device can be quickly and easily inserted into the seat of a vehicle by a single rescuer allows access to the airway and conforms to any body size  the ked is typically used only on hemodynamically stable victims unstable victims are extricated using rapid extrication techniques without the prior application of the ked once the ked is slid into position it is secured to the victim with straps in order to prevent movement the first strap that is secured is the middle torso strap according to the ked users manual securing this strap secures the greatest area of the device and therefore provides the greatest stability while securing the rest of the device next the bottom torso strap is secured however the top torso strap is not secured until just prior to moving the patient to the long spine board this is to allow the patient to breathe easily while the rest of the device is secured following the bottom torso strap the leg straps are secured these may be applied in a crisscross fashion according to the ked users manual this is the most commonly used method or applied by securing them to their respective sides if there is any evidence of a groin injury the crisscross method cannot be used following application of the leg straps the void between the head and device is padded as needed and the head is secured finally just prior to moving the patient to a long spine board the top strap is secured  some schools teach this order by remembering the phrase my baby looks hot tonight or money buys lots of hot toys where the beginning of each word stands for middle torso strap bottom torso strap leg straps head strap and top torso strap the head pad can bring the head too far forward for the side panels to fully immobilize it care must be taken to secure the head properly to maintain neutral immobilization if the head is too far forward the head is brought back to meet the ked unless crepitus pain or resistance is met if these symptoms are present the head is immobilized in the position found it is worth noting that there is debate and controversy surrounding the exact order of applying the torso straps with some saying that the order does not matter as long as the torso is secured before the head the ked users manual is sometimes used in this justification with the explanation that it states the reason the top strap is last is a function of breathing and not the process of immobilization itself  furthermore they will reference the concept that the critical factor in any immobilization process is that the head is immobilized last and the order of immobilization prior to that process does not make a difference in terms of the immobilization itself this view is somewhat supported and likely promulgated by ems certification organizations such as the national registry of emts in the united states in their assessment of seated spinal immobilization not written for any one specific deviceit is stated that the torso must be immobilized before the head moreover one of the critical criteria that can result in failure of the assessment is if the head is immobilized before the torso is sufficiently secured  the use of sufficiently is of course subjective but a strict interpretation of this may lead one to infer that all the torso straps must be secured before the head an exhaustive search of the literature for peer reviewed scientific data regarding the positive or negative effects of application of the ked straps in any specific order found no results it is likely such data does not exist and that there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue however best practices indicate that the manufacturers directions should be followed whenever using any piece of medical equipment that being said whenever the ems professional is in doubt about a medical procedure it is advisable to contact your local medical director during rapid extrication the patient is not immobilized by a ked but rather taken directly out of the car onto a back board reasons for

V a topical medication is a medication that is applied to a particular place on or in the body as opposed to systemically the word topical derives from greek topikos of a place most often this means application to body surfaces such as the skin or mucous membranes to treat ailments via a large range of classes including but not limited to creams foams gels lotions and ointments  many topical medications are epicutaneous meaning that they are applied directly to the skin topical medications may also be inhalational such as asthma medications or applied to the surface of tissues other than the skin such as eye drops applied to the conjunctiva or ear drops placed in the ear or medications applied to the surface of a tooth as a route of administration topical medications are contrasted with enteral in the digestive tract and intravascularintravenous injected into the circulatory system a topical effect in the pharmacodynamic sense may refer to a local rather than systemic target for a medication however many topically administered drugs have systemic effects because they reach the circulation after being absorbed by the tissues topical medications differ from many other types of drugs because mishandling them can lead to certain complications in a patient or administrator of the drug  some hydrophobic chemicals such as steroid hormones can be absorbed into the body after being applied to the skin in the form of a cream gel or lotion transdermal patches have become a popular means of administering some drugs for birth control hormone replacement therapy and prevention of motion sickness one example of an antibiotic that may be applied topically is chloramphenicol   a medications potency often is changed with its base for example some topical steroids will be classified one or two strengths higher when moving from cream to ointment as a rule of thumb an ointment base is more occlusive and will drive the medication into the skin more rapidly than a solution or cream base  the manufacturer of each topical product has total control over the content of the base of a medication although containing the same active ingredients one manufacturers cream might be more acidic than the next which could cause skin irritation or change its absorption rate for example a vaginal formulation of miconazole antifungal cream might irritate the skin less than an athlete foot formulation of miconazole cream these variations can on occasion result in different clinical outcomes even though the active ingredient is the same no comparative potency labeling exists to ensure equal efficacy between brands of topical steroids percentage of oil vs water dramatically affect the potency of topical steroid studies have confirmed that the potency of some topical steroid products may differ according to manufacturer or brand an example of this is the case of brand name valisone cream and kenalog cream in clinical studies have demonstrated significantly better vasoconstrictions than some forms of this drug produced by generic drug manufacturers  however in a simple base like an ointment much less variation between manufacturers is common in dermatology the base of a topical medication is often as important as the medication itself it is extremely important to receive a medication in the correct base before applying to the skin a pharmacist should not substitute an ointment for a cream or vice versa as the potency of the medication can change some physicians use a thick ointment to replace the waterproof barrier of the inflamed skin in the treatment of eczema and a cream might not accomplish the same clinical intention there are many general classes with no clear dividing line between similar formulations as a result what the manufacturers marketing department chooses to list on the label of a topical medication might be completely different from what the form would normally be called for example eucerin cream is more appropriately described as an ointment than as a cream topical solutions are of low viscosity and often use water or alcohol in the base the solution can cause drying of the skin if alcohol is used in the base  these are usually a powder dissolved in water alcohol and sometimes oil alcohol in topical steroids can frequently cause drying if it is used as a base ingredient there is significant variability between brands there is a risk of irritation depending on the preservatives and fragrances used in the base some examples of topical solutions are given below lotions are similar to solutions but are thicker and tend to be more emollient in nature than solution they are usually an oil mixed with water and more often than not have less alcohol than solutions lotions can be drying if they contain a high amount of alcohol there is a significant variability in the ingredients between different lotions a mixture that separates into two or three parts with time frequently an oil mixed with a waterbased solution needs to be shaken into suspension before use shake well before use a cream is an emulsion of oil and water in approximately equal proportions it penetrates the stratum corneum outer layer of skin wall cream is thicker than lotion and maintains its shape when removed from its container it tends to be moderate in moisturizing tendency for topical steroid products oilinwater emulsions are common creams have a significant risk of causing immunological sensitization due to preservatives it has a high rate of acceptance by patients there is a great variation in ingredients composition ph and tolerance among generic brands  an ointment is a homogeneous viscous semisolid preparation most commonly a greasy thick oil oil 80  water 20 with a high viscosity that is intended for external application to the skin or mucous membranes ointments have a water number that defines the maximum amount of water that it can containthey are used as emollients or for the application of active ingredients to the skin for protective therapeutic or prophylactic purposes and where a degree of occlusion is desired ointments are used topically on a variety of body surfaces these include the skin and the mucous membranes of the eye an eye ointment chest vulva anus and nose an ointment may or may not be medicated ointments are usually very moisturizing and good for dry skin they have a low risk of sensitization due to having few ingredients beyond the base oil or fat and low irritation risk there is typically little variability between brands of drugs they are often disliked by patients due to greasiness  the vehicle of an ointment is known as the ointment base the choice of a base depends upon the clinical indication for the ointment the different types of ointment bases are the medicaments are dispersed in the base and are divided after penetrating the living cells of the skin the water number of an ointment is the maximum quantity of water that 100g of a base can contain at 20c ointments are formulated using hydrophobic hydrophilic or wateremulsifying bases to provide preparations that are immiscible miscible or emulsifiable with skin secretions they can also be derived from hydrocarbon fatty absorption waterremovable or watersoluble bases properties which affect choice of an ointment base are trituration in this finely subdivided insoluble medicaments are evenly distributed by grinding with a small amount of the base followed by dilution with gradually increasing amounts of the base fusion in this method the ingredients are melted together in descending order of their melting points and stirred to ensure homogeneity gels are thicker than a solution gels are often a semisolid emulsion in an alcohol base some will melt at body temperature gel tends to be cellulose cut with alcohol or acetone gels tend to be drying gels tend to have greatly variable ingredients between brands gels carry a significant risk of inducing hypersensitivity due to fragrances and preservatives gel is useful for the scalp and body folds in applying gel one should avoid fissures and erosions due to the drying and stinging effect of the alcohol base gel enjoys a high rate of acceptance due to its cosmetic elegance  foam can be seen with topical steroid marketed for the scalp transdermal patches can be a very precise time released method of delivering a drug cutting a patch in half might affect the dose delivered the release of the active component from a transdermal delivery system patch may be controlled by diffusion through the adhesive which covers the whole patch by diffusion through a membrane which may only have adhesive on the patch rim or drug release may be controlled by release from a polymer matrix cutting a patch might cause rapid dehydration of the base of the medicine and affect the rate of diffusion a topical dosage form that is programmed with low frequencies recognized by the body and complements topical medication adhered to the backing of the chip powder  is either the pure drug by itself talcum powder or is made of the drug mixed in a carrier such as corn starch or corn cob powder zeosorb af  miconazole powder can be used as an inhaled topical cocaine powder used in nasal surgery medication may be placed in a solid form examples are deodorant antiperspirants astringents and hemostatic agents some solids melt when they reach body temperature eg rectal suppositories certain contraceptive methods rely on sponge as a carrier of a liquid medicine lemon juice embedded in a sponge has been used as a primitive contraception in some cultures cordran tape is an example of a topical steroid applied under occlusion by tape this greatly increases the potency and absorption of the topical steroid and is used to treat inflammatory skin diseases some medications are applied as an ointment or gel and reach the mucous membrane via vaporization examples are nasal topical decongestants and smelling salt paste combines three agents  oil water and powder it is an ointment in which a powder is suspended a tincture is a skin preparation that has a high percentage of alcohol it would normally be used as a drug vehicle if drying of the area is desired

V mouthwash mouth rinse oral rinse or mouth bath  is a liquid which is held in the mouth passively or swilled around the mouth by contraction of the perioral muscles andor movement of the head and may be gargled where the head is tilted back and the liquid bubbled at the back of the mouth usually mouthwashes are an antiseptic solution intended to reduce the microbial load in the oral cavity although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their analgesic antiinflammatory or antifungal action additionally some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in xerostomia dry mouth   cosmetic mouthrinses temporarily control or reduce bad breath and leave the mouth with a pleasant taste    common use involves rinsing the mouth with about 20ml 23 fl oz of mouthwash the wash is typically swished or gargled for about half a minute and then spit out most companies suggest not drinking water immediately after using mouthwash in some brands the expectorate is stained so that one can see the bacteria and debris   mouthwash should not be used immediately after brushing the teeth so as not to wash away the beneficial fluoride residue left from the toothpaste similarly the mouth should not be rinsed out with water after brushing patients were told to spit dont rinse after toothbrushing as part of an national health service campaign in the uk  gargling is where the head is tilted back allowing the mouthwash to sit in the back of the mouth while exhaling causing the liquid to bubble gargling is practiced in japan for perceived prevention of viral infection one commonly used way is with infusions or tea in some cultures gargling is usually done in private typically in a bathroom at a sink so the liquid can be rinsed away  the most common use of mouthwash is commercial antiseptics which are used at home as part of an oral hygiene routine some manufacturers of mouthwash state that antiseptic and antiplaque mouth rinse kill the bacterial plaque that causes cavities gingivitis and bad breath anticavity mouth rinse uses fluoride to protect against tooth decay it is however generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both brushing and flossing    the american dental association asserts that regular brushing and proper flossing are enough in most cases although they approve many mouthwashes that do not contain ethanol in addition to regular dental checkups  for many patients however the mechanical methods could be tedious and timeconsuming and additionally some local conditions may render them especially difficult chemotherapeutic agents including mouthrinses could have a key role as adjuncts to daily home care preventing and controlling supragingival plaque gingivitis and oral malodor  another common use of mouthwash is prior to and after oral surgery procedures such as tooth extraction minor and transient side effects of commercial mouthwashes are very common such as taste disturbance tooth staining sensation of a dry mouth etc alcoholcontaining mouthwashes may make dry mouth and halitosis worse since it dries out the mouth   soreness ulceration and redness may sometimes occur eg aphthous stomatitis allergic contact stomatitis if the person is allergic or sensitive to mouthwash ingredients such as preservatives coloring flavors and fragrances such effects might be reduced or eliminated by diluting the mouthwash with water using a different mouthwash eg salt water or foregoing mouthwash entirely each commercial brand of mouthwash has different ingredients the active ingredients are usually to prevent bleeding etc mouthwashes with ingredients such as tranexamic acid are locally applied phenolic compounds include essential oil constituents that have some antibacterial properties   like phenol  thymol  eugenol  eucalyptol  or menthol  astringents like zinc chloride to provide a pleasanttasting sensation and shrink tissues  or alternative mouthwash ingredients might include persica or alum  alcohol is added to mouthwash not to destroy bacteria but to act as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients such as menthol eucalyptol and thymol which help to penetrate plaque  commercial mouthwashes usually contain a preservative such as sodium benzoate or methylparaben to preserve freshness once the container has been opened many newer brands are alcoholfree and contain odorelimination agents such as oxidizers as well as odorpreventing agents such as zinc ion to keep future bad breath from developing  flavoring agents include sweeteners such as sorbitol sucralose sodium saccharin and xylitol which doubles as a bacterial inhibitor  custom formulations of mouthwash are nonstandardized mixtures of ingredients prescribed for a specific purpose such as for use prior to oral surgery or to treat the pain associated with mucositis caused by radiation therapy or chemotherapy it is also prescribed for aphthous ulcers other oral ulcers and other mouth pain  variations are common and some are done with overthecounter products magic mouthwashes are intended to combine ingredients to treat a variety of oral conditions magic mouthwashes are typically compounded in a pharmacy from a doctors prescription   common ingredients include diphenhydramine antihistamine glucocorticoids antiinflammatory lidocainexylocaine local anesthetic  maalox antacid nystatin antifungal for oral candidiasis sucralfate coating agent tetracycline or erythromycin antibiotics  despite a lack of evidence that magic mouthwashes are effective in decreasing the pain of oral lesions many patients and prescribers continue to use them there has been only one controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of magic mouthwash it shows no difference in efficacy among the most common formulation and other agents such as chlorhexidine and a salinebaking soda solution current guidelines suggest that saline solution is just as effective as magic mouthwash in pain relief or shortening of healing time of oral mucositis from cancer therapies  because magic mouthwash has no standard formulation its use involves concerns about patient safety it is important that the prescriber and pharmacist are in specific agreement about exactly what is being prescribed so as to minimize the potential for drug interaction and the possibility of drug allergy sometimes a significant amount of alcohol up to 27 vol is added  as a carrier for the flavor to provide bite  because of the alcohol content it is possible to fail a breathalyzer test after rinsing although breath alcohol levels return to normal after 10 minutes  in addition alcohol is a drying agent which encourages bacterial activity in the mouth releasing more malodorous volatile sulfur compounds therefore alcoholcontaining mouthwash may temporarily worsen halitosis in those who already have it or indeed be the sole cause of halitosis in other individuals  it is hypothesized that alcohol mouthwashes acts as a carcinogen cancerinducing generally there is no scientific consensus about this    one review stated there is now sufficient evidence to accept the proposition that developing oral cancer is increased or contributed to by the use of alcoholcontaining mouthwashes whilst many of these products may have been shown to be effective in penetrating oral microbial biofilms in vitro and reducing oral bacterial load it would be wise to restrict their use to shortterm therapeutic situations if needed perhaps the use of mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol may be equally effective further mouthrinses should be prescribed by dentists like any other medication there may well be a reason for the use of alcoholcontaining mouthrinses but only for a particular situation and for a limited and controlled period of time as such patients should be provided with written instructions for mouthwash use and mouthwash use should be restricted to adults for short durations and specific clearly defined reasons it is the opinion of the authors that in light of the evidence currently available of the association of alcoholcontaining mouthwashes with the development of oral cancer it would be inadvisable for oral healthcare professionals to recommend the longterm use of alcoholcontaining mouthwashes  the same researchers also state that the risk of acquiring oral cancer rises almost five times for users of alcoholcontaining mouthwash who neither smoke nor drink with a higher rate of increase for those who do  in addition the authors highlight side effects from several mainstream mouthwashes that included dental erosion and accidental poisoning  of children the review garnered media attention  and conflicting opinions from other researchers yinka ebo of cancer research uk disputed the findings concluding that there is still not enough evidence to suggest that using mouthwash that contains alcohol will increase the risk of mouth cancer  studies conducted in 1985  1995  2003  and 2012  did not support an association between alcoholcontaining mouth rinses and oral cancer andrew penman chief executive of the cancer council new south wales called for further research on the matter  in a march 2009 brief the american dental association said the available evidence does not support a connection between oral cancer and alcoholcontaining mouthrinse  many newer brands of mouthwash are alcohol free not just in response to consumer concerns about oral cancer but also to cater for religious groups who abstain from alcohol consumption chlorhexidine digluconate is a chemical antiseptic and is used in a 01202 solution as a mouthwash it has significant antiplaque action but also some antifungal action  it is especially effective against gramnegative rods  it is sometimes used as an adjunct to prevent dental caries and to treat periodontal disease  although it does not penetrate into periodontal pockets well  chlorhexidine mouthwash alone is unable to prevent plaque so it is not a substitute for regular toothbrushing and flossing  in the short term if toothbrushing is impossible due to pain as may occur in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis chlorhexidine is used as temporary substitute for other oral hygiene measures  it is not suited for use in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis however  rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash before a tooth extraction reduces the risk of dry socket a painful condition where the blood clot is lost from an extraction socket and bone is exposed to the oral cavity  other uses of chlorhexidine mouthwash include prevention of oral candidiasis in immunocompromised persons  treatment of denturerelated stomatitis and many other uses  chlorhexidine has good substantivity the ability of a mouthwash to bind to hard and soft tissues in the mouth  however chlorhexidine binds to tannins meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining ie removable staining of teeth  chlorhexidine is rarely associated with other issues like overgrowth of enterobacteria in persons with leukemia desquamation and irritation of oral mucosa salivary gland pain and swelling and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  essential oils are oils which have been extracted from plants mouthwashes based on essential oils could be more effective than traditional mouthcare  for antigingival treatments     they have been found effective in reducing halitosis and are being used in several commercial mouthwashes phenolic mouthwashes eg methylsalicylate in listerine have some antiplaque action but less substantivity than chlorhexidine  they do not stain teeth  most people using fluoridated toothpastes do not require fluoridecontaining mouth rinses rather fluoride mouthwashes are sometimes used in individuals who are at high risk of dental decay due to dental caries or people with xerostomia   xylitol stimulates salivary function due to its sweetness and taste and helps restore the mouth to a neutral level of acidity  xylitol rinses aid in cavity prevention and have been used as substitute for alcohol to avoid dryness of mouth associated with alcohol  sodium lauryl sulfate sls is notorious for causing aphthous stomatitis mouth ulcers in susceptible individuals it is present  as a foaming agent  in a great many oral hygiene products including many mouthwashes some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains sls since the anionic compounds in the sls toothpaste can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthrinse  however many of the popular mouthwashes also contain sls as an ingredient eg listerine total care triclosan is a nonionic chlorinate bisphenol antiseptic when used in mouthwash eg 003 there is moderate substantivity broad spectrum antibacterial action some antifungal action and significant antiplaque effect especially when combined with copolymer or zinc citrate  triclosan does not cause staining of the teeth  the safety of triclosan has been questioned  in painful oral conditions such as aphthous stomatitis analgesic mouthrinses eg benzydamine mouthwash or difflam are sometimes used to ease pain commonly used before meals to reduce discomfort while eating betamethasone is sometimes used as an antiinflammatory corticosteroid mouthwash it may be used for severe inflammatory conditions of the oral mucosa such as the severe forms of aphthous stomatitis   cetylpyridinium chloride containing mouthwash eg 005 is used in some specialized mouthwashes for halitosis  cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash has less antiplaque effect than chlorhexidine and may cause staining of teeth or sometimes an oral burning sensation or ulceration  in traditional ayurvedic medicine the use of oil mouthwashes is called kavala oil swishing or gandusha   and this practice has more recently been remarketed by the complimentary and alternative medicine industry as oil pulling  its promoters claim it works by pulling out toxins which are known as ama in ayurvedic medicine and thereby reducing inflammation  ayurvedic literature suggests oil pulling is capable of improving oral and systemic health including a benefit in conditions such as headaches migraines diabetes mellitus asthma  and acne as well as whitening teeth  oil pulling has received little study and there is little evidence to support claims made by the techniques advocates  when compared with chlorhexidine in one small study it was found to be less effective at reducing oral bacterial load   otherwise the health claims of oil pulling have failed scientific verification  or have not been investigated  there is a report of lipid pneumonia caused by accidental inhalation of the oil during oil pulling    the mouth is rinsed with approximately one tablespoon of oil for 1020 minutes then spat out   sesame oil coconut oil and ghee are traditionally used  but newer oils such as sunflower oil are also used  hydrogen peroxide can be used as an oxidizing mouthwash eg peroxyl 15  it kills anearobic bacteria and also has a mechanical cleansing action when it froths as it comes into contact with debris in mouth  it is often used in the short term to treat acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis  side effects with prolonged use might occur including hypertrophy of the lingual papillae  lactoperoxidase has been used in mouthrinses eg biotene to reduce oral bacteria and hence the acid produced by bacteria  a 2005 study found that gargling three times a day with simple water or with a povidoneiodine solution although with less effectiveness was effective in preventing upper respiratory infection and decreasing the severity of symptoms if contracted  a later study found that the same procedure did not prevent influenzalike illnesses  other sources attribute the benefit to a simple placebo effect  sanguinarinecontaining mouthwashes are marketed as antiplaque and antimalodor  it is a toxic alkaloid herbal extract obtained from plants such as sanguinaria canadensis bloodroot argemone mexicana mexican prickly poppy and others  however its use is strongly associated with development of leukoplakia a white patch in the mouth usually in the buccal sulcus   this type of leukoplakia has been termed sanguinariaassociated keratosis and more than 80 of people with leukoplakia in the vestibule of the mouth have used this substance upon stopping contact with the causative substance the lesions may persist for years although this type of leukoplakia may show dysplasia the potential for malignant transformation is unknown  ironically elements within the complimentary and alternative medicine industry promote the use of sanguinaria as a therapy for cancer sodium bicarbonate is sometimes combined with salt to make a simple homemade mouthwash indicated for any of the reasons that a salt water mouthwash might be used premixed mouthwashes of 1 sodium bicarbonate and 15 sodium chloride in aqueous solution are marketed  although pharmacists will easily be able to produce such a formulation from the base ingredients when required sodium bicarbonate mouthwash is sometimes used to remove viscous saliva and to aid visualization of the oral tissues during examination of the mouth   hot salt water mouth baths or hot salt water mouth washes sometimes abbreviated to hswmw are also routinely used after oral surgery to keep food debris out of healing wounds and to prevent infection some oral surgeons consider salt water mouthwashes the mainstay of wound cleanliness after surgery  in dental extractions hot salt water mouthbaths should start about 24 hours after a dental extraction  the term mouth bath implies that the liquid is passively held in the mouth rather than vigorously swilled around which could dislodge a blood clot once the blood clot has stabilized the mouth wash can be used more vigorously  these mouthwashes tend to be advised about 6 times per day especially after meals to remove food from the socket  salt water mouth wash is made by dissolving 051 teaspoon of table salt into a cup of water    which is as hot as possible without causing discomfort in the mouth saline has a mechanical cleansing action and an antiseptic action as it is a hypertonic solution in relation to bacteria which undergo lysis the heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow hyperemia  to the surgical site promoting healing  hot salt water mouthwashes also encourage the draining of pus from dental abscesses  conversely if heat is applied on the side of the face eg hot water bottle rather than inside the mouth it may cause a dental abscess to drain extraorally which is later associated with an area of fibrosis on the face see cutaneous sinus of dental origin  gargling with salt water is said to reduce the symptoms of a sore throat  tetracycline is an antibiotic which may sometimes be used as a mouthwash in adults it causes red staining of teeth in children it is sometimes use for herpetiforme ulceration an uncommon type of aphthous stomatitis but prolonged use may lead to oral candidiasis as the fungal population of the mouth overgrows in the absence of enough competing bacteria   48 tranexamic acid solution is sometimes used as an antifibrinolytic mouthwash to prevent bleeding during and after oral surgery in persons with coagulopathies clotting disorders or who are taking anticoagulants blood thinners such as warfarin   the first known references to mouth rinsing is in ayurveda and chinese medicine about 2700 bc for treatment of gingivitis  later in the greek and roman periods mouth rinsing following mechanical cleansing became common among the upper classes and hippocrates recommended a mixture of salt alum and vinegar  the jewish talmud dating back about 1800 years suggests a cure for gum ailments containing dough water and olive oil  before europeans came to the americas native north american and mesoamerican cultures used mouthwashes often made from plants such as coptis trifolia  indeed aztec dentistry was more advanced than european dentistry of the age  peoples of the americas used salt water mouthwashes for sore throats and other mouthwashes for problems such as teething and mouth ulcers  anton van leeuwenhoek the famous 17th century microscopist discovered living organisms living because they were motile in deposits on the teeth what we now call dental plaque he also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in delft he experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque he concludedcorrectlythat the mouthwash either did not reach or was not present long enough to kill the plaque organisms  that remained the state of affairs until the late 1960s when harald loe at the time a professor at the royal dental college in aarhus denmark demonstrated that a chlorhexidine compound could prevent the buildup of dental plaque the reason for chlorhexidine effectiveness is that it strongly adheres to surfaces in the mouth and thus remains present in effective concentrations for many hours  since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the buildup in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis in addition to fighting bad breath many of these solutions aim to control the volatile sulfur compound vsccreating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste   for example the number of mouthwash variants in the united states of america has grown from 15 1970 to 66 1998 to 113 2012  research in the field of microbiotas shows that only a limited set of microbes cause tooth decay with most of the bacteria in the human mouth being harmless focused attention on cavitycausing bacteria such as streptococcus mutans has led research into new mouthwash treatments that prevent these bacteria from initially growing while current mouthwash treatments must be used with a degree of frequency to prevent this bacteria from regrowing future treatments could provide a viable long term solution

V an oxygen mask provides a method to transfer breathing oxygen gas from a storage tank to the lungs oxygen masks may cover the nose and mouth oral nasal mask or the entire face fullface mask they may be made of plastic silicone or rubber in certain circumstances oxygen may be delivered via a nasal cannula instead of a mask   medical plastic oxygen masks are used primarily by medical care providers for oxygen therapy because they are disposable and so reduce cleaning costs and infection risks mask design can determine accuracy of oxygen delivered with many various medical situations requiring treatment with oxygen oxygen is naturally occurring in room air at 21 and higher percentages are often essential in medical treatment oxygen in these higher percentages is classified as a drug with too much oxygen being potentially harmful to a patients health resulting in oxygen dependence over time and in extreme circumstances patient blindness for these reasons oxygen therapy is closely monitored masks are light in weight and attached using an elasticated headband or ear loops they are transparent for allowing the face to be visible for patient assessment by healthcare providers and reducing a sensation of claustrophobia experienced by some patients when wearing an oxygen mask the vast majority of patients having an operation will at some stage wear an oxygen mask they may alternatively wear a nasal cannula but oxygen delivered in this way is less accurate and restricted in concentration silicone and rubber oxygen masks are heavier than plastic masks they are designed to provide a good seal for longduration use by aviators medical research subjects and hyperbaric chamber and other patients who require administration of pure oxygen such as carbon monoxide poisoning and decompression sickness victims dr arthur h bulbulian pioneered the first modern viable oxygen mask worn by world war ii pilots and used by hospitals  valves inside these tightfitting masks control the flow of gases into and out of the masks so that rebreathing of exhaled gas is minimised hoses or tubing connect an oxygen mask to the oxygen supply hoses are larger in diameter than tubing and can allow greater oxygen flow when a hose is used it may have a ribbed or corrugated design to allow bending of the hose while preventing twisting and cutting off the oxygen flow the quantity of oxygen delivered from the storage tank to the oxygen mask is controlled by a valve called a regulator some types of oxygen masks have a breathing bag made of plastic or rubber attached to the mask or oxygen supply hose to store a supply of oxygen to allow deep breathing without waste of oxygen with use of simple fixed flow regulators three main kinds of oxygen masks are used by pilots and crews who fly at high altitudes continuous flow diluter demand and pressure demand  the first successful creation for the oxygen mask was by armenian born dr arthur bulbulian in the field of facial prosthetics in a continuousflow system oxygen is provided to the user continuously it does not matter if the user is exhaling or inhaling as oxygen is flowing from the time the system is activated below the oxygen mask is a rebreather bag that collects oxygen during exhalation and as a result allows a higher flow rate during the inhalation cycle  diluterdemand and pressuredemand masks supply oxygen only when the user inhales  they each require a good seal between the mask and the users face in a diluterdemand system as the altitude increases ambient pressure and therefore the partial pressure of ambient oxygen decreases the oxygen flow increases such that the partial pressure of oxygen is roughly constant diluterdemand oxygen systems can be used up to 40000 feet 12000m  in a pressuredemand system oxygen in the mask is above ambient pressure permitting breathing above 40000 feet 12000m  because the pressure inside the mask is greater than the pressure around the users torso inhalation is easy but exhalation requires more effort aviators are trained in pressuredemand breathing in altitude chambers because they seal tightly pressuredemandtype oxygen masks are also used in hyperbaric oxygen chambers and for oxygen breathing research projects with standard oxygen regulators  many designs of aviators oxygen masks contain a microphone to transmit speech to other crew members and to the aircrafts radio military aviators oxygen masks have face pieces that partially cover the sides of the face and protect the face against flash burns flying particles and effects of a high speed air stream hitting the face during emergency evacuation from the aircraft by ejection seat or parachute they are often part of a pressure suit or intended for use with a flight helmet an early 1919 highaltitude oxygen system used a vacuum flask of liquid oxygen to supply two people for one hour at 15000 feet 4600m the liquid passed through several warming stages before use as expansion when it evaporated and absorbed latent heat of vaporization would make the gasified oxygen so cold that it could cause instant frostbite of the lungs  most commercial aircraft are fitted with oxygen masks for use when cabin pressurization fails   in general commercial aircraft are pressurized so that the cabin air is at a pressure equivalent to no more than 8000 feet 2400m altitude usually somewhat lower altitude where one can breathe normally without an oxygen mask if the oxygen pressure in the cabin drops below a safe level risking hypoxia compartments containing the oxygen masks will open automatically either above or in front of the passenger and crew seats and in the lavatories in the early years of commercial flight before pressurized cabins were invented airliner passengers sometimes had to wear oxygen masks during routine flights firefighters and emergency service workers use full face masks that provide breathing air as well as eye and face protection  these masks are typically attached to a tank carried upon the back of the wearer and are called selfcontained breathing apparatuses scba  open circuit scbas do not normally supply oxygen as it is not necessary and constitutes a fire hazard rebreather scbas usually supply oxygen as this is the lightest and most compact option and uses a simpler mechanism than other types of rebreather specialized fullface masks that supply oxygen or other breathing gases are used by astronauts to remove nitrogen from their blood before space walks eva  specialized snout masks which supply oxygen to revive family pets have been donated to fire departments     divers only use pure oxygen for accelerated decompression or from oxygen rebreathers at shallow depths where the risk of acute oxygen toxicity is acceptable oxygen supply during inwater decompression is via rebreather open circuit diving regulator fullface mask or diving helmet which has been prepared for oxygen service  oxygen supply to divers in decompression chambers is preferably through a builtin breathing system which uses an oxygen mask plumbed into supply and exhaust hoses which supply oxygen from outside the chamber and discharge the exhaled oxygenrich gas outside the chamber using a system equivalent to two demand valves one upstream of the diver to supply oxygen on demand and the other downstream to exhaust exhaled gas on demand so that the oxygen partial pressure in the chamber is limited to relatively safe levels if oxygen masks are used that discharge into the chamber the chamber air must be replaced frequently to keep the oxygen level within safe operating limits  anesthesia masks are face masks that are designed to administer anesthetic gases to a patient through inhalation anesthesia masks are either made of antistatic silicone or rubber as a static electricity spark may ignite some anesthetic gases they are either black rubber or clear silicone anesthesia masks fit over the mouth and nose and have a double hose system one hose carries inhaled anesthetic gas to the mask and the other brings exhaled anesthetic gas back to the machine anesthesia masks have 4 point head strap harnesses to securely fit on the head to hold the mask in place as the anaethesia doctor controls the gases and oxygen inhaled oxygen masks are used by climbers of high peaks such as mt everest  because of the severe cold and harsh conditions oxygen masks for use at extreme altitude must be robust and effective the oxygen storage tanks used with the masks called oxygen bottles are made of lightweight highstrength metals and are covered in highstrength fiber such as kevlar these special oxygen bottles are filled with oxygen at a very high pressure which provides a longer time duration of oxygen for breathing than standard pressure oxygen bottles these systems are generally only used above 7000 metres 23000ft in recent years oxygen mask systems for highaltitude climbing which pump oxygen constantly have been increasingly replaced by systems supplying oxygen on demand via nasal cannulas  oxygen helmets are used in hyperbaric oxygen chambers for oxygen administration  they are transparent lightweight plastic helmets with a seal that goes around the wearers neck that looks like a space suit helmet they offer a good visual field light weight plastic hoses provide oxygen to the helmet and remove exhaled gas to the outside of the chamber oxygen helmets are often preferred for oxygen administration in hyperbaric oxygen chambers for children and patients that are uncomfortable wearing an oxygen mask medical oxygen masks are held in place by medical personnel or the user by hand or they may be fitted with a lightweight elastic headband so the mask can be removed quickly fullface masks are secured by several straps tightly fitting oxygen masks are secured at four points by two head straps aviators masks are often equipped with quick don harnesses that allow those in pressurized aircraft to rapidly don the masks in emergencies military aviators oxygen masks are secured to flight helmets with quickrelease systems

V a pacemaker or artificial pacemaker so as not to be confused with the hearts natural pacemaker is a medical device which uses electrical impulses delivered by electrodes contracting the heart muscles to regulate the beating of the heart the primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate heart rate either because the hearts natural pacemaker is not fast enough or because there is a block in the hearts electrical conduction system modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a cardiologist to select the optimum pacing modes for individual patients some combine a pacemaker and defibrillator in a single implantable device others have multiple electrodes stimulating differing positions within the heart to improve synchronisation of the lower chambers ventricles of the heart in 1889 john alexander macwilliam reported in the british medical journal bmj of his experiments in which application of an electrical impulse to the human heart in asystole caused a ventricular contraction and that a heart rhythm of 6070 beats per minute could be evoked by impulses applied at spacings equal to 6070minute  in 1926 dr mark c lidwill of the royal prince alfred hospital of sydney supported by physicist edgar h booth of the university of sydney devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which one pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber the pacemaker rate was variable from about 80 to 120 pulses per minute and likewise the voltage variable from 15 to 120 volts in 1928 the apparatus was used to revive a stillborn infant at crown street womens hospital sydney whose heart continued to beat on its own accord at the end of 10 minutes of stimulation   in 1932 american physiologist albert hyman working independently described an electromechanical instrument of his own powered by a springwound handcranked motor hyman himself referred to his invention as an artificial pacemaker the term continuing in use to this day   an apparent hiatus in publication of research conducted between the early 1930s and world war ii may be attributed to the public perception of interfering with nature by reviving the dead for example hyman did not publish data on the use of his pacemaker in humans because of adverse publicity both among his fellow physicians and due to newspaper reporting at the time lidwell may have been aware of this and did not proceed with his experiments in humans  an external pacemaker was designed and built by the canadian electrical engineer john hopps in 1950 based upon observations by cardiothoracic surgeon wilfred gordon bigelow at toronto general hospital a substantial external device using vacuum tube technology to provide transcutaneous pacing it was somewhat crude and painful to the patient in use and being powered from an ac wall socket carried a potential hazard of electrocution of the patient by inducing ventricular fibrillation a number of innovators including paul zoll made smaller but still bulky transcutaneous pacing devices in the following years using a large rechargeable battery as the power supply  in 1957 william l weirich published the results of research performed at the university of minnesota these studies demonstrated the restoration of heart rate cardiac output and mean aortic pressures in animal subjects with complete heart block through the use of a myocardial electrode  in 1958 colombian doctor alberto vejarano laverde and colombian electrical engineer jorge reynolds pombo constructed an external pacemaker similar to those of hopps and zoll weighing 45kg and powered by a 12 volt car lead acid battery but connected to electrodes attached to the heart this apparatus was successfully used to sustain a 70yearold priest gerardo florez the development of the silicon transistor and its first commercial availability in 1956 was the pivotal event which led to rapid development of practical cardiac pacemaking in 1958 engineer earl bakken of minneapolis minnesota produced the first wearable external pacemaker for a patient of c walton lillehei this transistorized pacemaker housed in a small plastic box had controls to permit adjustment of pacing heart rate and output voltage and was connected to electrode leads which passed through the skin of the patient to terminate in electrodes attached to the surface of the myocardium of the heart one of the earliest patients to receive this lucas pacemaker device was a woman in her early 30s in an operation carried out in 1964 at the radcliffe infirmary in oxford by cardiac surgeon dr alf gunning from south africa and later professor gunning   who was a student of dr christiaan barnard this pioneering operation was carried out under the guidance of cardiac consultant dr peter sleight at the radcliffe infirmary in oxford and his cardiac research team at st georges hospital in london dr sleight later became professor of cardiovascular medicine at oxford university   the first clinical implantation into a human of a fully implantable pacemaker was in 1958 at the karolinska institute in solna sweden using a pacemaker designed by rune elmqvist and surgeon ke senning connected to electrodes attached to the myocardium of the heart by thoracotomy the device failed after three hours a second device was then implanted which lasted for two days the worlds first implantable pacemaker patient arne larsson went on to receive 26 different pacemakers during his lifetime he died in 2001 at the age of 86 outliving the inventor as well as the surgeon  in 1959 temporary transvenous pacing was first demonstrated by seymore furman and john schwedel whereby the catheter electrode was inserted via the patients basilic vein  in february 1960 an improved version of the swedish elmqvist design was implanted in montevideo uruguay in the casmu 1 hospital by doctors orestes fiandra and roberto rubio that device lasted until the patient died of other ailments nine months later the early swedishdesigned devices used rechargeable batteries which were charged by an induction coil from the outsideit was the first pacemaker implanted in america implantable pacemakers constructed by engineer wilson greatbatch entered use in humans from april 1960 following extensive animal testing the greatbatch innovation varied from the earlier swedish devices in using primary cells mercury battery as the energy source the first patient lived for a further 18 months the first use of transvenous pacing in conjunction with an implanted pacemaker was by parsonnet in the usa    lagergren in sweden   and jeanjaques welti in france  in 196263 the transvenous or pervenous procedure involved incision of a vein into which was inserted the catheter electrode lead under fluoroscopic guidance until it was lodged within the trabeculae of the right ventricle this method was to become the method of choice by the mid1960s cardiothoracic surgeon leon abrams and medical engineer ray lightwood developed and implanted the first patient controlled variable rate heart pacemaker in 1960 at birmingham university the first implant took place in march 1960 with two further implants the following month these three patients made good recoveries and returned to a high quality of life by 1966 56 patients had undergone implantation with one surviving for over 5 years   the preceding implantable devices all suffered from the unreliability and short lifetime of the available primary cell technology which was mainly that of the mercury battery in the late 1960s several companies including arco in the usa developed isotopepowered pacemakers but this development was overtaken by the development in 1971 of the lithiumiodide cell by wilson greatbatch lithiumiodide or lithium anode cells became the standard for future pacemaker designs a further impediment to reliability of the early devices was the diffusion of water vapour from the body fluids through the epoxy resin encapsulation affecting the electronic circuitry this phenomenon was overcome by encasing the pacemaker generator in a hermetically sealed metal case initially by telectronics of australia in 1969 followed by cardiac pacemakers inc of minneapolis in 1972 this technology using titanium as the encasing metal became the standard by the mid1970s in july 9 of 1974 manuel a villafaa and anthony adducci founders of cardiac pacemakers inc guidant in st paul minneosta manufactured the worlds first pacemaker with a lithium anode and a lithiumiodide electrolyte solidstate battery   others who contributed significantly to the technological development of the pacemaker in the pioneering years were bob anderson of medtronic minneapolis jg geoffrey davies of st georges hospital london barouh berkovits and sheldon thaler of american optical geoffrey wickham of telectronics australia walter keller of cordis corp of miami hans thornander who joined previously mentioned rune elmquist of elemaschonander in sweden janwillem van den berg of holland and anthony adducci of cardiac pacemakers inc  in 2013 multiple firms announced devices that could be inserted via a leg catheter rather than invasive surgery the devices are roughly the size and shape of a multivitamin much smaller than the size of a traditional pacemaker once implanted the devices prongs contact the muscle and stabilize heartbeats engineers and scientists are currently working on this type of device  in november 2014 a patient bill pike of fairbanks alaska received a medtronic micra pacemaker in providence st vincent hospital in portland oregon doctor d randolph jones md was the ep doctor in 2014 also st jude medical inc announced the first enrollments in the companys leadless pacemaker observational study evaluating the nanostim leadless pacing technology the nanostim pacemaker received ce marking in 2013 the postapproval implants have occurred in europe  the european study was recently stopped after there were reports of six perforations that led to two patient deaths after investigations st jude medical restarted the study  but in the united states this therapy is still not approved by the fda  while the st jude nanostim and the medtronic micra are just singlechamber pacemakers it is anticipated that leadless dualchamber pacing for patients with atrioventricular block will become possible with further development  percussive pacing also known as transthoracic mechanical pacing is the use of the closed fist usually on the left lower edge of the sternum over the right ventricle in the vena cava striking from a distance of 20  30cm to induce a ventricular beat the british journal of anaesthesia suggests this must be done to raise the ventricular pressure to 1015mmhg to induce electrical activity this is an old procedure used only as a life saving means until an electrical pacemaker is brought to the patient  transcutaneous pacing tcp also called external pacing is recommended for the initial stabilization of hemodynamically significant bradycardias of all types the procedure is performed by placing two pacing pads on the patients chest either in the anteriorlateral position or the anteriorposterior position the rescuer selects the pacing rate and gradually increases the pacing current measured in ma until electrical capture characterized by a wide qrs complex with a tall broad t wave on the ecg is achieved with a corresponding pulse pacing artifact on the ecg and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult external pacing should not be relied upon for an extended period of time it is an emergency procedure that acts as a bridge until transvenous pacing or other therapies can be applied temporary epicardial pacing is used during open heart surgery should the surgical procedure create atrioventricular block the electrodes are placed in contact with the outer wall of the ventricle epicardium to maintain satisfactory cardiac output until a temporary transvenous electrode has been inserted transvenous pacing when used for temporary pacing is an alternative to transcutaneous pacing a pacemaker wire is placed into a vein under sterile conditions and then passed into either the right atrium or right ventricle the pacing wire is then connected to an external pacemaker outside the body transvenous pacing is often used as a bridge to permanent pacemaker placement it can be kept in place until a permanent pacemaker is implanted or until there is no longer a need for a pacemaker and then it is removed permanent pacing with an implantable pacemaker involves transvenous placement of one or more pacing electrodes within a chamber or chambers of the heart while the pacemaker is implanted inside the skin under the clavicle the procedure is performed by incision of a suitable vein into which the electrode lead is inserted and passed along the vein through the valve of the heart until positioned in the chamber the procedure is facilitated by fluoroscopy which enables the physician to view the passage of the electrode lead after satisfactory lodgement of the electrode is confirmed the opposite end of the electrode lead is connected to the pacemaker generator there are three basic types of permanent pacemakers classified according to the number of chambers involved and their basic operating mechanism  modern pacemakers usually have multiple functions the most basic form monitors the hearts native electrical rhythm when the pacemaker does not detect a heartbeat within a normal beattobeat time period it will stimulate the ventricle of the heart with a short low voltage pulse this sensing and stimulating activity continues on a beat by beat basis the more complex forms include the ability to sense andor stimulate both the atrial and ventricular chambers from this the basic ventricular on demand pacing mode is vvi or with automatic rate adjustment for exercise vvir  this mode is suitable when no synchronization with the atrial beat is required as in atrial fibrillation the equivalent atrial pacing mode is aai or aair which is the mode of choice when atrioventricular conduction is intact but the natural pacemaker the sinoatrial node is unreliable  sinus node disease snd or sick sinus syndrome where the problem is atrioventricular block avb the pacemaker is required to detect sense the atrial beat and after a normal delay 0102 seconds trigger a ventricular beat unless it has already happened  this is vdd mode and can be achieved with a single pacing lead with electrodes in the right atrium to sense and ventricle to sense and pace these modes aair and vdd are unusual in the us but widely used in latin america and europe   the dddr mode is most commonly used as it covers all the options though the pacemakers require separate atrial and ventricular leads and are more complex requiring careful programming of their functions for optimal results cardiac resynchronization therapy crt is used for people with heart failure in whom the left and right ventricles do not contract simultaneously ventricular dyssynchrony which occurs in approximately 2550 of heart failure patients to achieve crt a biventricular pacemaker bvp is used which can pace both the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle by pacing both sides of the left ventricle the pacemaker can resynchronize the ventricular contractions crt devices have at least two leads one passing through the vena cava and the right atrium into the right ventricle to stimulate the septum and another passing through the vena cava and the right atrium and inserted through the coronary sinus to pace the epicardial wall of the left ventricle often for patients in normal sinus rhythm there is also a lead in the right atrium to facilitate synchrony with the atrial contraction thus timing between the atrial and ventricular contractions as well as between the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle can be adjusted to achieve optimal cardiac function crt devices have been shown to reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients with heart failure symptoms a lv ejection fraction less than or equal to 35 and qrs duration on ekg of 120ms or greater   biventricular pacing alone is referred to as crtp for pacing for selected patients at risk of arrhythmias crt can be combined with an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator icd such devices known as crtd for defibrillation also provide effective protection against lifethreatening arrhythmias  a major step forward in pacemaker function has been to attempt to mimic nature by utilizing various inputs to produce a rateresponsive pacemaker using parameters such as the qt interval po2  pco2 dissolved oxygen or carbon dioxide levels in the arterialvenous system physical activity as determined by an accelerometer body temperature atp levels adrenaline etc instead of producing a static predetermined heart rate or intermittent control such a pacemaker a dynamic pacemaker could compensate for both actual respiratory loading and potentially anticipated respiratory loading the first dynamic pacemaker was invented by anthony rickards of the national heart hospital london uk in 1982  dynamic pacemaking technology could also be applied to future artificial hearts advances in transitional tissue welding would support this and other artificial organjointtissue replacement efforts stem cells may or may not be of interest to transitional tissue welding  many advancements have been made to improve the control of the pacemaker once implanted many of these have been made possible by the transition to microprocessor controlled pacemakers pacemakers that control not only the ventricles but the atria as well have become common pacemakers that control both the atria and ventricles are called dualchamber pacemakers although these dualchamber models are usually more expensive timing the contractions of the atria to precede that of the ventricles improves the pumping efficiency of the heart and can be useful in congestive heart failure rate responsive pacing allows the device to sense the physical activity of the patient and respond appropriately by increasing or decreasing the base pacing rate via rate response algorithms the david trials  have shown that unnecessary pacing of the right ventricle can exacerbate heart failure and increases the incidence of atrial fibrillation the newer dual chamber devices can keep the amount of right ventricle pacing to a minimum and thus prevent worsening of the heart disease a pacemaker is typically inserted into the patient through a simple surgery using either local anesthetic or a general anesthetic the patient may be given a drug for relaxation before the surgery as well an antibiotic is typically administered to prevent infection  in most cases the pacemaker is inserted in the left shoulder area where an incision is made below the collar bone creating a small pocket where the pacemaker is actually housed in the patients body the lead or leads the number of leads varies depending on the type of pacemaker are fed into the heart through a large vein using a fluoroscope to monitor the progress of lead insertion the right ventricular lead would be positioned away from the apex tip of the right ventricle and up on the interventricular septum below the outflow tract to prevent deterioration of the strength of the heart the actual surgery may take about 30 to 90 minutes following surgery the patient should exercise reasonable care about the wound as it heals there is a followup session during which the pacemaker is checked using a programmer that can communicate with the device and allows a health care professional to evaluate the systems integrity and determine the settings such as pacing voltage output the patient should have the strength of his or her heart analyzed frequently with echocardiography every 1 or 2 years to make sure the that placement of the right ventricular lead has not led to weakening of the left ventricle the patient may want to consider some basic preparation before the surgery the most basic preparation is that people who have body hair on the chest may want to remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a depilatory agent preoperative shaving has been on the decline as it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure as the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body since a pacemaker uses batteries the device itself will need replacement as the batteries lose power device replacement is usually a simpler procedure than the original insertion as it does not normally require leads to be implanted the typical replacement requires a surgery in which an incision is made to remove the existing device the leads are removed from the existing device the leads are attached to the new device and the new device is inserted into the patients body replacing the previous device international pacemaker patient identification cards carry information such as patient data among others symptom primary ecg aetiology pacemaker center doctor hospital ipg rate mode date of implantation manufacturer type and lead type   once the pacemaker is implanted it is periodically checked to ensure the device is operational and performing appropriately depending on the frequency set by the following physician the device can be checked as often as is necessary routine pacemaker checks are typically done inoffice every six 6 months though will vary depending upon patientdevice status and remote monitoring availability at the time of inoffice followup the device will be interrogated to perform diagnostic testing these tests include as modern pacemakers are ondemand meaning that they only pace when necessary device longevity is affected by how much it is utilized other factors affecting device longevity include programmed output and algorithms features causing a higher level of current drain from the battery an additional aspect of the inoffice check is to examine any events that were stored since the last followup these are typically stored based on specific criteria set by the physician and specific to the patient some devices have the availability to display intracardiac electrograms of the onset of the event as well as the event itself this is especially helpful in diagnosing the cause or origin of the event and making any necessary programming changes a patients lifestyle is usually not modified to any great degree after insertion of a pacemaker there are a few activities that are unwise such as full contact sports and activities that involve intense magnetic fields the pacemaker patient may find that some types of everyday actions need to be modified for instance the shoulder harness of a vehicle seatbelt may be uncomfortable if the harness should fall across the pacemaker insertion site any kind of an activity that involves intense magnetic fields should be avoided this includes activities such as arc welding possibly with certain types of equipment  or maintaining heavy equipment that may generate intense magnetic fields such as a magnetic resonance imaging mri machine however in february 2011 the fda approved a new pacemaker device called the revo mri surescan  which is the first to be labeled conditional  for mri use  there are several limitations to its use including certain patients qualifications body parts and scan settings a 2008 us study has found  that the magnets in some headphones included with portable music players when placed within an inch of pacemakers may cause interference some medical procedures may require the use of antibiotics to be administered before the procedure the patient should inform all medical personnel that he or she has a pacemaker some standard medical procedures such as the use of mri may be ruled out by the patient having a pacemaker in addition according to the american heart association some home devices have a remote potential to cause interference by occasionally inhibiting a single beat cellphones available in the united states less than 3 watts do not seem to damage pulse generators or affect how the pacemaker works  a panel of the heart rhythm society a specialist organization based in washington dc found that it was legal and ethical to honor requests by patients or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients to deactivate implanted cardiac devices lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube though there is currently no legal precedent involving pace makers in the united states of america a patient in the united states is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive physicians have a right to refuse to turn it off but are advised by the hrs panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will  some patients believe that hopeless debilitating conditions like those brought on by severe strokes or latestage dementia can cause so much suffering that they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures such as cardiac devices  security and privacy concerns have been raised with pacemakers that allow wireless communication unauthorized third parties may be able to read patient records contained in the pacemaker or reprogram the devices as has been demonstrated by a team of researchers  the demonstration worked at short range they did not attempt to develop a long range antenna the proof of concept exploit helps demonstrate the need for better security and patient alerting measures in remotely accessible medical implants  in response to this threat purdue university and princeton university researchers have developed a prototype firewall device called medmon which is designed to protect wireless medical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps from attackers  a possible complication of dualchamber artificial pacemakers is pacemakermediated tachycardia pmt a form of reentrant tachycardia in pmt the artificial pacemaker forms the anterograde atrium to ventricle limb of the circuit and the atrioventricular av node forms the retrograde limb ventricle to atrium of the circuit  treatment of pmt typically involves reprogramming the pacemaker  another possible complication is pacemakertracked tachycardia where a supraventricular tachycardia is tracked by the pacemaker and produces beats from a ventricular lead this is becoming exceedingly rare as newer devices are often programmed to recognize supraventricular tachycardias and switch to nontracking modes sometimes the leads which are small diameter wires from the pacemaker to the implantation site in the heart muscle will need to be removed the most common reason for lead removal is infection however over time leads can degrade due to a number of reasons such as lead flexing  changes to programming of the pacemaker may overcome lead degradation to some extent however a patient who has several pacemaker replacements over a decade or two in which the leads were reused may require a lead replacement surgery lead replacement may be done in one of two ways insert a new set of leads without removing the current leads not recommended as it provides additional obstruction to blood flow and heart valve function or remove the current leads and then insert replacements the lead removal technique will vary depending on the surgeons estimation of the probability that simple traction will suffice to more complex procedures leads can normally be disconnected from the pacemaker easily which is why device replacement usually entails simple surgery to access the device and replace it by simply unhooking the leads from the device to replace and hooking the leads to the new device the possible complications such as perforation of the heart wall come from removing the leads from the patients body the other end of a pacemaker lead is actually implanted into the heart muscle in addition leads that have been implanted for a decade or two will usually have attachments to the patients body at various places in the pathway from device to heart muscle since the human body tends to incorporate foreign devices into tissue in some cases such as a device that has been inserted for a short amount of time removal may involve simple traction to pull the lead from the body removal in other cases is typically done with a cutting device which threads over the lead and is moved down the lead to remove any organic attachments with tiny cutting lasers or similar device pacemaker lead malposition in various locations has been described in the literature depending on the location of the pacer lead and symptoms treatment varies  another possible complication called twiddlers syndrome occurs when a patient manipulates the pacemaker and causes the leads to be removed from their intended location and causes possible stimulation of other nerves sometimes devices resembling pacemakers called implantable cardioverterdefibrillators icds are implanted these devices are often used in the treatment of patients at risk from sudden cardiac death an icd has the ability to treat many types of heart rhythm disturbances by means of pacing cardioversion or defibrillation some icd devices can distinguish between ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia vt and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of vt to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation this is known as fastpacing overdrive pacing or antitachycardia pacing atp atp is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia and is never effective if the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation

V an infusion pump infuses fluids medication or nutrients into a patients circulatory system it is generally used intravenously although subcutaneous arterial and epidural infusions are occasionally used infusion pumps can administer fluids in ways that would be impractically expensive or unreliable if performed manually by nursing staff for example they can administer as little as 01 ml per hour injections too small for a drip injections every minute injections with repeated boluses requested by the patient up to maximum number per hour eg in patientcontrolled analgesia or fluids whose volumes vary by the time of day because they can also produce quite high but controlled pressures they can inject controlled amounts of fluids subcutaneously beneath the skin or epidurally just within the surface of the central nervous system  a very popular local spinal anesthesia for childbirth   the user interface of pumps usually requests details on the type of infusion from the technician or nurse that sets them up some pumps offer modes in which the amounts can be scaled or controlled based on the time of day this allows for circadian cycles which may be required for certain types of medication there are two basic classes of pumps large volume pumps can pump nutrient solutions large enough to feed a patient smallvolume pumps infuse hormones such as insulin or other medicines such as opiates within these classes some pumps are designed to be portable others are designed to be used in a hospital and there are special systems for charity and battlefield use largevolume pumps usually use some form of peristaltic pump classically they use computercontrolled rollers compressing a siliconerubber tube through which the medicine flows another common form is a set of fingers that press on the tube in sequence smallvolume pumps usually use a computercontrolled motor turning a screw that pushes the plunger on a syringe the classic medical improvisation for an infusion pump is to place a blood pressure cuff around a bag of fluid the battlefield equivalent is to place the bag under the patient the pressure on the bag sets the infusion pressure the pressure can actually be readout at the cuffs indicator the problem is that the flow varies dramatically with the patients blood pressure or weight and the needed pressure varies with the administration route potentially causing risk when attempted by an individual not trained in this method places that must provide the leastexpensive care often use pressurized infusion systems one common system has a purposedesigned plastic pressure bottle pressurized with a large disposable plastic syringe a combined flow restrictor air filter and drip chamber helps a nurse set the flow the parts are reusable massproduced sterile plastic and can be produced by the same machines that make plastic softdrink bottles and caps a pressure bottle restrictor and chamber requires more nursing attention than electronically controlled pumps in the areas where these are used nurses are often volunteers or very inexpensive the restrictor and high pressure helps control the flow better than the improvised schemes because the high pressure through the small restrictor orifice reduces the variation of flow caused by patients blood pressures an air filter is an essential safety device in a pressure infusor to keep air out of the patients veins small bubbles could cause harm in arteries but in the veins they pass through the heart and leave in the patients lungs the air filter is just a membrane that passes gas but not fluid or pathogens when a large air bubble reaches it it bleeds off some of the smallest infusion pumps use osmotic power basically a bag of salt solution absorbs water through a membrane swelling its volume the bag presses medicine out the rate is precisely controlled by the salt concentrations and pump volume osmotic pumps are usually recharged with a syringe springpowered clockwork infusion pumps have been developed and are sometimes still used in veterinary work and for ambulatory smallvolume pumps they generally have one spring to power the infusion and another for the alarm bell when the infusion completes battlefields often have a need to perfuse large amounts of fluid quickly with dramatically changing blood pressures and patient condition specialized infusion pumps have been designed for this purpose although they have not been deployed many infusion pumps are controlled by a small embedded system they are carefully designed so that no single cause of failure can harm the patient for example most have batteries in case the wallsocket power fails additional hazards are uncontrolled flow causing an overdose uncontrolled lack of flow causing an underdose reverse flow which can siphon blood from a patient and air in the line which can cause an air embolism the range of safety features varies widely with the age and make of the pump a state of the art pump in 2003  may have the following safety features infusion pumps have been a source of multiple patient safety concerns and problems with such pumps have been linked to more than 56000 adverse event reports from 2005 to 2009 including at least 500 deaths  as a result the us food and drug administration fda has launched a comprehensive initiative to improve their safety called the infusion pump improvement initiative  the initiative proposed stricter regulation of infusion pumps it cited software defects user interface issues and mechanical or electrical failures as the main causes of adverse events

V neurostimulation is a therapeutic activation of part of the nervous system using microelectrodes the electrodes are used to interface with excitable tissue in order to either restore sensation such as a cochlear implant for hearing or control an organ such as a heart pacemaker  neurostimulation technology improves the life quality of those who are severely paralyzed or suffering from profound losses to various sense organs it serves as the key part of neural prosthetics for hearing aids artificial vision artificial limbs and brainmachine interfaces in the case of neural stimulation mostly an electrical stimulation is utilized and chargebalanced biphasic constant current waveforms or capacitively coupled charge injection approaches are adopted alternatively the transcranial magnetic stimulation has been proposed as a noninvasive method in which a magnetic field causes neurostimulation    the primary findings about neurostimulation originated from the idea to stimulate nerves for therapeutic purposes the 1st recorded use of electrical stimulation for pain relief goes back to 46 ad when scribonius largus used torpedo fish electric ray for relieving headaches  in the late 18th century luigi galvani discovered that the muscles of dead frog legs twitched when struck by direct current on the nervous system  the modulation of the brain activity by electrical stimulation of the motor cortex in dogs was shown in 1870 that resulted in limb movement  from the late 18th century to today many milestones have been developed nowadays sensory prosthetic devices such as visual implants cochlear implants auditory midbrain implants and spinal cord stimulators and also motor prosthetic devices such as deep brain stimulators bion microstimulators the brain control and sensing interface and cardiac electrostimulation devices are widely used  brain stimulation has potentials to treat some disorders such as epilepsy in this method scheduled stimulation is applied to specific cortical or subcortical targets there are available commercial devices  that can deliver an electrical pulse at scheduled time intervals scheduled stimulation is hypothesized to alter the intrinsic neurophysiologic properties of epileptic networks the most explored targets for scheduled stimulation are the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the hippocampus the anterior nucleus of the thalamus has been studied which has shown a significant seizure reduction with the stimulator on versus off during several months after stimulator implantation  moreover the cluster headache ch can be treated by using a temporary stimulating electrode at sphenopalatine ganglion spg pain relief is reported within several minutes of stimulation in this method  to avoid use of implanted electrodes researchers have engineered ways to inscribe a window made of zirconia that has been modified to be transparent and implanted in mice skulls to allow optical waves to penetrate more deeply as in optogenetics to stimulate or inhibit individual neurons  deep brain stimulation dbs has shown benefits for movement disorders such as parkinsons disease tremor and dystonia and affective disorders such as depression obsessivecompulsive disorder tourette syndrome chronic pain and cluster headache since dbs can directly change the brain activity in a controlled manner it is used to map fundamental mechanisms of brain functions along with neuroimaging methods a simple dbs system consists of two different parts first tiny microelectrodes are implanted in the brain to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue second an electrical pulse generator pg generates stimulation pulses which is connected to the electrodes via microwires physiological properties of the brain tissue which may change with disease state stimulation parameters which include amplitude and temporal characteristics and the geometric configuration of the electrode and the surrounding tissue are all parameters on which dbs of both the normal and the diseased brain depend on in spite of a huge amount of studies on dbs its mechanism of action is still not well understood developing dbs microelectrodes is still challenging  spinal cord stimulation scs is an effective therapy for the treatment of chronic and intractable pain including diabetic neuropathy failed back surgery syndrome complex regional pain syndrome phantom limb pain ischemic limb pain refractory unilateral limb pain syndrome postherpetic neuralgia and acute herpes zoster pain another pain condition that is a potential candidate for scs treatment is charcotmarietooth cmt disease which is associated with moderate to severe chronic extremity pain  scs therapy consists of the electrical stimulation of the spinal cord to mask pain the gate theory proposed in 1965 by melzack and wall  provided a theoretical construct to attempt scs as a clinical treatment for chronic pain this theory postulates that activation of large diameter myelinated primary afferent fibers suppresses the response of dorsal horn neurons to input from small unmyelinated primary afferents a simple scs system consists of three different parts first microelectrodes are implanted in the epidural space to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue second an electrical pulse generator implanted in the lower abdominal area or gluteal region while is connected to the electrodes via wires and third a remote control to adjust the stimulus parameters such as pulse width and pulse rate in the pg improvements have been made in both the clinical aspects of scs such as transition from subdural placement of contacts to epidural placement which reduces the risk and morbidity of scs implantation and also technical aspects of scs such as improving percutaneous leads and fully implantable multichannel stimulators however there are many parameters that need to be optimized including number of implanted contacts contact size and spacing and electrical sources for stimulation the stimulus pulse width and pulse rate are important parameters that need to be adjusted in scs which are typically 400 us and 8200hz respectively  compared to electrical stimulation that utilizes brief highvoltage electric shock to activate neurons which can potentially activate pain fibers transcranial magnetic stimulation tms was developed by baker in 1985 tms uses a magnetic wire above the scalp which carries a sharp and high current pulse a time variant magnetic field is induced perpendicular to the coil due to the applied pulse which consequently generates an electric field based on maxwells law the electric field provides the necessary current for a noninvasive and much less painful stimulation there are two tms devices called single pulse tms and repetitive pulse tms rtms while the latter has greater effect but potential to cause seizure tms can be used for therapy particularly in psychiatry as a tool to measure central motor conduction and a research tool to study different aspects of human brain physiology such as motor function vision and language the rtms method has been used to treat epilepsy with rates of 825hz for 10 seconds the other therapeutic uses of rtms include parkinson diseases dystonia and mood diseases also tms can be used to determine the contribution of cortical networks to specific cognitive functions by disrupting activity in the focal brain region  early inconclusive results have been obtained in recovery from coma persistent vegetative state by pape et al 2009  cochlear implants have provided partial hearing to more than 120000 persons worldwide as of 2008 the electrical stimulation is used in a cochlear implant to provide functional hearing in totally deafened persons cochlear implants include several subsystem components from the external speech processor and radio frequency rf transmission link to the internal receiver stimulator and electrode arrays modern cochlear implant research started in the 1960s and 1970s in 1961 a crude single electrode device was implanted in two deaf patients and useful hearing with electric stimulation was reported the first fda approved complete single channel device was released in 1984  in cochlear implants the sound is picked up by a microphone and transmitted to the behindtheear external processor to be converted to the digital data the digitized data is then modulated on a radio frequency signal and transmitted to an antenna inside a headpiece the data and power carrier are transmitted through a pair of coupled coils to the hermetically sealed internal unit by extracting the power and demodulating the data electric current commands are sent to the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve through microelectrodes  the key point is that the internal unit does not have a battery and it should be able to extract the required energy also to reduce the infection data is transmitted wirelessly along with power inductively coupled coils are the best candidate for power and data telemetry parameters needed by the internal unit include the pulse amplitude pulse duration pulse gap active electrode and return electrode that are used to define a biphasic pulse and the stimulation mode an example of the commercial devices include nucleus 22 device that utilized a carrier frequency of 25mhz and later in the newer revision called nucleus 24 device the carrier frequency was increased to 5mhz  the internal unit in the cochlear implants is an asic applicationspecific integrated circuit chip that is responsible to ensure safe and reliable electric stimulation inside the asic chip there is a forward pathway a backward pathway and control units the forward pathway recovers digital information from the rf signal which includes stimulation parameters and some handshaking bits to reduce the communication error the backward pathway usually includes a back telemetry voltage sampler that reads the voltage over a period of time on the recording electrode the stimulator block is responsible to deliver predetermined current by external unit to the microelectrodes this block includes a reference current and a digital to analog converter to transform digital commands to an analog current  theoretical and experimental clinical evidences suggest that direct electrical stimulation of the retina might be able to provide some vision to subjects who have lost the photoreceptive elements of their retina  therefore visual prostheses are developed to restore vision for the blind by using the stimulation depending upon which visual pathway location is targeted for neural stimulation different approaches have been considered visual pathway consists mainly of the eye optic nerve lateral geniculate nucleus lgn and visual cortex therefore retinal optic nerve and visual cortex stimulation are the three different methods used in visual prostheses  retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa rp and agerelated macular degeneration amd are two likely candidate diseases in which retinal stimulation may be helpful three approaches called intraocular epiretinal subretinal and extraocular transretinal stimulation are pursued in retinal devices that stimulate remaining retinal neural cells to bypass lost photoreceptors and allow the visual signal to reach the brain via the normal visual pathway in epiretinal approach electrodes are placed on the top side of the retina near ganglion cells  whereas the electrodes are placed under the retina in subretinal approaches  finally the posterior scleral surface of the eye is the place in which extraocular approach electrodes are positioned second sight and the humayun group at usc are the most active groups in the design of intraocular retinal prostheses the argustm 16 retinal implant is an intraocular retinal prosthesis utilizing video processing technologies regarding to the visual cortex stimulation brindley and dobelle were the first ones who did the experiments and demonstrated that by stimulating the visual cortex most of the electrodes can produce visual percept  lgn which is located in the midbrain to relay signals from the retina to the visual cortex is another potential area that can be used for stimulation but this area has limited access due to surgical difficulty the recent success of deep brain stimulation techniques targeting the midbrain has encouraged research to pursue the approach of lgn stimulation for a visual prosthesis  implantable pacemakers were proposed for the first time in 1959 and became more sophisticated since then the therapeutic application of pacemakers consists of numerous rhythm disturbances including some forms of tachycardia too fast a heart beat heart failure and even stroke early implantable pacemakers worked only a short time and needed periodic recharging by an inductive link these implantable pacemakers needed a pulse generator to stimulate heart muscles with a certain rate in addition to electrodes  today modern pulse generators are programmed noninvasively by sophisticated computerized machines using rf obtaining information about the patients and devices status by telemetry also they use a single hermetically sealed lithium iodide lii cell as the battery the pacemaker circuitry includes sense amplifiers to detect the hearts intrinsic electrical signals which are used to track heart activity rate adaptive circuitry which determine the need for increased or reduced pacing rate a microprocessor memory to store the parameters telemetry control for communication protocol and power supplies to provide regulated voltage  microelectrodes are one of the key components of the neurostimulation which deliver the current to neurons typical microelectrodes have three main components a substrate the carrier a conductive metal layer and an insulation material in cochlear implants microelectrodes are formed from platinumiridium alloy stateoftheart electrodes include deeper insertion to better match the tonotopic place of stimulation to the frequency band assigned to each electrode channel improving efficiency of stimulation and reducing insertion related trauma these cochlear implant electrodes are either straight or spiral such as med el combi 40 and advanced bionics helix microelectrodes respectively in visual implants there are two types of electrode arrays called planar type or three dimensional needle or pillar type where needle type array such as utah array is mostly used for cortical and optic nerve stimulations and rarely used in retinal implants due to the possible damage of retina however a pillarshaped gold electrode array on thinfilm polyimide has been used in an extraocular implant on the other hand planar electrode arrays are formed from flexible polymers such as silicone polyimide and parylene as candidates for retinal implants regarding to dbs microelectrodes an array which can be controlled independently distributed throughout the target nucleus would permit precise control of the spatial distribution of the stimulation and thus allow better personalized dbs there are several requirements for dbs microelectrodes that include long lifetime without injury to the tissue or degradation of the electrodes customized for different brain sites longterm biocompatibility of the material mechanically durable in order to reach the target without being damaged during handling by the implant surgeon and finally uniformity of performance across the microelectrodes in a particular array tungsten microwire iridium microwires and platinumiridium microelectrodes are the examples of microelectrode used in dbs  silicon carbide is a potential interesting material for realizing biocompatible semiconductor devices  in march 2014 the fda approved cefaly a device that stimulates the trigeminal nerve with an externally applied electrode while it does not relieve migraines when they are in progress users who wear the device for 20 minutes a day suffer fewer migraines a month according to clinical trials  in addition to the enormous usage of neurostimulation for clinical applications it is also used widely in laboratories started dates back to 1920s by people link delgado who used stimulation as an experimental manipulation to study basics of how the brain works the primary works were on the reward center of the brain in which stimulation of those structures led to pleasure that requested more stimulation another most recent example is the electrical stimulation of the mt area of primary visual cortex to bias perception in particular the directionality of motion is represented in a regular way in the mt area they presented monkeys with moving images on screen and monkey throughput was to determine what the direction is they found that by systematically introducing some errors to the monkeys responses by stimulating the mt area which is responsible for perceiving the motion in another direction the monkey responded to somewhere in between the actual motion and the stimulated one this was an elegant use of stimulation to show that mt area is essential in the actual perception of motion within the memory field stimulation is used very frequently to test the strength of the connection between one bundle of cells to another by applying a small current in one cell which results in the release of neurotransmitters and measuring the postsynaptic potential generally a short but highfrequency current in the range of 100hz helps strengthening the connection known as longterm potentiation however longer but lowfrequency current tends to weaken the connections known as longterm depression
